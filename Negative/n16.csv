"26471339","1","26471585","","2014-10-20 17:22:21","","-1","111","<p>I am in doubt about how cin works with two statements, in my program I need to get at first, a sequence of numbers from the user and put them in a vector, and after a number B which will sum the first B elements of that vector, for example, if the user enters the sequence 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and to B she enters 3, so the program will sum 5, 4 and 3. But the problem is that the second user input to A is handing the value to B, I used a while loop to get the sequence of values to A but from the second value the cin goes to B and then I get a out_of_range error, here is my code: </p>

<pre><code>#include ""std_lib_facilities.h""
using namespace std;

vector&lt;int&gt; nums;
void sum();

int main()
{
    int a;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Please enter some numbers (press | at prompt to stop)"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    while(cin&gt;&gt;a) nums.push_back(a); //get a series of numbers

    sum();
}

void sum()
{

    int b,c = 0;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Please enter how many of the numbers you wish to sum, starting from the first"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    cin&gt;&gt;b; //get the number of elements the user wants to sum
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; b+1; ++i){
        c += nums[i];
    }

    cout &lt;&lt; ""The sum of the first "" &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; "" numbers is "" &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; endl;
}

<p><a href=""https://developers.google.com/+/web/signin/javascript-flow"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/+/web/signin/javascript-flow</a> .</p>

<p>and copied the code in the last steps of the instructions. I have entered my CLIENT_ID that i got when i followed the instructions in the 'tutorial' but my button just doesn't work. I also searched for some examples and are quite different from the code i found in the google site. I feel that i am missing something (actually i think that i am doing something stupid :) ).</p>

<p>Does that mean, in every request, I should try as much as I can to use asynchronous processing (in ASP.NET MVC I assume it's asynchronous controller instead of PageAsyncTask as in ASP.NET, correct me if I'm wrong) whenever there's a call to WCF service (or if I don't use WCF service, then whenever I have a call to database) to increase the throughput of server, increase number of requests that server can process at one time?</p>

<p>Another question which is a bit related: does anyone know or can point me to an article that explains about connection limit when connecting to WCF from web layer like this? I heard that the limit is 5 concurrent connections at a time for WCF but cannot confirm. If it's 5 concurrent connections, it means the bottleneck is in WCF even if I increase throughput of web layer?</p>

<p>Is there some way to avoid explicitly naming the plot file, and have the org-mode latex export engine generate these file-names?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'm including the solution that G. Jay Kerns pointed to here for easy reference: all you need to do is include a temp-file-generating emacs-lisp function in the header, like <code>:file (org-babel-temp-file ""./figure-"" "".pdf"")</code>. This creates a temp figure-file in the current directory (because of the <code>./</code>).

<p>For example, I have this file called Profesor.hbm.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;hibernate-mapping&gt;
        &lt;class name=""model.Profesor"" table=""Profesor"" catalog=""dbo""&gt;
            &lt;id name=""idProfesor"" type=""int""&gt;
                &lt;column name=""idProfesor"" /&gt;
                &lt;generator class=""assigned"" /&gt;
            &lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;property name=""Nombre"" type=""string""&gt;
            &lt;column name=""Nombre""  length=""25"" not-null=""false"" /&gt;
        &lt;/property&gt;
        &lt;property name=""ApellidoP"" type=""string""&gt;
            &lt;column name=""ApellidoP"" length=""20"" not-null=""false"" /&gt;
        &lt;/property&gt;

        &lt;property name=""ApellidoM"" type=""string""&gt;
            &lt;column name=""ApellidoM"" length=""20"" not-null=""false"" /&gt;
        &lt;/property&gt;
            &lt;/class&gt;

        &lt;sql-query name=""getProfesors"" callable=""true""&gt;
        &lt;return alias=""getProfesors"" class=""model.Profesor""&gt;

        &lt;return-property name=""idProfesor"" column=""idProfesor""/&gt;
        &lt;return-property name=""Nombre"" column=""Nombre""/&gt;
        &lt;return-property name=""ApellidoP"" column=""ApellidoP""/&gt;
        &lt;return-property name=""ApellidoM"" column=""ApellidoM""/&gt;
        &lt;/return&gt;
        exec getProfesors :idTT
        &lt;/sql-query&gt;
&lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then in my Profesor class I have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>SessionFactory sf = new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory();
session = sf.getCurrentSession();

public List &lt;Profesor&gt; getProfesors(String idTT){
    session.beginTransaction();

    query.setString(""idTT"", idTT);

return query.list();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works perfectly, I have no problem, the stored procedure executes and it populates my model Class named Profesor with the results.</p>

<p>Now I have another stored procedure which INSERTs data to create a new Profesor in the Database.</p>

<p>I tried something like this with no success:</p>

<pre><code>session.beginTransaction();
Connection c = session.connection();
CallableStatement cs = c.prepareCall( ""{call addProfesor(?,?,?)}"" ) ;
cs.setString(1, ""George"");
cs.setString(2, ""Williams"");
cs.setString(3, ""Mathematics"");

cs.executeUpdate();
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't even show me an error message, the data just won't insert. 
I was also reading that just like there is a &lt;""sql-query""> tag, there is a &lt;""sql-insert"">
but then I can't see the way to call that &lt;""sql-insert""> because it doesn't have a ""name"" attribute just like sql-query does.</p>

<p>With &lt;""sql-query""> we could do:</p>

<pre><code> Query query =session.getNamedQuery(""getProfesors"");
</code></pre>

<p>Just like I showed before, but since sql-insert doesnt have that attribute name I don't know how to do it. I'm also forced to use Stored procedures since it's a very special requirement, otherwise I would have used other Hibernate persistance features.</p>

<p>Any help would be really appreciated.</p>

I am finding that if I specify the <em>search method</em> (by including ""Engine:=.."") the macro turns off the <em>Automatic Calculation</em> (found in <em>Formulas>Calculation Options</em>) and switches it to manual. This essentially fixes the optimsation at a single point, even though the below optimisation is on a loop as it optimises to different values. As the cells that are linked to each other do not update because of this problem this renders the optimisation useless.
I can run the macro without specifying the search method but ideally I would like to be able to choose it. Any ideas?</p>

<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/889435/can-mod-rewrite-preserve-a-double-slash"">3</a></p>

<p>But this question is slightly different.</p>

<p>Say I have a RewriteRule like:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^test/([\w]*)/([\w]*)/([\w]*)/?$ go.php?q=THREE_$1_$2_$3
</code></pre>

<p>So <a href=""http://localhost/test/a/b/c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/test/a/b/c</a> gets rewritten to <a href=""http://localhost/go.php?q=THREE_a_b_c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/go.php?q=THREE_a_b_c</a></p>

<p>Now say I want to explicitly catch the condition where the middle parameter is left out and a double slash results, like <a href=""http://localhost/test/a//c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/test/a//c</a></p>

<p>So I write a rule like:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^test/([\w]*)//([\w]*)/?$ go.php?q=TWO_$1_(EMPTY)_$2
</code></pre>

<p><strong>BUT ALAS</strong>, the rule never matches, it seems RewriteRule <em>does not see the double slash</em>, even though the double slash <em>is</em> preserved in both <code>%{THE_REQUEST}</code> and <code>%{REQUEST_URI}</code>.</p>

<p>So I write a rule like:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} //
RewriteRule ^test/([\w]*)/([\w]*)/?$ go.php?q=TWO_$1_(NONE)_$2
</code></pre>

<p>And <strong>that</strong> works, because the RewriteCond only applies if there's a double slash in the REQUEST_URI.  But as you can see I still have to assume there's NO double slash there when parsing with the regex.</p>

<p>All this is very disturbing because I thought RewriteRule worked on %{REQUEST_URI} but it turns out it <em>doesn't</em>, it works on something else (a double slash stripped version..?)</p>

<p>My question really is, if not raw %{REQUEST_URI} then what does RewriteRule feed on?</p>

<p>Currently, I use a naive method. Nodes are created at random locations in 2d space (where x and y are unsigned integers between 0 and some MAX_SPACE constant). Edges are randomly created to connect the nodes, so that each node has an outdegree of at least 1 (and at most MAX_DEGREE). Indegree is not enforced. Then I search for a path between the first and last Nodes in the set, which may or may not be connected.</p>

<p>In a more realistic situation, nodes would have a probability of being connected proportional to their proximity in 2d space. What is a good strategy to build random test graphs with that property?</p>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>

<p>I will primarily use this to build graphs that can be drawn and verified by hand, but scaling to larger graphs is a consideration.</p>

<p>The strategy should be easily modified to support the following constants (and maybe others -- let me know if you think of any interesting ones):</p>

<ul>
<li>MIN_NODES, MAX_NODES: a range of sizes for the graph</li>
<li>CONNECTEDNESS: average out-degree</li>
<li>PROXIMITY: weight given to preferring to connect proximal nodes</li>
</ul>

        B b = new B(this);

    public void GO() { _a.DoSomething(); }

<p>Based on above I'm wondering about any convention clashes the occur, or problems that come into effect when you do something like this, is it bad to do this? I know that there definitely brings up some thread safety issues. But my overall question is ok to do this, does it bring up some other issues? How would I update values in the main thread?
The reason why I want it separate is because class B has a timer in it(not in shown code) that when it runs out does somethings, then tells class A that it has finished, resets the timer and goes back to sleep until the timer runs out again, how would I do that otherwise?</p>

<p>Once the user has authenticated I would like to dismiss the modal login view controller but from some reason the parent view controller has lost reference to the modal controller. The login view controller begins the process of opening a session using the Facebook SDK. Facebook will open it's own web view for user authentication. Could this be responsible?</p>

<p>If the user has successfully authenticated the modal login view calls the above method on the parent view controller. However self.presentingViewController is nil. So the modal view is never dismissed. Can someone help tell what I'm doing wrong here?</p>

<p>I want to have lightbox open when zoom icon clicked .</p>

"32538366","1","32538645","","2015-09-12 11:42:05","","1","23","<p>I'm working on a game prototype that is going to involve generating a map from Delaunay triangles created from a very large list of points (easily in the hundred thousand range, as it's going to be a small planet), however to get to that I'm going to need a nice distribution of points in a large circle.</p>

<p>The reason I'm specifically using Delaunay triangles is because it will be fairly easy to enforce a maximum size for triangles by limiting side length. With Voronoi cells I would have to look at the area the cell occupies which is considerably more intensive, and I'm not really aware of other nice methods of generating polygons from points.</p>

<p>I know how to uniformly place random points so outer layers contain more in proportion to their area, however I need to then smooth the points to ensure there's no large gaps or dense clusters of points for the Delaunay set. A good example of what I need is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd&#39;s_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">Lloyd's Algorithm</a>, however I would prefer a method that runs as fast as possible to achieve a roughly uniform distribution, as it should churn through all the points in no more than a couple of minutes on an average low-end CPU (let's say 2GHz single-core).</p>

<p>A good baseline in my opinion for determining it to be roughly uniform is by examining every point and looking at the distance to the nearest neighbour. If the smallest minimum distance for a point is at least twice as small as the largest, it's not uniform.</p>

<p>If required, I can modify my point distribution function to create a roughly even distribution with quadrants if the smoothing requires a reasonable starting point, or you can supply your own. However, this will only apply if it saves considerable amounts of time compared to not doing it (which I'd expect to be the case as it reduces worst-case scenarios).</p>

<p>Finally, an answer which conforms the smoothing to a set radii is worth more than one which requires altering the result, and an answer that can conform to a given radial height-map (via function calls to an angle) is worth even more as I plan on creating a radial height-map already (flat planets are boring). Also, code examples in Java are inherently more useful as I'll be making my game in that, but other code examples are fine.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how I should tackle the problem of smoothing points in a circle with maximum efficiency?</p>

<p>I want to binding the property IsEnabled in btn_test in usrctrl_Camera_Control and btn_test in MainWindow into IsNyetEnabled in MainWindow. I set the IsNyetEnabled into false before I do InitializeComponent() in MainWindow.</p>

<p>The binding between btn_test.IsEnabled in MainWindow into IsNyetEnabled in MainWindow is done flawlessly. The btn_test in MainWindow is no longer enabled. (I know, I need to implement INotifyPropertyChanged to notify the subsriber if there is any change but for now, just leave it as is for simplicity).</p>

<p>But, the binding between btn_test.IsEnabled in usrctrl_Camera_Control into IsNyetEnabled in MainWindow is failed. I have used Visual Studio ""Create Data Binding"" wizard but it always return error when compiling.</p>

<pre><code>System.Windows.Data Error: 4 : Cannot find source for binding with reference 'RelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorType='TA141501005.MainWindow', AncestorLevel='1''.

<p>Do you have any suggestion? I have tried for whole day without a luck.
Is there any way to access parent datacontext without removing this.Datacontext = this?
Looking forward for your suggestion and explanation.
Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Edit.
I display my UserControl via Flyout.</p>

<pre><code>Window parentWindow = Window.GetWindow(this);
object obj = parentWindow.FindName(""mainFlyout"");
Flyout flyout = (Flyout) obj;  
flyout.Content = new SomeFlyOutUserControl();
flyout.IsOpen = !flyout.IsOpen;

<p>I don't know what is wrong everytime i set a column in public List getAllNapChecks() it gets bugged and says i only have five columns i don't know i've been doing this for hours..Thanks in advance..Just tell if you need more</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;NapCheck&gt; getAllNapChecks() {
    List&lt;NapCheck&gt; NapList = new ArrayList&lt;NapCheck&gt;();
    // Select All Query
    String selectQuery = ""SELECT  * FROM "" + TABLE_NapS;

    SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();

<p>It renders the correct number of ListBoxItems, but is only displaying the first value in each item. Where am I going wrong? I know this has to be something really easy I'm just missing. </p>

<p>In our first unit test an Akka Actor is created which then instantiate a new Task object, sets it's enum field, and persists the Task object via the DAO. Once the Actor has done it's part we're back to the unit test thread and we use the DAO to get the Task object, which it finds but the enum field is null. If I check the database the enum column definitely has a value.</p>

<p>In our second unit test we remove the Akka Actor out of the equation. Instantiate a Task, set enum field and persist all in the unit test. This time when we use the DAO to do a lookup  everything is there, enum field included. </p>

<p>So why in the first unit test we are unable to retrieve a persisted Task with the correct enum value? The DAO scope has not been set so the same DAO instance should be used in both the Actor and inside the unit test. </p>

"5926164","1","","","2011-05-08 07:20:23","","0","106","<p>In several projects I've been working on I have encountered the need to fetch random rows from large (>1M rows) tables. With tables this large, <code>ORDER BY rand() LIMIT 1</code> is no option as it will quickly bring the database to it's knees.</p>

<p>The usual solution has been to generat a random number between <code>MIN(id)</code> and <code>MAX(id)</code> and select that row directly. However, if there are big gaps in the id sequence this will require either lots of re-rolls or using <code>WHERE id &gt;= :myrandomnumber</code> which will lead to rows that succeed large gaps getting significantly more hits than average.</p>

<p>I've been thinking to solve this problem by creating a new indexed column solely for randomizing purposes, say <code>id2</code>. This column would always be a gapless sequence between 1 and the number of rows in the table.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What would be the best way to keep this sequence gapless?</p>

<p>The first solution that comes to mind is creating a helper table <code>recycled_ids</code> that will contain columns <code>tablename</code> and <code>id2</code>. Whenever a row is deleted from <code>tablename</code>, the <code>id2</code> of that row is inserted to <code>recycled_ids</code>. When new rows are inserted, the <code>id2</code> is either selected from <code>recycled_ids</code> or if none are available, a new one is created. Is there a simpler way?</p>

<p><strong>Bonus questions:</strong> Are there ORMs or frameworks that already do this or have otherwise efficient random row selection? Is this an existing pattern, does it have a name?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I wrote a quick benchmark for this and ran it against a table with 125,000 rows and 30,000 gaps between them. The results are pretty promising:</p>

<pre><code>Fetch a random row 100 times using id2: 0.0234689712524 seconds
Fetch a random row 100 times using ORDER BY rand() LIMIT 1: 54.992347002 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>When inserting the test data, I removed one random row for every five rows inserted. The sequence stays gapless the whole time.</p>

<pre><code>for($i=1; $i&lt;=$amount; $i++) {
    insert_row();
    if($i % 5 == 0)
        delete_random_row();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Running that loop again with <code>$amount = 10000</code> takes 9 seconds on my low-end vserver. That's 0.009 seconds per row and it includes deleting a random row every five iterations. It does get slower as the table grows, but fetching a random row does not.</p>

<p>My original questions still apply.</p>

If I switch the feature on, then the other links work but the links in the WCM content fail.

"9385442","1","9385692","","2012-02-21 21:28:22","","0","409","<p>I found a very useful Doctrine function to set an attribute on a table for getting the database IDs also as keys in the resulting Doctrine_Collection. This function is documented here: <a href=""http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/1.2/docs/manual/component-overview/en#collection:key-mapping"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/1.2/docs/manual/component-overview/en#collection:key-mapping</a></p>

<p>Now the question. I cannot use the table object itself, because I need to create a dynamic query on the table (and not the magic finders as in the example).</p>

<p>I tried this code:</p>

<pre><code>$doctrineTable = Doctrine_Core::getTable($table);
$doctrineTable-&gt;setAttribute(Doctrine_Core::ATTR_COLL_KEY, ""id"");
$q = $doctrineTable-&gt;createQuery(""t"");
foreach ($filter as $c =&gt; $v) // lopp thru coumns
    if (is_array($v)) // use whereIn if value is an array
        $q-&gt;andWhereIn(""t."" . $c, $v);
    elseif (is_null($v)) // use is null for null values
        $q-&gt;andWhere(""t."" . $c . "" IS NULL"");
    else // use where in other cases
        $q-&gt;andWhere(""t."" . $c . ""=?"", $v);
return $q-&gt;fetchAll();
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately the resulting collection is still not using an associative array, but a normal one just using keys from 0 up.</p>

<p>Anybody has an idea how to achieve that for a query on a single table?</p>

<p>Cheers,
Daniel</p>

<p><code>Main</code></p>

<p><code>----Test</code></p>

<p><code>--------Dev</code></p>

<p>However at some point in the past someone has done a baseless merge between Dev and Main. this is causing a great deal of confusion as Developers are now accidentally merging code directly from Dev to Main. </p>

<p>This is causing pain with unforeseen merge conflicts when code follows the correct process and is merged from Test to Main, as well as potentially creating a scenario where untested code is promoted to the Main branch.</p>

<p>Is there any way to remove the branching relationship between Dev and Main without deleting the branch? I would like to keep the Dev branch and it's relationship with Test. Just remove the relationship with Main. </p>

<p>I've tried to convert the branch to a folder to remove the relationships but this doesn't work. I can reparent the branch but there doesn't seem to be any obvious way to remove the relationship completely. I could convert the branch to a folder, then delete it and rebranch from Test but this will mean making sure that the codebase is synchronised which may be difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>----------------Oringinal Question------------</p>

<p>First I try the following somewhat direct way:</p>

vec[0][0] = 'h';

<p>But compiling the code I get a warning:</p>

<p>And running the ./a.out I get a </p>

<p>I think it is because I try to write to a const char. So I try another way:</p>

<pre><code>char s1[] = ""Hello"", s2[] = ""World"";
vector&lt;char *&gt; vec = {s1, s2};
vec[0][0] = 'h';

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM table 
  ORDER BY HAMMINGDISTANCE(hash, UNHEX(&lt;insert supplied sha256 hash here&gt;)) ASC 
  LIMIT 10
</code></pre>

<p>(in case you're wondering, the Hamming distance of strings A and B is defined as <code>BIT_COUNT(A^B)</code>, where ^ is the bitwise XOR operator and BIT_COUNT returns the number of 1s in the binary string).</p>

<p>Now, I know that both the ^ operator and BIT_COUNT function only work on INTEGERs and so I'd say that probably the only way to do it would be to break up the binary strings in substrings, cast each binary substring to integer, compute the Hamming distance substring-wise and then add them. The problem with this is that it sounds terribly complicated, not efficient and definitely not elegant. My question therefore is: could you suggest any better way? (please note that I'm on shared hosting and therefore I can't modify the DB server or load libraries)</p>

<p>edit(1): Obviously loading the whole table in PHP and doing the computations there would be possible but I'd rather avoid it because this table will probably grow quite large.</p>

<p>edit(2): The DB server is MySQL 5.1</p>

<p>edit(3): My answer below contains the code that I just described above.</p>

<p><strong>edit(4): I just found out that using 4 BIGINTs to store the hash instead of a BINARY(32) yields massive speed improvements (more than 100 times faster). See the comments to my answer below.</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>But each <code>UserControl</code> needs to comunicate with the others. I've searched and I found that a solution is to use <code>Event Aggregator</code>, but I haven't found any interesting manual/guide, and I'm not sure on how to send information with that.</p>

<p>Why I need to comunicate between user controls? The blue one (for example) has a DataGrid. Left one has an update button, so when I press on <code>update</code>, I want the datagrid to save changes on blue area. Right area receives some user info, and prints it.</p>

<p>Can anybody help me?</p>

<p>The next step after knowing how to receive these fields is to know what to do with them. i know how can i place <code>linea_equipo</code> in a text-field [with the code I posted in the script above the JAVA code] but i also need to set as ""selected"" one option in each of these lists (two are dropdown lists and the other is a datalist) taking into account that they are already filled; just need to place selected attribute in the value that matches the field that the form must receive from this ajax-jsp thing. 
(selectArea - <code>id_area</code>, listaCentrosDeArea - <code>nombre_centro</code>, listaRolNuevaTarea - <code>id_rol</code>)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""selectArea"" &gt;
    &lt;%out.print(f.getSelectAreas(conex));%&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;datalist id=""listaCentrosDeArea"" id=""datalist1""&gt;

<p>If an object does not have a 'subPageArray', I would like there to NOT be a sub-list under that item.</p>

<pre><code>$.each(json.siteMap, function (i, val) {
    var i = 0,
        a = i++,
        data = ""&lt;li class='topLevel'&gt;&lt;a href='/"" + this.link + ""'&gt;"" + this.title + ""&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class='subLevel'&gt;&lt;a href='/"" + this.subPageArray[i].link + ""'&gt;"" + this.subPageArray[a].subTitle + ""&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"";
        i++;    
        $(data).appendTo("".siteMapContent ul"");
});
</code></pre>

<p>And my HTML looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""siteMapContent""&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to extract values like variantID, productCode, name which are the child nodes for node ""variant"".</p>

<p>All I did was using XML Binding wizard to get the wrapper unit and threw a XMLDocument component in the form.</p>

<p>My code so far to parse the 'productCode':</p>

<pre><code>procedure TForm1.ParseXMl(const aXMLText: string);
var
  EnvelopeType: IXMLEnvelopeType;
  ProductCode: string;
begin
  XMLDocument1.XML.Text := aXMLText;
  EnvelopeType := GetEnvelope(XMLDocument1);

  ProductCode := EnvelopeType.Body.GetListOfAllLatestVariantsResponse.Result.Variant.ProductCode.Text;
  Memo2.Text := 'Product Code: ' + ProductCode;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, everytime I get empty string value for the required node values.</p>

<p>How can I display this data simultaneously on a Javascript chart? The problem I run into with jqPlot (what I'm used to) is it will display all the series but it's impossible to tell the values that go from 0-1 apart from each other and whether they are 0 or 1 at that moment in time.</p>

// set an empty cache
NSURLCache *sharedCache = [[NSURLCache alloc] initWithMemoryCapacity:0 diskCapacity:0 diskPath:nil];
[NSURLCache setSharedURLCache:sharedCache];

// remove the cache for a particular request

I destroyed my webview, all my variable... and so much else that I can not remember.

I'm using GLSL to transform the model appropriately, but the normals always seem to be incorrect after rotating them with every combination of model matrix, view matrix, inverse, transpose, etc that I could think of. The model matrix is just a rotation around the y-axis using glm:</p>

<pre><code>angle += deltaTime;
modelMat = glm::rotate(glm::mat4(), angle, glm::vec3(0.f, 1.f, 0.f));
</code></pre>

<p>My current vertex shader code (I've modified the normal line many many times):</p>

<pre><code>#version 150 core
uniform mat4 projMat;
uniform mat4 viewMat;
uniform mat4 modelMat;
in vec3 inPosition;
in vec3 inNormal;
out vec3 passColor;

void main()
{
    gl_Position = projMat * viewMat * modelMat * vec4(inPosition, 1.0);
    vec3 normal = normalize(mat3(inverse(modelMat)) * inNormal);
    passColor = normal;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And my fragment shader:</p>

<pre><code>#version 150 core
in vec3 passColor;
out vec4 outColor;

void main()
{
    outColor = vec4(passColor, 1.0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know for sure that the uniform variables are being passed to the shader properly, as the model itself gets transformed properly, and the initial normals are correct if I do calculations such as directional lighting.</p>

<p>I've created a GIF of the rotating model, sorry about the low quality:
<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/LgLKHCb.gif?1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/LgLKHCb.gif?1</a></p>

<p>What confuses me the most is how the normals appear to rotate on multiple axis, which I don't think should happen when multiplied by a simple rotation matrix on one axis. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I've added some more of the client code below.</p>

<p>This is where the buffers get bound for the model, in the <code>Mesh</code> class (<code>vao</code> is <code>GLuint</code>, defined in the class):</p>

I manually upload the model's transformation matrix before rendering, however (which is only a rotation matrix, the <code>Transform</code> class (returned by Mesh::getTransform()) will only do a glm::rotation() since I was trying to figure out the problem).</p>

We were wondering if there are any tools (external or provided by hostingrails) to address those two basic requirements:
- development / production versions of a Rails application
- simultaneous live versions of the application (versioned APIs) for example to keep supporting older versions of the client application iPhone.</p>

<p>A first approach we are thinking of right now would be to duplicate the application for each version of the API we want to have, each of them being referenced by a specific URL for example:  <em>myapp.com/v1</em> , <em>myapp.com/v2 .</em>.. 
This entire stack would itself be duplicated in order to have a live/production version, and a development one. Once tested, the development version would be switched with the production version.</p>

<p>What do you think of this approach ? Are there any tools that allow to manage the lifecycle of the application ? 
Does Rails has built-in features facilitating this ?</p>

<p>I am probably trying to over-complicate things, so if you can think of an easier way of doing this I'm all ears.</p>

<p>My specific problem relates to ASP.NET MVC, using Attributes (Filters) on an Action method. I'm trying to create a filter that will paginate the results passed to the ViewData.Model like this:</p>

<pre><code>[PagedList(PageSize = 2, ListType = typeof(Invoice))]
public ViewResult List()
{
    var invoices = invoicesRepository.Invoices; // Returns an IQueryable&lt;Invoice&gt;
    return View(Invoices);
}
</code></pre>

<p>My filter's <strong>OnActionExecuted</strong> override then looks like:</p>

<pre><code>public override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext)
{
    ViewResult result = (ViewResult)filterContext.Result;
    var list = (IQueryable&lt;?&gt;)result.ViewData.Model; // Here I want to use the ListType in place of the ?

    // Perform pagination
    result.ViewData.Model = list.Skip((Page - 1) * PageSize).Take(PageSize.ToList();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I realise I could replace my</p>

<pre><code>var list = (IQueryable&lt;?&gt;)result.ViewData.Model;
</code></pre>

<p>With</p>

<pre><code>var list = (IQueryable)result.ViewData.Model;
IQueryable&lt;Object&gt; oList = list.Cast&lt;Object&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>But my view is strongly typed to expect an </p>

<pre><code>IQueryable&lt;Invoice&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>not an</p>

<p>Getting some not very usefull error about <code>@INC</code> and list of paths. What is this? Now after some googling we know that <code>@INC</code> contains paths where to search our modules, and this error means that Perl can't find out MyModule.pm.<br></p>

<p>Now we can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add path to system PERL5LIB var, it will add our path to the beginning of <code>@INC</code>
Install our module to one of dirs from <code>@INC</code></li>
<li>Manually add our path to <code>@INC</code> in the <code>BEGIN</code> section
Add <code>use lib '/home/user/GreatScript';</code> to our script, but it looks bad. What if we will move our script to other dir?</li>
<li>Or use <code>FindBin</code> module to find our current dir, and use this path in <code>use lib ""$FindBin::Bin"";</code>, but it's not 100% effective, for example some bugs with mod_perl or <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/FindBin.html#KNOWN-ISSUES"" rel=""nofollow"">issues</a>...</li>
<li>Or use __FILE__ (or $0) variable and extract path from it using <code>abs_path</code> method from <code>Cwd</code> module. Looks like a yet another bicycle?</li>
<li>Or some forgotten or missing ( Did I miss something? )</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Why this obvious and regular operation need a lot of work?</b> If I have one script, it's easy... But why I need to write this few additional lines of code to all my scripts? And it will not work 100%! Why perl not adding current script dir to <code>@INC</code> by default, like it does with "".""?</p>

<p>Let's say I have the following array:</p>

<pre><code>    A = [[0, 0, 100],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0]] 
</code></pre>

<p>If I want to calculate the correlation of this array with another, by multiplying the corresponding entries. For example, A*A would be equal to A (1*1 = 1, zeros everywhere else). I read that fast fourier transforms can be used to speed this up with large arrays. From what I read, I got the impression if I wanted to multiply two arrays A and B, as in A*B, that I could do it quicker with the following (using numpy in python):</p>

<pre><code>a = np.conj(np.fft.fftn(A))
b = np.fft.fftn(B)
c = np.fft.ifft(a*b)
</code></pre>

<p>So in effect, take the fft of A, take the fft of B, multiply the two results, and then get the inverse of that result. However, I tried it with the case of A given above, multiplying itself. I had hoped the inverse multiplication would give me </p>

<pre><code>[[0, 0, 10000],
 [0, 0, 0    ],
 [0, 0, 0    ]]
</code></pre>

<p>However I got something a bit different, closer to</p>

<pre><code>[[10000, 0, 0],
 [10000, 0, 0],
 [10000, 0, 0]]
</code></pre>

<p>does anyone know what's going on? Sorry, I'm guessing there's something I'm misunderstanding about the fft. </p>

It include a div with some javascripts that get some ""non-statical"" strings from a server and print them on the page. Until here everything works fine, the problem is that I would like to update the execution of this div every few seconds in order to have updated strings, without refreshing the whole page, but just the specific widget (div). I have added another script that tries to refresh the specific div, but I had no luck. Please see the code below</p>

<p>This problem happens in Chrome (Chromium) not in Firefox.</p>

<p>I have a form with reset button.
I saw that to use a button with type=""reset"" could be the more clear way to reset the form, including to clean the content of not validate input like email.</p>

<p>The button is disabled or not by ngDisable directive with value that comes from the controller:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button ng-disabled=""isUnchanged(customer)"" type=""reset"" ng-click=""reset(customer)""&gt;Reset&lt;/button&gt;

<p>where, in the controller, isUnchanged is:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.isUnchanged = function(customer) {
    return angular.equals(customer, $scope.master);
};
</code></pre>

<p>Well, in this situation clicking on the reset button all the input fields are cleaned but NOT the email field.</p>

<p>Setting ng-disable=""false"" all works WELL.</p>

<p>Maybe the value of the function is read later conflicting with the default function of the button?</p>

However the problem is that an object that corresponds to XML in xstream, needs to have all the tags as attributes; else if XML contains any extra tags which are not present in object; it bombs. </p>

<p>Or, we need to have custom convertors written to make sure that the operation goes as desired. I was also suggested that common digester allows Xpath parsing from XML to an object.</p>

<p>I'm new to Groovy and Java and maybe i have a error in reasoning and there is a simpler solution for such a problem...please help me :)</p>

<p>I meant if I browsed in youtube the small window of the twebbrowser will resize itself to the size of the video of youtube video.</p>

<p>Here, there is a simple html table and in that inner tables. What I want is to align the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> holding the data rowX (with green color) with the left column's last <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> (with green color).</p>

<p>I want this only for that particular <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, rest all is <code>valign=""top""</code>, which is perfect. </p>

<p>Right now, I put the <code>&lt;tfoot&gt;</code> but it can be removed. No need of this, just used to show the last part of table.</p>

<p>I am using classic asp and want to avoid javascript/jquery, as it is not a part of application. Also, the number of <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> are not static, table created dynamically.</p>

The Dirty implementation of AR states that an already persisted instance is deemed only dirty if one of its direct attributes has changed. So, let's say:</p>

<pre><code>class Picture &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :gallery
  has_one :frame
end
</code></pre>

<p>in this case, I can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>p = Picture.new(:gallery =&gt; Gallery.new, :frame =&gt; Frame.new)
p.save #=&gt; it will save the three instances
p.gallery = Gallery.new
p.save #=&gt; will not save the new gallery
p.gallery_id_will_change!
p.gallery = Gallery.new
p.save #=&gt; this will save the new Gallery
</code></pre>

<p>but now I can't do something similar for the has_one association, since the Picture implementation doesn't own an attribute referring to it. So, it seems such dirty markups are impossible. Or aren't they?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>thats one of the lines so the text is not comma delimited, im already using a software called taskcentre that have a import flat file tool, so i can parse each 
field by column like: field1 = data from col 1 to col 5, field2: col6 to col10 the tool is like this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/tU9Ul.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/tU9Ul.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>and i can preview the output file, after that i would need to use something to insert those records in a temporal table, its possible to do that with bulk insert in a stored procedure?</p>

<p>Or im not sure if i should do everything in a stored procedure, but i dont want to use a format file as i already have the file formated and separared in columns.</p>

"6707475","1","14114290","","2011-07-15 13:11:07","","5","5162","<p>I am currently working on an OpenGL application to display a few 3D spheres to the user, which they can rotate, move around, etc.  That being said, there's not much in the way of complexity here, so the application runs at quite a high framerate (~500 FPS).</p>

<p>Obviously, this is overkill - even 120 would be more then enough, but my issue is that running the application at full-stat eats away my CPU, causing excess heat, power consumption, etc.  What I want to do is be able to let the user set an FPS cap so that the CPU isn't being overly used when it doesn't need to be.</p>

<p>I'm working with freeglut and C++, and have already set up the animations/event handling to use timers (using the <code>glutTimerFunc</code>).  The <code>glutTimerFunc</code>, however, only allows an integer amount of milliseconds to be set - so if I want 120 FPS, the closest I can get is <code>(int)1000/120 = 8 ms</code> resolution, which equates to 125 FPS (I know it's a neglegible amount, but I still just want to put in an FPS limit and get exactly that FPS if I know the system can render faster).</p>

<p>Furthermore, using <code>glutTimerFunc</code> to limit the FPS never works consistently.  Let's say I cap my application to 100 FPS, it usually never goes higher then 90-95 FPS.  Again, I've tried to work out the time difference between rendering/calculations, but then it always overshoots the limit by 5-10 FPS (timer resolution possibly).</p>

<p>I suppose the best comparison here would be a game (e.g. Half Life 2) - you set your FPS cap, and it always hits that exact amount.  I know I could measure the time deltas before and after I render each frame and then loop until I need to draw the next one, but this doesn't solve my 100% CPU usage issue, nor does it solve the timing resolution issue.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can implement an effective, cross-platform, variable frame rate limiter/cap in my application?  Or, in another way, is there any cross-platform (and open source) library that implements high resolution timers and sleep functions?</p>

<p>Edit: I would prefer to find a solution that doesn't rely on the end user enabling VSync, as I am going to let them specify the FPS cap.</p>

<p><strong>Edit #2: To all who recommend SDL</strong> (which <strong>I did end up porting my application to SDL</strong>), is there any difference between using the <code>glutTimerFunc</code> function to trigger a draw, or using <code>SDL_Delay</code> to wait between draws?  The documentation for each does mention the same caveats, but I wasn't sure if one was more or less efficient then the other.</p>

<p>Edit #3:  Basically, I'm trying to figure out if there is a (simple way) to implement an accurate FPS limiter in my application (again, like Half Life 2).  If this is not possible, I will most likely switch to SDL (makes more sense to me to use a delay function rather then use <code>glutTimerFunc</code> to call back the rendering function every <code>x</code> milliseconds).</p>

<p>I set up a JFrame, add a Textarea and put text there, but how can I properly test this? Or is this wrong thinking in the TDD context on my side? I want to be sure (in the TDD way), that the data gets displayed correctly! The <strong>creation</strong> of the text that gets displayed is properly covered with tests, but the <strong>displaying</strong> is not.</p>

<p>Here is a completely simplified example:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyTextDisplay {

        JFrame my_frame = new JFrame(""DisplaySomeText"");

<p>I have a WCF service hosted in a Windows service.  When the Windows service shuts down, due to upgrades, scheduled maintenance, etc, I need to gracefully shut down my WCF service.  The WCF service has methods that can take up to several seconds to complete, and typical volume is 2-5 method calls per second.  I need to shut down the WCF service in a way that allows any previously call methods to complete, while denying any new calls.  In this manner, I can reach a quiet state in ~ 5-10 seconds and then complete the shutdown cycle of my Windows service.</p>

<p>Calling <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms195520.aspx"">ServiceHost.Close</a> seems like the right approach, but it closes client connections right away, without waiting for any methods in progress to complete.  My WCF service completes its method, but there is no one to send the response to, because the client has already been disconnected.  This is the solution suggested by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1664935/gracefully-terminate-wcf-service-complete-all-open-sessions-and-restrict-new-se"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>Here is the sequence of events:</p>

<ol>
<li>Client calls method on service, using the VS generated proxy class</li>
<li>Service begins execution of service method</li>
<li>Service receives a request to shut down</li>
<li>Service calls ServiceHost.Close (or BeginClose)</li>
<li>Client is disconnected, and receives a System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException</li>
<li>Service completes service method.</li>
<li>Eventually service detects it has no more work to do (through application logic) and terminates.</li>
</ol>

<p>What I need is for the client connections to be kept open so the clients know that their service methods completed sucessfully.  Right now they just get a closed connection and don't know if the service method completed successfully or not.  Prior to using WCF, I was using sockets and was able to do this by controlling the Socket directly.  (ie stop the Accept loop while still doing Receive and Send)</p>

<p>It is important that the host HTTP port is closed so that the upstream firewall can direct traffic to another host system, but existing connections are left open to allow the existing method calls to complete.</p>

<p>Is there a way to accomplish this in WCF?</p>

<p>Things I have tried:</p>

<ol>
<li>ServiceHost.Close() - closes clients right away</li>
<li>ServiceHost.ChannelDispatchers - call Listener.Close() on each - doesn't seem to do anything</li>
<li>ServiceHost.ChannelDispatchers - call CloseInput() on each - closes clients right away</li>
<li>Override ServiceHost.OnClosing() - lets me delay the Close until I decide it is ok to close, but new connections are allowed during this time</li>
<li>Remove the endpoint using the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/547287/stop-start-wcf-mex-service-at-runtime"">technique described here</a>.  This wipes out everything.</li>
<li>Running a network sniffer to observe ServiceHost.Close().  The host just closes the connection, no response is sent.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Unfortunately I cannot implement an application-level advisory response that the system is shutting down, because the clients in the field are already deployed.  (I only control the service, not the clients)</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I used the Redgate Reflector to look at Microsoft's implementation of ServiceHost.Close.  Unfortunately, it calls some <code>internal</code> helper classes that my code can't access.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I haven't found the complete solution I was looking for, but Benjamin's suggestion to use the IMessageDispatchInspector to reject requests prior to entering the service method came closest.</p>

<p>Actually, there is a 3rd way. (from C# 5.0 in a Nutshell)</p>

<pre><code>MyValueType? x = myObject as MyValueType?;

<p>Then check <code>x.HasValue</code> and use <code>x.Value</code></p>

In the site there’s a 3 buttons for selecting payment method that will act as the continue button. What I want is when the user checks a radio buttons (I agree button), it will be add with that amount and display with previous amount.. there is three buttons which has the corresponding values(amount in pounds)..</p>

<p>plz check my website <a href=""http://www.spsmobile.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spsmobile.co.uk</a> in this linkgo to mobile phone unlocking and after add the cart click make payment it will go to next page there is a delivery mail details.. for that delivery mail details only am asking..
here i mentioned code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id=""radio-1"" type=""radio"" name=""rmr"" value=""1""&gt;

&lt;div class=""total-text"" style=""font-size:36px""&gt;£10&lt;/div&gt; 



  var total = parseInt($(""div.total-text"").text().substring(1), 10);

<p>but there is no change , my previous amount did not add with that. while am clicking previous amount only  displayed on browser.. i need when i cliks radio button the value should  change correspondingly.. where i did that mistake...plz give me some idea and what should i do..is there any need for storing db..</p>

<pre><code>public function getPassword ()
{
    if ($this -&gt; password == '')
    {
        $pw             = '';
        $charListEnd    = strlen (static::CHARLIST) - 1;
        for ($loops = mt_rand ($this -&gt; min, $this -&gt; max); $loops &gt; 0; $loops--)
        {
            $pw .= substr (static::CHARLIST, mt_rand (0, $charListEnd), 1);
        }
        $this -&gt; password   = $pw;
    }
    return $this -&gt; password;
}
</code></pre>

<p>(CHARLIST is a class constant containing a pool of characters for the password.  $min and $max are length contraints)</p>

<p>Today, when researching something else entirely I stumbled upon the following code: </p>

<pre><code>function generateRandomString ($length = 10) {    
    return substr(str_shuffle (""0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ""), 0, $length);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This accomplishes pretty much the same effect as my looping mt_rand() based code in one line.  I really like it for that simple reason, fewer lines of code is always a good thing. :)  </p>

<p>But when I looked up str_shuffle in PHP's manual the documentation on it was pretty light.  One thing I was really keen to learn was what algorithm does it use for randomness?  The manual doesn't mention what kind of randomization is done to get the shuffled string.  If it uses rand() instead of mt_rand() then sticking to my current solution may be better after all.  </p>

<p>So basically I'd like to know how str_shuffle randomizes the string.  Is it using rand() or mt_rand()?  I'm using my random string function to generate passwords, so the quality of the randomness matters.  </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: As has been pointed out, the str_shuffle method is not equivalent to the code I'm already using and will be less random due to the string's characters remaining the same as the input, only with their order changed.  However I'm still curious as to how the str_shuffle function randomizes its input string. </p>

<p>I hope the code isn't too long or too messy, I just really don't know what's happening... as far as I can tell; m_verts[] and m_tex[] look like they get filled fine, but m_ind[] keeps having wrong numbers pop up every so often through the array... Am I allocating the Array incorrectly? Am I not cleaning up something I should of?</p>

<p>Oh, and I don't think this is causing the problem, but you'll notice I haven't added anything to hadle big or little endian conversion... this is because I'm using an intel machine which seems to always assume little endian and my android game engine uses little endian... so I don't think that's the problem...</p>

<p>Any help or suggestions would be great.

It is the Vodafone 845, with a small screen (240x320p) and low density (120 dpi). It's running with Android 2.1, updated version (i.e. SDK 7), and has all the necessary hardware (GPS, cam, and internet access), but, however, doesn't detect the app in the market.
I have already tried anyDensity=""true"".

<p>Today I tried to port my project to MSVC.....
Well....</p>

<p>After realizing that MSVC doesn't support some stuff like snprintf or noexcept keyword, I'm stuck at the following piece. Actually I think I know what's going wrong, but I'd like to know why MSVC acts this way and if there are any ""easy"" ways to solve this problem.</p>

<p>Here is a minimalistic example:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;

public:
    Test(size_t size) : _size(size) {

    };

        Iterator&amp; operator ++() {
            _position++;
            return *this;
        }

        size_t operator *() {
            return _position;
        }

        bool operator !=(const Iterator &amp;rhs) {
            return _position != rhs._position;
        }
    private:
        friend class Test;
        Iterator(size_t position) : _position(position) {};
        size_t _position;
    };

    Iterator begin() {
        return Iterator(0);
    }

    Iterator end() {
        return Iterator(_size);
    }

private:
    size_t _size;
};

int main()
{

    Test t(10);

    for (auto val : t) // however, this works with MSVC
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; val &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

    std::vector&lt;size_t&gt; out(10);

    // Here it crashes
    std::transform(t.begin(), t.end(), out.begin(), [] (size_t i) {
        return i;
    });

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code successfully compiles with clang or gcc.</p>

<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/iVLib56x"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a>'s the compiler output of MSVC (sorry for the german compiler output, I'm new to Windows and I even don't know how to change the language... To be honest it took me days to install Windows -.-)</p>

<p>So let's analyze what's going wrong.</p>

<p>MSVC claims about some missing types like 'iterator_category' and many many other things.
But why does it do that? All types that are used by 'std::transform()' can actually be deduced by the return types of the members of the Iterator class and I suppose that this is the way how clang or gcc are working.</p>

<p>I don't want to write down all those types and definitions. If I would do so, the Iterator would be bigger than the underlying class itself!</p>

<p>I have a User, a User has Projects. A Project can be published or not.</p>

<p>Within Twig (in several places, in several templates) I wish to display the number of published Projects a User has.</p>

<p>This information is not stored, directly, within the Entity of the User. I could write a function to do this within the User Entity, but that would involve iterating over the Projects and checking each one's published status. This seems slow.</p>

<p>The other way is to write a query within the User Repo and get a count of all the published Projects. But that would mean ensuring that query from the Repo is executed in each Controller and then assigned to each Twig view. This feels suboptimal also as I need to count in lots of places and so would be repeating this Repo query in lots of places. Possibly in every Controller.</p>

<p>How can I therefore get this count from within Twig, from the User Entity or from the Repo?</p>

<p>To tell the server that the file is an CSV-File I added the following code to the JSP:</p>

<pre><code>response.setContentType (""application/csv"");
response.setHeader(""Content-Disposition"", ""attachment;filename=test.csv""); 
</code></pre>

<p>In the file I simply write the content of the file with an ""Writer"" object (the out-Variable).
Therefore I use the following code to gernerate the file:</p>

<pre><code>out.write(""test1;test2;etc"");
</code></pre>

<p>There are about 16 columns for this csv-file with about 3000 rows.</p>

<p>The Problem I have is that the ""Download file""-Dialog does not appear with bigger files. When I only have 128 rows it works and the Browser does show the ""Download File""-windows. When I have 129 rows the browser simply opens the file with plain text (with the IE ignoring the line breaks). This happens in every browser I tested (IE 11 and Firefox). I actually have no idea why this happens, though my guess is that it has something to do with the Writer-Object. I already tried to ""flush()"" the Writer, but this doesn't change anything. </p>

I did strip down the code to the following. When j is limited to 50 it does work. With is being set to 100, it doesn't. The .jsp is open with href.location or window.open() (it does not seem to make a difference)</p>

<p>we can set maxJsonLength 
So same way Is there any configuration needs to do in Jboss7.1.1.Final to  maximize size of json to accept large json?
If yes please provide syntax.
Also I've gone through some links about maxpostsize will it be helpful in this?
Main concern is when client sends large size json data  via HttpPost , it throws exception as above while Jboss7.1.1.Final is used</p>

<p><strong>Update#1</strong>: Solved the symptom but couldn't identify the cause of the problem. 
I loaded the assembly manually via an Assembly.load. However the above assembly resolution error kept being logged and it didn't work. 
Finally in a fit of desperation I copied my word-project DLLs into {ProjFolder}\MyAppExecs such that all the DLLs were in one folder and it started working.</p>

<p>It looks like some unmanaged dependencies of X.dll are not being resolved when I run from the {ProjFolder}... however ProcMon doesn't show any sign of that. Also updated the PATH variable to include {ProjFolder}\MyAppExecs, but no luck.
So copying it all into one single folder is what worked. X.dll is NotMyCode so couldn't probe any further.. and I had bigger fish to fry. That's it for now.</p>

<p>The main problem I am facing is the change of color of the Status Bar after dismissing <code>GKFriendRequestComposeViewController</code>.</p>

<p>In my application, I am using a dark interface with light style of Status Bar. When I call <code>GKFriendRequestComposeViewController</code>, Status Bar color changes to default (e.g. black).
When I finish my actions with <code>GKFriendRequestComposeViewController</code> — cancel or send invitation, View Controller removes, Status Bar color animates its changes to white and then instantly changes back to black.</p>

<p>I can't change this behaviour. Here is my code:</p>

<p>Code for showing <code>GKFriendRequestComposeViewController</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) inviteFriends
{
   GKFriendRequestComposeViewController *friendRequestViewController = [[GKFriendRequestComposeViewController alloc] init];
   friendRequestViewController.composeViewDelegate = self;
   [friendRequestViewController addRecipientsWithPlayerIDs: nil];

   [self presentViewController:friendRequestViewController animated:YES completion:nil];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just like in the Programming Guide.</p>

<p>Code for removing <code>GKFriendRequestComposeViewController</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)friendRequestComposeViewControllerDidFinish:(GKFriendRequestComposeViewController *)viewController
{
   [self.presentingViewController dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:^{
       NSLog(@""this code is never execute"");
   }];

   [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarStyle:UIStatusBarStyleLightContent];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here are some problems I am facing. First: If I use <code>self</code> instead of <code>self.presentingViewController</code> I receive this error:</p>

<pre><code>Warning: Attempt to dismiss from view controller &lt;UINavigationController: 0x16d45310&gt; while a presentation or dismiss is in progress! 
</code></pre>

<p>So, I use self.presentedViewController. But completion block is never called. Why?</p>

<p>My code doesn't change Status Bar style here, but I use </p>

<pre><code>[[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarStyle:UIStatusBarStyleLightContent];
</code></pre>

<p>in other app parts and it works fine.</p>

<p>By the way, <code>myApp-Info.plist</code> contains this settings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Status bar is initially hidden — NO</li>
<li>Status bar style — UIStatusBarStyleLightContent</li>
<li>View controller-based status bar appearance — NO</li>
</ul>

<p>Please help me solve this problem. Thanks.</p>

<p>I have searched and searched but cannot find anything even remotely similar. I can use the glyphicon, glyphicon glyphicon-gbp, to show the ""£"" sign before my form input, however I am unable to get it to flow correctly using the grid system.</p>

I want to define a variable in each of them which has the same name so that when i call either form from a procedure I can use that variable regardless of which form it is I am calling.</p>

<p>For example, Street form would look like this</p>

<pre><code>Public Class Street

  Public ID As Integer = 0

  Private Sub LoadForm()
    Dim myID As integer = ID
  End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>And Address form would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Public Class Address

  Public ID As Integer = 0

  Private Sub LoadForm()
    Dim myID As integer = ID
  End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>My ParentMDI menus would be:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub AddressClick()
  Call Address(Address)
End Sub

Private Sub StreetClick()
  Call Address(Street)
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>and a module that has the procedure opening the forms would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Module Caller

  Public Sub Address(ByVal frm As Form)
    '...several codes here
    If IamHappy Then
      frm.ID = 2'this is illegal because ID is not part of form parameters
    Else
      frm.ID = 3'this is illegal because ID is not part of form parameters
    End if
    frm.show()
  End Sub

End Module
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, I dont want the menus to do 'hard work' because the forms can be called from several different menus/sources. I want the public procedure in the module to be the one tasked with assigning values form my forms parameters before opening it.</p>

<p>I have seen discussions of how to send a class as a parameter, but that does not help me to get the declared value 'ID' in the form class. I am thinking there could be a way to create my own variables to become part of my forms? Or whichever method is suitable to achieve this.</p>

<p><strong>Edit to provide some more info</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>A separate login procedure will set for me a public UserID </li>
<li>MDI menu is suppose to tell me which form the user wants to open after login</li>
<li>Caller module is suppose to combine the information of which form is
requested and the ID of the user. </li>
<li>a) Set the state of the form before opening it, eg, if form tag = 2 then do not open it for this user (I am OK up to here), b) set the form's states using the Caller module then go ahead and open it. This is where the problem is. I want to set printID, for example, to 1 = user can print; or 2, user should not print.</li>
</ol>

<p>I want to manage 4. b) in the publicly declared module instead of the menu or inside the particular form because i have many forms in this application.</p>

<p>Unless there is a better way to this than how i am approaching it...</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

However this is only seen with only some graphics card but they are from different vendors. With other graphics card this behavior is not seen irrespective of that 2 byte variable.As per my understanding since the variable in option ROM run time data area so it inside the code segment of option ROM as BIOS is supposed to write protect that area during int 13, what I don't understand is how a presence of a variable inside option ROM code segment affecting BIOS behavior. I have also verified int 15 vector with and without graphics card and they are same which means graphics card is not hooking int 15.

<p>The property (attribute) named length is NSNumber as it is in a NSManagedObject class (entity).</p>

<p>Changing the Type from NSNumber! to Int! allows the line to compile and run correctly in playground.</p>

<p>Leaving the the Type as NSNumber! and changing the the offending line as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var sum = poles.reduce(0) { $0 + Int($1.length) }

<p>also compiles and run correctly in playground. The next step, taking this to the app, using actual NSManagedObject entity and attribute compiles but fails at runtime. The failure is 'unwrapping a nil'.</p>

<p>So bottom line I can't figure out how to use the reduce function when the attribute is a NSNumber and casting it to an Int doesn't seem to be acceptable.  </p>

<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff647332.aspx"">&quot;You have no control over the state and priority of a thread pool thread.&quot;<br/>
&quot;The runtime manages the thread pool. You have no control over the scheduling of the thread, nor can you change the thread's priority.&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1467194/does-changing-the-culture-of-a-threadpool-thread-affect-it-when-it-gets-returned"">
""You should not change the Culture or Priority or ... of a PoolThread. Just like you don't paint or re-decorate a rental car.""</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0ka9477y.aspx"">
""There are several scenarios in which it is appropriate to create and manage your own threads instead of using thread pool threads: (such as...) you require a thread to have a particular priority.""</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.dotnet.general/browse_thread/thread/a19ccff5b99411c7/d7c6d0bedfa1f331"">
""Each thread in ThreadPool runs at the default priority and the code to change the ThreadPriority has no effect.""</a></p>

<p>However, it is a simple matter to do so, and the debugger shows that the change <em>does</em> seem to stick (insofar as the value can be read back).</p>

<pre><code>Thread.CurrentThread.Priority = ThreadPriority.AboveNormal;
</code></pre>

<p>So the question is, what is the specific <strong>reason</strong> for this particular taboo? </p>

<p>My suspicion: doing so disturbs the delicate load balancing-assumptions of the pool. But this doesn't explain why some sources say that you <strong>can't</strong> change it.</p>

<pre><code>Sub Form_Load ()
    Comm1.CommPort = 1 [if using COM2, enter = 2]
    Comm1.Settings = “9600,N,8,1” [baud, parity, data, stop]

<pre><code>Sub Command2_Click ()

<pre><code>Sub Command3_Click ()
    Comm1.Output = “UUT_SEND ““&lt;uut command&gt;”” ” + Chr(10)

<p>There's a uut command example like so:</p>

<pre><code>“UUT_SEND ““REMS\n””
</code></pre>

<p>My question is this. Is it possible to use the C# .Net 4.0 SerialPort class to achieve this communication? I've never attempted to use a serial port before and I'm extremely new to this but I have the following in C#:</p>

<pre><code>        Comm1.PortName = ""COM1"";
        Comm1.BaudRate = 9600;
        Comm1.Parity = System.IO.Ports.Parity.None;
        Comm1.DataBits = 8;
        Comm1.StopBits = System.IO.Ports.StopBits.One;
</code></pre>

<p>How do I set Comm1.Output like it's set in the sample program? Moreover what propery in SerialPort's class corresponds with that? Will what I'm attempting even work?</p>

<p>The key point here is that the whole implementation described in the above link uses the <strong>AESEngine class</strong>. Looking at the class code and <a href=""http://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/docs1.5on/org/bouncycastle/crypto/engines/AESEngine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">javadoc reference</a>, the AESEngine is a 128bit instead of a 256 bit block cipher</p>

<p>Searching trough the code and docs i could not find the 192 or 256 bits implementations. Where are them? </p>

<p>For completeness, this is the core of my actual ciphering class:</p>

<pre><code>    private void init(String passphrase) {

            SecretKeyFactory keyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(algorithm);
            key = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec);    

        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(""NoSuchAlgorithmException occured while trying to generate the crypto key. This error should never occur, check the application code"", e);

        }

        return decrypted;
    }

    private byte[] runCipher(BufferedBlockCipher cipher, boolean forEncryption, byte[] data, byte[] iv) {
        String operation = forEncryption ? ""encrypt"" : ""decrypt"";

        try {
            KeyParameter keyParam = new KeyParameter(key.getEncoded());
            ParametersWithIV cipherParams = new ParametersWithIV(keyParam, iv);

            cipher.init(forEncryption, cipherParams);

            byte[] result = new byte[cipher.getOutputSize(data.length)];
            int len = cipher.processBytes(data, 0, data.length, result, 0);

<p>I'm having a problem with creating a structure of creating an event with several (user specifies how many) activities and each activity may occur more than once. The structure I'd like my form to have is:</p>

<pre><code>\-- Event
  Activity 1
    Time 1
    Time 2
    Time 3
  Activity 2
    Time 1
    Time 2
    Time 3
</code></pre>

<p>Where the user can add more activities, and for each activities more times.</p>

<p>models.py</p>

<pre><code>def Event(models.Model):
  # not relevant attrs

def Activity(models.Model):
  event = models.ForeignKey(Event)
  # more irrelevant stuff

def ActivityTime(models.Model):
  activity = models.ForeignKey(Activity)
  start_time = models.TimeField()
  end_time = models.TimeField()
  # more irrelevant stuff
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using modelforms to represent Event, Activity, ActivityTime. I want each time to be 'aware' of its corresponding activity for when I add the entries to the database. I'm not sure how to implement this. I haven't had luck with inline formsets but maybe because there's something I’m not understanding.</p>

It needs to be in an external Javascript file so that it can be used on a variety of pages. I've tried a variety of things but I just cant quite get it to work correctly. I'm trying to do it with only Javascript.</p>

<p>This is what I have currently, after doing some research</p>

<p>This is button I'm using to call the function</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""button"" value=""Remove"" onclick=""dynamicMessage('This product has been deleted')""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the current function I'm using is</p>

<pre><code>function dynamicMessage(argument)
{
var test = window.open(""./confirm.html"",""_self"");
test.document.write(""test"");
test.document.close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, the dynamic content isn't added in yet, but if my thinking is correct, it should just be adding the argument somewhere in the long string of html I need to add to create the page. The ""test is just do see what happens when calling the function.</p>

<p>What I want it to do is, write the ""test"" to the new window of confirm.html, but instead it overwrites the current window. But if I only call window.open, it opens to the correct window. It is the document.write part that is throwing me off.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I'm far off base on my thinking, or if its just a simple mistake I'm missing after hours of looking at this code. Any Ideas?</p>

<p>I think I need to clarify what I am trying to do. I am trying to click a button, in this case a remove button, then open up the page confirm.html, edit the content in confirm.html with the argument, and have the current page now be confirm.html. What currently happens is one of two things either the current document is edited if the ""_self"" tag is placed, or the html page is open and thus an about_blank url.</p>

<p>When executing a <code>client</code> request (as you would normally with Suds), the default Reply is used instead of the patched one.</p>

<pre><code>public class StupidUnderscore {
  public static String _() { return ""Please give me a real name!""; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>No problem, right? Just escape it:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; StupidUnderscore.`_`
res0: String = Please give me a real name!
</code></pre>

<p>And this has always worked, until I tried to update to Scala 2.10.2 this morning:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; StupidUnderscore.`_`
&lt;console&gt;:1: error: wildcard invalid as backquoted identifier
       StupidUnderscore.`_`
                        ^
</code></pre>

<p>This is due to <a href=""https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2047"">a change</a> that showed up in 2.10.1 and fixes <a href=""https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6426"">this issue</a>. From the commit message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prohibit <code>_</code> as an identifier, it can only bring badness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, sure, but I don't know why that means I can't escape it—I thought that's what backquotes were for.</p>

<p>Am I going to have to write a Java wrapper to get this to work? Is there some other way I can refer to a Java library's <code>_</code> method in Scala?</p>

<hr>

<p>As a footnote, I've confirmed that it's possible to work around this issue without writing any new Java:</p>

<pre><code>object AwfulMacroHack {
  import scala.language.experimental.macros
  import scala.reflect.macros.Context

  def _impl(c: Context) = {
    import c.universe._
    c.Expr[String](
      Select(Ident(newTermName(""StupidUnderscore"")), newTermName(""_""))
    )
  }

  def `I'm not named _!` = macro _impl
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; AwfulMacroHack.`I'm not named _!`
res0: String = Please give me a real name!
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure this is any less horrible than the Java helper solution, though.</p>

<li>pass the above through Babel, to get ES5 code</li>
<li>pack the modules with webpack</li>
<li><strong>be able to debug the result</strong></li>

<p>which kinda defeats the purpose (or one of purposes) of debugging.</p>

<p><strong>I've tried</strong> adding <code>source-map-loader</code> in various order with <code>babel-loader</code>:</p>

<pre><code>{
    test: /\.js$/,
    loader: ""source-map-loader""
}
</code></pre>

<p>to no avail.</p>

<p><em>Side note 1</em>: if I abandon webpack and just compile my modules with source maps via Babel into, say, System.js:</p>

<pre><code>babel src/ --out-dir public/js/ --debug --source-maps inline --modules system

<ul>
<li>all works properly.</li>

<p><em>Side note 2</em>: this <code>?sourceMaps=true</code> doesn't seem to do anything at all, since, if I remove source map configuration from webpack - no source maps are preserved/generated at all. One would expect the initial, Babel-produced, source maps to be preserved in the resulting files. Nope.</p>

For ambigous dates (date that can be interpreted M/d/Y or d/M/Y, it does it wrong.  I checked date field (datetime) in the MySQL table, and all the dates are stored correctly.

<p>I've done google searching and looking in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=magento%20date%20time"">StackOverflow</a>, but I'm not sure how to fix this issue.  Any ideas?
Thanks.</p>

<p>Update:
I used printLogQuery(true) on the collection to get the query it was executing.  It was as simple as: SELECT <code>main_table</code>.* FROM <code>physicians_event</code> AS <code>main_table</code>;</p>

<p>To give more background on how the date is going from the DB to HTML:
In a phtml, I iterate over a custom collection:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php foreach ($this-&gt;getEventCollection() as $_event): ?&gt;
    &lt;?php echo $this-&gt;getLayout()-&gt;createBlock('physicians/event')
                    -&gt;setEvent($_event)
                    -&gt;setTemplate('physicians/event/row.phtml')
                    -&gt;toHtml() ?&gt;
&lt;?php endforeach ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>getEventCollection looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public function getEventCollection() {
    if ($this-&gt;getSortBy() === null) {
        $this-&gt;setSortBy('date');
    }

    if ($this-&gt;getLimit() === null) {   
        $this-&gt;setLimit(10);
    }

    $collection = Mage::getModel('physicians/event')-&gt;getCollection();
    $collection-&gt;setOrder($this-&gt;getSortBy())
               -&gt;setPageSize($this-&gt;getLimit());

    if ($this-&gt;getEventType() !== null) {
        $collection-&gt;addFieldToFilter('type', array('eq' =&gt; $this-&gt;getEventType()));
    }

    return $collection;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When everything is output as HTML (row.phtml that is rendered for each item in the collection), the date is output like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;getEvent()-&gt;getFormattedDate('M/d/Y') ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The getFormattedDate function looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public function getFormattedDate($format = null, $puredate=false) {
    $date = new Zend_Date($this-&gt;getDate());
    if ($format === null) {
        $format = 'MMMM d, Y';
    }
    return (!$puredate)?$date-&gt;toString($format):$date;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I believe that is the full story so far.  Ideas?
Thank you again!</p>

<p>Update: further debugging.  Inside of getFormattedDate, I added output statements to trace where the data goes wrong:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""Collection Item Date: "" . var_export($this-&gt;getDate()) . ""&lt;br/&gt;\n"";
$date = new Zend_Date($this-&gt;getDate());
echo ""Zend Item Date: "" . var_export($date,true) . ""&lt;br/&gt;\n"";
</code></pre>

<p>The output looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>Collection Item Date: '2013-07-06 00:00:00'

Zend Item Date: Zend_Date::__set_state(array(
   '_locale' =&gt; 'en_US',
   '_fractional' =&gt; 0,
   '_precision' =&gt; 3,
   '_unixTimestamp' =&gt; '1370563200',
   '_timezone' =&gt; 'UTC',
   '_offset' =&gt; 0,
   '_syncronised' =&gt; 0,
   '_dst' =&gt; false,
))
</code></pre>

<p>Both items are correctly 7/6/2013.  I guess it is getting messed up later in the code.  The trace continues...</p>

<p>I added this:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""&lt;pre&gt;"" . var_export($date-&gt;toString($format),true) . ""&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n"";
</code></pre>

<p>And that had the output of: '6/7/2013', which is WRONG.  So the problem is in how $date->toString($format) operates...</p>

<p>On every page of my applcation that has a scrollview it's content is pushed down by 20 pixels. I think it may have something to do with the new StatusBar, or lack thereof. The bug also seems to be present in the simulators settings menu. Screenshot below. This only seems to affect the first scroll view that is added to a ViewController and only if no other views have been added to it. Table views are also being affected because they inherit from Scroll view. To be clear the scrollview starts at the correct origin but the content is pushed down by 20 pixels. This is bizarre because I would think if it was a status bar issue it would be 20 pixels above not below.  </p>

<p>Currently we are fixing it by adding this to our base view controller </p>

<pre><code>UIView *hackView = [[UIView alloc] init];
hackView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 0, 0);
[self.view addSubview:hackView];

<p>Obviously, this is a hack. </p>

<p>The same thing is happening on phone and in simulator even with the Gold Member version of IOS7 when building for latest IOS7. You can even see an example of the bug in the simulator's settings tableview and also in ours below. </p>

<p>This is a screenshot immediately after it loads. One bizarre thing that we noticed is that when we execute a pull to refresh it will correct the scrollview and rest at it's correct location. Alternatively, if we compensate it will look correct in the beginning but any subsequent pull to refreshes will migrate the scrollview to -20px </p>

"30628860","1","","","2015-06-03 19:23:42","","0","34","<p>I'm trying to implement an ordering algorithm based on dates of events in a data frame.  The dates are strings of the form <code>07/10/1989 07:59</code> and I went through a process of extracting their numeric values and eventually got an array with 5 columns with rows of the form <code>7 10 89 7 59</code>.  </p>

<p>Here's the problem: I'm trying to sort the original data frame using this array of numeric values with for loops and if statements:</p>

<pre><code> for (i in 1:(L-1)){
  for (j in (i+1):L){
    if (Dates_Num[i,3] &gt; Dates_Num[j,3]) {
      a    &lt;- V[i]
      V[i] &lt;- V[j]
      V[j] &lt;- a
    }
    else if(match(Dates_Num[i,3], Dates_Num[j,3], nomatch = F) == 1) {
      if (Dates_Num[i,1] &gt; Dates_Num[j,1]) {
        a    &lt;- V[i]
        V[i] &lt;- V[j]
        V[j] &lt;- a ...
</code></pre>

<p>and there are more nestings of exactly the same form.  The algorithm executes, and there's no loss of information, but it doesn't order the data frame by dates.  For reference <code>Dates_Num</code> is my 5-column array of numeric dates, and initially <code>V = 1:L</code> where <code>L</code> is the number of rows in the data frame.  I've tried on simple toy examples that if I give <code>V</code> the right permutation then <code>Dates_Num[V,]</code> should hopefully have the correct permutation, and same with the data frame.  What am I doing wrong?  Is there some kind of syntax I got wrong?</p>

<p>I have a loop which returns in every step, a matrix <code>b</code>. 
I would like to save each matrix from each loop, under a different name depending on the iteration number. For example, at the end of the first iteration, I want to get the matrix named <code>b1</code>, at the end of the second iteration the <code>b2</code> etc...</p>

<p>As an example, lets use the following code:</p>

<pre><code>count=0
a=matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12), nrow=6)
for (count in 1:10)  {
  b&lt;-cbind(a[,1],matrix(c( a[sample(nrow(a)),2]), nrow=nrow(a)) ) 
  print(b)
}
count+1
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the original matrix is <code>matrix a</code> which has <code>6</code> rows and <code>2</code> columns.
I permute the order of the elements in the second column. The resulting <code>matrix b</code>, is the matrix that conatins as first column the first column of the original <code>matrix a</code> and as second column the permuted second column of <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me? </p>

<p>What i am trying to do, is fetching a list of users from the ""users"" table in my database. I call the method like this:</p>

<pre><code>$members = $this-&gt;con-&gt;getAllMembers();
</code></pre>

<p>my getAllMembers() looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>function getAllMembers(){
        $stmt = $this-&gt;con-&gt;prepare(""SELECT users.username, profileinfo.joindate FROM users 
                                    LEFT JOIN profileinfo ON users.user_id = profileinfo.userID"");
        $stmt-&gt;execute();
        $stmt-&gt;bind_result($username, $joindate);

        $members = array ();
        while($stmt-&gt;fetch()){
            $user = new User();
            $user-&gt;username = $username;
            $user-&gt;joindate = $joindate;
            array_push($members, $user);
        }
        $stmt-&gt;close();

        return $members;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And then I try to echo out a list like this (shortened down):</p>

<pre><code>foreach($members as $member){
        $joindate = date('j. M-o',$member-&gt;joindate);
        echo ""  &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href='"".MAINPATH.""profile/"".$member-&gt;username.""'&gt;$member-&gt;username&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;$joindate&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;"";
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The weird thing is that it works like it should on my localhost (Windows machine running apache server through XAMPP)
But when I run it on the Linux server, it stops completely after the getAllMembers() method is called. I can't even echo out a single value after it is called. I can fetch single values, insert and update on the Linux server, but the above just doesn't work for some reason.</p>

<p>I really hope someone can help me out here.</p>

<p>The Linux server runs: PHP Version 5.5.9-1ubuntu4.4
And my local apache server runs PHP Version 5.5.15, if that is relevant at all.</p>

The problem arises when querying the values of custom fields across different screen schemes/issue types. For example, using the following JQL statement fails to trigger a notification:</p>

<p>project=""Demo"" AND ""Field1"" = ""foo"" AND ""Field2"" = ""bar""</p>

<p>Where custom fields ""Field1"" and ""Field2"" are assigned to separate screens, but exist within the same project. Both custom field values are currently ""foo"" and ""bar"" respectively, so I expect the statement to evaluate to TRUE.</p>

<p>Using this statement, filtering issues using JIRA’s advanced searching feature does not return an issue when the AND keyword is used to query field values across different screen schemes/issue types. This is expected, since JIRA is attempting to return an issue(s) where both conditions are met, and since the condition evaluates as TRUE for separate issues, this fails to return an issue. I was still expecting a trigger to be generated however, when using this statement in Notification Assistant</p>

<p>For generating a notification, I need to use a statement that will only return TRUE when both conditions are met. Is there another JQL statement that could be used to return TRUE when checking these custom field values? Is there a way this can be done using Script Runner or another add-on?</p>

Then, when a user clicks on an item from the list, it queries the server to return <strong>all</strong> of the item information, including some SVG data.</p>

<pre><code>function ItemsCtrl($scope, $http) {
  $scope.items = [];
  $scope.selectedItemDesign = null;

  $http.jsonp('/items/all?callback=JSON_CALLBACK').
    success(function (data) {
      $scope.items = data;
    });

  $scope.getItem = function (item) {
    var index = $scope.items.indexOf(item);
    if (!$scope.items[index].SVG) {
      $http.jsonp('/items/byid/' + $scope.items[index]._id + '?callback=JSON_CALLBACK').
        success(function (data) {
          $scope.items[index].SVG = data.SVG;

        });
    } else {
      $scope.selectedItemDesign = $scope.items[index].SVG;
    }
  };
}
</code></pre>

<p>The SVG data is then bound directly to the view via:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""span9"" ng-bind-html-unsafe=""selectedItemDesign""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I have is that I want to be able to attach events to tags in the SVG so as to allow users to interact with the SVG (simple onClick events), but I can't figure out how to do this...</p>

<p>I thought that after the line; <code>$scope.selectedItem = $scope.items[index];</code> I would then be able to access the DOM and attach the events, but that isn't the case (the DOM hasn't been updated yet). I've looked at the information on directives too and while I've managed to get a directive set up to do the operations I need, it doesn't fire when the SVG is changed (and even then I'm not sure if it's pre/post DOM update).</p>

  $http.post('/api/files/download', {uri: uri}).then(function(response) {

<p>The headers are ok (i can retrieve the file name)</p>

<p>My issue is that a file is downloaded but with a size of 1.5Mb and is unreadable. I tried different methods with streams, append data to response, pipe, etc. without success.
Another point (not sure is important) : within Safari the files is opened with a broken icon displayed, within Chrome the file is saved</p>

<p>PS : i created the project with Yeoman if the information is useful</p>

<p>Thanks all</p>

New version of server function (still not working)</p>

The double sized file contains extra ""efbffd"" char sequence randomly in the file making it unreadable</p>

<p>I am planing to use <strong>Auto-Renewable Subscriptions</strong> in the app and they are renewing on monhly basis as we are updating the contents(Audio clips) of the channel frequently.</p>

<p>I was going through the Apple policy for auto renwing subscription which is,</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>Auto-renewable subscriptions allow users to purchase dynamic content, such as magazine subscriptions, for a set duration of time. Subscriptions renew automatically unless the user opts out of the renewal. If the content you want offer doesn’t fit what’s outlined in the App Review Guidelines, consider offering the content through a non-renewing subscription.
Auto-renewable subscriptions can include an incentive to customers who share their contact information with you.</p>

<p><strong>Review Guideline</strong></p>

<p>11.15. Apps may only use auto-renewing subscriptions for periodicals (newspapers, magazines), business Apps (enterprise, productivity, professional creative, cloud storage), and media Apps (video, audio, voice), or the App will be rejected</p>

<p>Its very confusing which method to use in my app (Auto-Renewing or Non-Renewing)
hense there are different types of thoughts/information shared on the internet.</p>

<p>So, my question is which method is appropriate to my app? </p>

<p>Can my product will get approval or not if I stick to use Auto-Renewable Subscriptions?</p>

<p>Further, if theres any complete tutorial/sample app for auto-renewable subscriptions please share with me.</p>

"4589635","1","","","2011-01-04 00:24:24","","12","4462","<p>I'm working on a medium sized ASP.NET MVC solution with Visual Studio 2010 and Resharper. The project was blazing fast when I started developing it 1 1/2 years ago, but over time it has become slower - not only compilation, but also the time it takes ASP.NET to re-initialize the website. Since I am practicing TDD and refactoring quite often, I frequently need to recompile an re-run my tests, so I am looking for ways to mitigate this if any possible.</p>

<p><strong>The problem in detail</strong></p>

<p>It takes me about 20-25 seconds from starting to recompile the project to being able to view the result in a web browser. </p>

<p>Running a single unit test (just a single test, not the entire suite) with the Resharper test runner is also very slow (about 15-20 seconds). For some weird reason it seems that Resharper takes most of the time initializing the test run and spends only a very small fraction actually running the test. </p>

<p><strong>What I've already done:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Replaced my hard drive with an SSD (huge impact)</li>
<li>Moved ASP.NET's compilation and the Windows Temp directory dir to SSD-like (hardware) RAM drive (big impact, but that was before SSD)</li>
<li>Disabled automatic compilation of one project I rarely modify (Small impact since that project is small anyway). </li>
<li>Weeded out unnecessary references to .NET and third party libraries (very small impact, if any)</li>
<li>Some black magic tricks discussed in <a href=""http://blog.lavablast.com/post/2010/12/01/Slash-your-ASPNET-compileload-time.aspx"">this blog post</a>. (very small impact, if any). </li>
</ul>

<p>Yet I am still stuck with the (slow?) figures above and I feel that this is harming my productivity. Now I am wondering what do do next. </p>

<p><strong>My current system setup:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Core 2 Quad Q6600 CPU  </li>
<li>4GB DDR2 800 RAM</li>
<li>120 GB SSD</li>
<li>Windows 7 x64</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate with Resharper 5.5</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My solution's specs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>22.000 Lines of .NET 4 C# Code </li>
<li>3 projects: One ASP.NET MVC, one test project , one tiny general purpose library is included by the other two and which I do not compile unless something changed.</li>
<li>35 references to other libraries (.NET framework and open source stuff)</li>
<li>~200 Views</li>
<li>850 Unit Tests</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Now my questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Would upgrading my RAM to 8GB could give me a significant performance boost?</li>
<li>Are these figures normal? Or perhaps this could be a problem with my solution?</li>
<li>What would you try next (apart from buying an entirely new computer)? </li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Adrian</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> One particularly weird thing is that when I hit the ""build solution"" button, Visual Studio spends about 8 seconds showing me a waiting symbol until it actually starts compiling and the compilation window is being updated. The IDE is unrespsonsive during this period. Thats a good portion of the actual compilation time. I wonder what Visual Studio is doing during this period?</p>

<p>The users of my classes will be people who are new to the language. However, there are some objects that might be referenced in several parts of their programs. Since I don't expect them to do the memory management, I'd like to do it myself. Therefore, I have to implement reference counting (garbage collection is not a possibility).</p>

<p>I want to make that reference counting as transparent as possible, for example...</p>

<pre><code>// Define a Bézier curve
CVecList pts;
pts.Add(Vector(0,0,0));
pts.Add(Vector(0,0,100));
pts.Add(Vector(0,100,0));
pts.Add(Vector(0,100,100));
CCurve* c1 = new CBezier(pts);

// Define a 3rd order B-Spline curve
pts.Clear();
pts.Add(Vector(0,0,0));
pts.Add(Vector(0,200,100));
pts.Add(Vector(0,200,200));
pts.Add(Vector(0,-200,100));
pts.Add(Vector(0,-200,200));
pts.Add(Vector(0,0,0));
CCurve* c2 = new CBSpline(pts,3);

// The Bézier curve object must be deleted automatically
// because the only reference to it has been released
// Similar to IUnknown::Release() in COM
c1 = c2;
</code></pre>

<p>Things get a little bit more tricky when I define surface objects, because some surfaces are defined in terms of two curves:</p>

<pre><code>CVecList pts;
// ...
CCurve* f = new CBezier(pts);

pts.Clear();
// ...
CCurve* g = new CBezier(pts);

// Mixed surface: S(u,v) = (1-v)*f(u) + v*g(u)
CSurface* s = new CMixed(f,g);

// There are two references to the first Bézier curve,
// the first one is f
// the second one is hidden in a member of CMixed

// Something similar applies to the second Bézier curve
</code></pre>

<p>I thought that overriding <code>operator =</code> for pointers could have helped:</p>

<pre><code>// This is what I tried, but it's illegal:
typedef CReferenceCounted* PRC;
PRC&amp; operator =(PRC&amp; dest, PRC&amp; source)
{
    if (source)
        source-&gt;AddRef();
    if (dest)
        dest-&gt;Release();
    memcpy(&amp;dest,&amp;source,sizeof(PRC));
    return dest;
}
</code></pre>

<p>... but then I found that <code>operator =</code> is not valid unless it is as a non-static member of a class.</p>

<p>Could anybody possible help me?</p>

<p>I have a database table where each row represents a file type. I want to make a process where the site configuration is dynamic enough to handle and assimilate changes to its configuration based on changes to this table.</p>

<p>Currently I have a collection of entries in a configsection in my web.config file which represents a collection of file types. So maybe I'd have something like <code>&lt;add key=""Pdf""&gt;</code> in a filetypes section if I want to be working with PDF files.</p>

<p>Each of these keys has an entry in my database, and I'm using an enum to map a friendly name/CLR object to the database value (integer). I like the way that I can then use this easily in a tag attribute e.g. <code>&lt;cc1:MyControl FileType=""Pdf""&gt;</code>, and I can use a combination of database data and additional attributes from web.config to allow Intellisense to really do its thing.</p>

<p>Problem is, this enum is hard-coded currently and I don't know a good way to make this dynamic to handle future additions or deletions. As it stands, if I want to add a new file type I'd have to add a new row to the database, add an entry for it in the web.config, and then update the enum with the new ID. That's okay for me, but it's a bit manual and also I can't speak for the ability of our support to follow that procedure.</p>

<p>I think what is causing a roadblock conceptually for me is the fact that instead of translating DB schema to CLR schema, I'm actually trying to convert a conglomeration of instances of a schema object to one type.</p>

<p>I am using entity framework so leveraging something in there is not a problem.</p>

<p>I was considering using xsd.exe, but as I'm not keen on scheduling it to run or calling it to refresh the schema, having fellow devs go through that process is probably more unwieldy than just updating the enum manually. However if there's something I can do that route I am more than willing to check it out.</p>

<p>To clarify, I'm not really hung up on having this in web.config, this is just how I did it to get it to work nice and pretty-like in a hardcoded fashion.</p>

<p>Ideally, what I'd like to do is to have data that originates from the database auto-magically parsed and/or recognized, where I can just put its name or representation in plain English in a tag property. I'm thinking this is most likely going to look like some xml schema file that the client references.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestion, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks guys.</p>

<p>This works correctly on my machine from the Package Manager Console. However I would like to use a relative path for the file so that the entire development team can use this easily. </p>

<p>When I simply wrote the file name the update failed. When I tried concatenating the current directory to the file name I saw that the current directory was c:\windows\system32.</p>

<p>How can I make the update run from the project or solution directory? </p>

<p>Alternatively, is there a better way to fill the table during an update? I don't want to use the <code>Seed</code> method becasue it doesn't do exactly what I want. For instance, there's only a single <code>Seed</code> method while I want to write different code for different migrations.</p>

<li>Normal items have a foreground text color of black and background color of white  </li>
<li>Selected items have a foreground text color of white and a background color of dark blue  </li>
<li>On mouse-over the background becomes a orangish and the foreground text color is black</li>
</ol>

<p>I have each of those pieces working individually but can't get them all working together. I started by retemplating the ListBoxItem, wrapping the ContentPresenter in a ContentControl and using Visual States to change the foreground and backgrounds for selected and mouseover states. But the selected and mouseover states can both apply simultaneously, which causes problems when you mouseover a selected item and then mouse out. The recommendation is to avoid changing a single property in states that are in different state groups. So I wrapped another ContentControl around the first content control, and tried changing the the parent ContentControl's foreground in one visual state and the child ContentControl's foreground in the other visual state. But it looks like ContentControl's don't inherit the foreground property from their parent, so that doesn't seem to work (even if I retemplate the ContentControl to remove the explicit foreground property setter).</p>

<p>So I'm a bit stuck - don't know what to try next. Here's the XAML from my most recent iteration</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Style x:Key=""SimpleListBoxItem"" TargetType=""ListBoxItem""&gt;

<blockquote>
  <p>The following procedure describes how to register for notifications.</p>
  
  <p>1.Get an IConnectionPointContainer interface by calling QueryInterface on an IMbnInterfaceManager > object.<br>
  2.Call FindConnectionPoint on the returned interface and pass IID_IMbnPinEvents to riid.<br>

  <p>Notifications can be terminated by calling Unadvise on the connection point returned in step 2.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have got some code that carries out the first 3 steps, and it successfully registers for MBN events.
However, now I need to de-register temporarily from receiving these events.<br>
So, after a couple of first attempts that ended with COM exceptions, I tried the following code (with try/catch blocks):</p>

<pre><code>//First get the notifications

public void RegisterEvent(object iUnk, Guid guid, out uint storedTag)
{
IConnectionPoint icp = null;
Guid curGuid = guid;
storedTag = 0;
if ((curGuid == typeof(IMbnInterfaceManagerEvents).GUID) )              
{
  // For this event, the connection point is defined on the interface manager object
  m_InterfaceManagerCPC.FindConnectionPoint(ref curGuid, out icp);
  // Call Advise on the connection point to register
  icp.Advise(iUnk, out storedTag);
  //Save the IConnectionPoint object
  interfaceManagerCP = icp;

}

//Now deregister the events

public void DeregisterEvent(Guid guid, uint storedTag)
{
IConnectionPoint icp = null;
Guid curGuid = guid;

// Find the appropriate connection point to call Unadvise on
if ((curGuid == typeof(IMbnInterfaceManagerEvents).GUID) )              
{
  // Call Unadvise on the saved connection point to de-register
  interfaceManagerCP.Unadvise(storedTag);
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I run this code, I get no errors or exceptions from MBN.  But the event handlers aren't de-registered.  I can still see in the log files, MBN events arriving and being handled.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what I am missing? Thank you.</p>

Boost's archive scheme is based on symmetrical input and output archive classes.  It's tedious to write about both of them all the time, so I'll use <code>?archive</code> to mean both <code>oarchive</code> and <code>iarchive</code>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
After changing the base classes of my custom archives from <code>binary_?archive_impl</code> to <code>text_?archive_impl</code>, my custom archive classes are no longer ""found"" when the compiler is instantiating the <code>serialize(...)</code> methods in my other classes.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br>
My application was successfully reading and writing files to disk using subclasses of <code>binary_?archive_impl</code> (the documentation and/or code comments recommend this over deriving from <code>binary_?archive</code>).  I needed to switch from a binary file format to a text format, so I switched the base classes of my custom archives to <code>text_?archive_impl</code>.  That's when everything blew up.</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong><br>
My custom archive classes add functionality, including some additional methods which do not exist in their Boost base classes; these methods are called in the <code>serialize(...)</code> methods in many of my classes, and <em>they were working fine</em>.  After changing the base classes from <code>binary_?archive_impl</code> to <code>text_?archive_impl</code>, I received compilation errors all over the place complaining that my custom methods <em>do not exist</em> in <code>text_?archive</code>.  Well, that's obvious (!!!), but they <em>do exist</em> in my <em>custom</em> archives, and they were working <em>just fine</em> when I was using Boost's binary base classes.  What's the deal?</p>

<p><strong>What I found, and my temporary - but undesirable - solution:</strong><br>
After tearing my hair out and going around in circles for about a day, this is what I found...</p>

<p>1) Some time ago (Boost 1.34 I believe), the files ""binary_?archive.hpp"" were split up into ""binary_?archive_impl.hpp"" and ""binary_?archive.hpp"" (the latter #include the former).  This <em>was not</em> done to ""text_?archive.hpp"".  (As a result, I changed my application's #include lines from ""binary_?archive_impl.hpp"" to simply ""text_?archive.hpp"".)</p>

<p>2) If I split up ""text_?archive.hpp"" into two parts and #include only the ""..._impl.hpp"" headers, everything works.  (But I really <em>don't</em> want to modify my Boost installation!)</p>

<p>3) Looking more closely at these headers and fiddling around a bit, I found that if I use the original, unmodified headers and comment out the line</p>

<pre><code>BOOST_SERIALIZATION_REGISTER_ARCHIVE(boost::archive::text_oarchive)
</code></pre>

<p>(and likewise for <code>text_iarchive</code>), then everything works fine again.  (By the way I have similar lines in my own archive code to ""register"" my custom archives.)</p>

<p><strong>The mystery, and my dilemma:</strong><br>
A) Why does the presence of those lines foul up the works?  ...and why does removing them make things work?  ...and what might I have broken (without knowing it) by doing so?</p>

<p>B) Why were the ""text_?archive.hpp"" files <em>not</em> split up along with the ""binary_?archive.hpp"" files a long time ago?  (Is the library broken?  Should it be fixed?)</p>

<p>C) Is there any way to solve this in my application code <em>without</em> modifying my Boost installation?</p>

<p><em>P.S. I'm using Boost 1.48 and Visual Studio 2010 (64-bit)</em><br>
<em>P.P.S. I imagine all of the above would apply equally to <code>text_w?archive</code></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the sum of two operands with opposite signs (or the difference of two operands with like signs) is exactly zero, the sign of that sum (or difference) shall be +0 in all rounding-direction attributes except roundTowardNegative; under that attribute, the sign of an exact zero sum (or difference) shall be −0. However, x + x = x − (−x) retains the same sign as x even when x is zero.</p>

<p>However, in case of CUDA, it looks like compiler is being too aggressive in optimizing away addition of a positive zero in Release builds. Plain C/C++ (or C#/.NET) are working as expected. I’ve looked at PTX code produced by the compiler for different builds, and add.f32 instruction is indeed missing in Release build.</p>

However, they replace the selectbox with an input and a list and then give it a specific class which is used to add your custom styling...</p>

<p>This is fine and dandy, but I need to be able to use multiple sizes. The script is adding the same class to all of the replaced elements, so there's no way that I can find to style them with different widths.</p>

<p>Here's the script I'm talking about: <a href=""http://www.brainfault.com/2008/02/10/new-release-of-jquery-selectbox-replacement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brainfault.com/2008/02/10/new-release-of-jquery-selectbox-replacement</a></p>

<p>I just need to be able to have two distinct sizes/widths of the custom selectboxes. One for numbers such as 1-1000, and another for longer textual names such as ""Transylvania County Home Buyers Association"".</p>

<p>Obviously, one size would look ridiculous if I used the larger size to hold a list of numbers that only goes to 1000, and visa versa.</p>

<p>Any ideas how to make it work?</p>

<p>In basic terms:</p>

<p>The JS file creates a dom element at some point of time after the page has loaded.
I want to append a canvas graphic to that dom element.
That canvas element is triggered by a jQuery plugin, which i call in my sites jQuery script, like so:</p>

<pre><code>Spinners.create('#spinThis');
Spinners.create('#spinThis').play();});
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried to put this bit of code directly in the javascript file via inline ""script"" tags using ""innerHTML"" , but it's not being seen (why actually?)</p>

<p>It's a real conundrum. How do i tell my jQuery file to keep on the look out for an element which will come sooner or later,via another (java) script, and then do something with it?</p>

<p>I would think something like live() would do the trick, but that doesn't make sense, it needs an event and it needs to be associated with the id which isnt even existent yet. <em>Sigh</em></p>

<p>You can see it hear: <a href=""http://syndex.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://syndex.me</a></p>

<p>(In literal terms, the javascript file is a infinite scroll for tumblr (the only one that works) and I'm injecting a spin preloader when it calls for new content in a div that is appended to the end of the content wrapper, you can see it as a pink bar at the end of the posts as it's loading.)</p>

<p>I have enabled highlighting and almost everything works fine - I get the search results and the parts that are highlighted are returned in <code>&lt;lst name=""highlighting""&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is, none of the child nodes that actually contain the highlighted part of text have the name attribute, which is supposed to be the same as the id attribute of the respective result item.</p>

<p>Below is an extract from the result returned from search using the solr admin.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;result name=""response"" numFound=""121"" start=""0"" maxScore=""2.3798883""&gt;

  &lt;/lst&gt;
&lt;/lst&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As can be seen, the id attribute is there for each result. It's just that it is not used in the  nodes.</p>

<p>I am using uuid type for the id which is generated automatically by solr.</p>

<p>Here's part of my schema.xml file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;field name=""id"" type=""uuid"" indexed=""true"" stored=""true"" required=""true"" default=""NEW""/&gt;
&lt;field name=""startTime"" type=""float"" indexed=""true"" stored=""true"" /&gt;
&lt;field name=""Turn"" type=""text_general"" indexed=""true"" stored=""true""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The fieldType uuid is defined in the schema.xml file as below:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;fieldType name=""uuid"" class=""solr.UUIDField"" indexed=""true"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And below is the update processor that generates the id (in solrconfig.xml):</p>

<pre><code> &lt;updateRequestProcessorChain name=""uuid""&gt;
   &lt;processor class=""solr.processor.SignatureUpdateProcessorFactory""&gt;
     &lt;bool name=""enabled""&gt;true&lt;/bool&gt;
     &lt;str name=""signatureField""&gt;id&lt;/str&gt;
     &lt;bool name=""overwriteDupes""&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;
     &lt;str name=""fields""&gt;*&lt;/str&gt;
     &lt;str name=""signatureClass""&gt;solr.processor.Lookup3Signature&lt;/str&gt;
   &lt;/processor&gt;
   &lt;processor class=""solr.LogUpdateProcessorFactory"" /&gt;
   &lt;processor class=""solr.RunUpdateProcessorFactory"" /&gt;
 &lt;/updateRequestProcessorChain&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Without the id as value of the name attribute inside an  item, I won't be able to do further processing, such as replacing text in the result.
I hope this info is enough. Please let me know otherwise. I've been trying to get to the bottom of this for two days now.</p>

<p>The way we work:</p>

<ul>
<li>We try to program in pairs only.
<li>We use Skype and VNC or SharedView to connect and work together.  
<li>In our online Tuesday meeting every week (usually about 1 hour)
<ul>
<li>we talk about the tasks done last week 
<li>we create new pairs for the next week with a random generator so knowledge and friendship distribute evenly
<li>we set the priority for any new tasks or bugs that have come in
<li>each team picks the tasks it likes to do from the highest 
prioritized ones.</li></ul>
<li>From Tuesday to Wednesday we estimate tasks. We have a unit of work we call ""Ideal Developer Session"" (IDS), maybe 2 or 3 hours of working together as a pair. It's not perfectly well defined (because we know estimation always is inaccurate) but from our past shared experience we have a common sense of what an IDS is. If we can't estimate a task because it feels too long for a week we break it down into estimatable smaller tasks.
<li>During a short meeting on Wednesday we commit to a workload we feel is well doable in a week. We commit to complete.
<li>If a team runs out of committed tasks during the week, it can pick new ones from the prioritized queue we have in Jira.
</li>
</ul>

<p>When we started working this way, some of us found that remote pair programming takes a lot of energy because you are so focussed. If you pair program for more than 5 or 6 hours per day, you get drained. On the other hand working like this has turned out to be very efficient. The knowledge about our codebase is evenly distributed and we have really learnt lots from eachother.</p>

<p>I would be very interested to hear about the experiences from other teams working in a similar way. Things like:</p>

<p>How often do you meet?<br>
Have you tried different sprint lengths (one week, two week, longer) ?<br>
Which tools do you use?<br>
Which issue tracker do you use?<br>
What do you do about time zone differences?<br>
How does it work for you to integrate new people into the team?<br>
How many hours do you usually work per week?<br>
How does your management interact with the way you are working?<br>
Do you get put on a waterfall with hard deadlines?<br>
What's your unit of work?<br>
What is your normal velocity?  (units of work done per week)</p>

<p>Programming work should be fun and for us it usually is great fun. </p>

<p>I would be happy about any new ideas how to make it even more fun and/or more efficient.</p>

<p>Now what I have so far is: 4 general classes, an abstract class, an interface and a KeyListener class. (Don't worry it's a very small game at the moment).</p>

<p>Of the 4 general classes, the main class sets up two other classes as objects within it. These two objects are my graphics and my gamestate. Gamestate in turn sets up the last remaining object (player) within it.</p>

<p>The problem I have is that when I initially got it all working so the player could move (via keyPressed) the way input is read from the keyboard meant the player would jerk forward slightly, then run in a continuous motion. This is exactly how if you hold down a letter key on your keyboard a single letter comes up before a string of letters begin to form.</p>

<p>So I thought: ""Oh it's so obvious. I should try and tackle this with booleans so that when a key goes down I have 'boolean right = true'. And I'll have some code somewhere going off in a loop with conditional statements for the moving of the player"".</p>

<p>This is where I am stuck. Because I cannot figure out how to do get into this loop without 'jamming up' my program. In attempts I have run my program and been treated to nothing. The program hangs because it's in the loop and hasn't brought up the swing window yet. I have a feeling the answer is thread related (implements runnable), but I am in such new territory with this that I want 'a right and good' way to do it.</p>

<p>So I suppose this is a very open ended question to a variety of answers. How would you (have you) tackle this kind of problem?</p>

<p>I am extracting a region from Image and I want to store it in array. Therefore, I wanted to create an array of type Mat, where array elements can store the matrix (part of image).</p>

<p>Similarly, I was trying to include a variable k for variable window size and created a 3-D array of type MAT but it didn't work. I dont know whats the problem or how can I use your method?</p>

vector&lt;KeyPoint&gt; vec_keypoints[3][3];
Mat descriptors[3][3];

    for (int i=0;i&lt;3;i++){
        image2(Rect(roiLeft*i,roiTop*j,roiWidth,roiHeight)).copyTo(dst[j][i]);
        detector.detect(dst[j][i],vec_keypoints[j][i]);

    }

Let's have a sqlite3 database and a datetime column in a table named ""daily"".</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)eatQuantity:(NSNumber *)quantity date:(NSDate *)date
{
    User *usr = [User loadCurrentUser];

    BOOL ret;
    sqlite3 *db;

    NSDateFormatter *dateFormatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
    [dateFormatter setDateFormat:@""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss""];
    NSString *strDate = [dateFormatter stringFromDate:date];
    [dateFormatter release];

    NSString *query = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""INSERT INTO daily (id_user, id_food, quantity, date) VALUES (%d, %d, %f, '%@')"", usr.idPk.intValue, self.idPk.intValue, quantity.floatValue, strDate];
    NSLog(@""Query: %@"", query);
</code></pre>

<p>When I call this method passing a NSDate object from a UIDatePicker, some user are facing a strange behavior with NSDate, they log this on their console:</p>

<p>Query: INSERT INTO daily (id_user, id_food, quantity, date) VALUES (1, 1010, 130.000000, '2011-12-21 01:20:09 m.')</p>

<p>But the sqlite3 is unable to store a date is a such format like that with the ending ""m."" string. And users can't view any records because of the null date in the WHERE clause.</p>

<p>So where that ""m."" comes from? What does it mean? How can I fix this issue?</p>

For those who don't know, this app identifies songs by listening to a small segment of the song playing. I was amazed by it's accuracy and speed so I decided to do a little digging.</p>

<p>I found a paper written by one of their developers <a href=""http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. In the paper the developer goes into a good amount of detail describing the fingerprintng algorithm used in Shazam.</p>

<p>As a pet project Id like to make my own song fingerprinting application so I can get some experience with audio programming. </p>

<p>What are some audio libraries that help you extract things like frequency, amplitude, and other characteristics of an audio clip or mp3 song over it's duration?</p>

<p>I'm using .NET but I'm open to other languages libraries. I'm also fine with both open source and paid libraries. As long as I can reliabably extract audio characteristics progmatically I'll be happy.</p>

<p>For example, a simple messagebox accepts the caption but will only produce the default argument (vbOKCancel).  In some circumstances I would prefer to use vbYesNo but if I enter <code>MsgBox(""Do you wish to cancel"",vbYesNo)</code> then although the various alternative responses drop down for selection, I get <code>""Expected: =""</code> on trying to complete the statement. This happens whenever I try to use arguments - for example if I use DoCmd in the OnCurrent event of the Form object to display a particular record.</p>

<p>Example code:</p>

<pre><code>'If closed without a preference being selected, continue:
    If IsNull(cboPreference) Then
        MsgBox (""You have not selected a preference.  Do you want to cancel?"",vbYesNo)

<p>How can I map a JSON name to a Java class' field name that might be (slightly) different when using the Jackson parser?</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>I have incoming JSON documents I would like to convert to a Java object using the <a href=""http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonInFiveMinutes"" rel=""nofollow"">Jackson parser</a>. This works well for where the JSON names match the eventual Java object field names (I am doing this within the Play Framework). </p>

<p>However some JSON names in the incoming JSON document do not lend themselves to nice Java field names. Changing all the existing JSON documents to use proper Java naming conventions is currently not feasible.</p>

<p>For example</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""goodName"": ""value"",
  ""not-so-handy"": ""value""
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can't create a Java class with a field name of ""not-so-handy"" since that is not a legal name in Java. </p>

                         SUM(CASE WHEN col2 = 2 THEN col3 ELSE 0 END) AS TotaleB,
                          (...)
       from tabella
       group by col1, col2)
    select col1, TotaleA, TotaleB
    from T
    group by col1, TotaleA, TotaleB
</code></pre>

<p>And the solution is to do without col2 in the grouping... I was afraid getting ""invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause"", but it's not.. Can I mark a comment as the correct answer?</p>

<p>Rabl docs have written following rabl for it(which does not make sense to me) :</p>

<pre><code># app/views/posts/index.rabl
collection @posts
attributes :id, :title, :subject
child(:user) { attributes :full_name }

<pre><code>job = SSHJobMan(hostlist, cmd)
job.start()
while not job.done():
    for each in job.poll():
        incrementally_process(job.results[each])
        time.sleep(0.2) # or other more useful work
post_process(job.results)
</code></pre>

<p>An alernative usage model is:</p>

<pre><code>job = SSHJobMan(hostlist, cmd)
job.wait()  # implicitly performs a start()
process(job.results)
</code></pre>

<p>This all works fine for the current utility.  However it does lack flexibility.  For example I currently support a brief output format or a progress bar as incremental results, I also support
brief, complete and ""merged message"" outputs for the <code>post_process()</code> function.</p>

<p>However, I'd like to support multiple results/output streams (progress bar to the terminal, debugging and warnings to a log file, outputs from successful jobs to one file/directory, error messages and other results from non-successful jobs to another, etc).</p>

<p>This sounds like a situation that calls for Observer ... have instances of my class accept registration from other objects and call them back with specific types of events as they occur.</p>

<p>I'm looking at <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyPubSub/"">PyPubSub</a> since I saw several references to that in SO related questions.  I'm not sure I'm ready to add the external dependency to my utility but I could see value in using their interface as a model for mine if that's going to make it easier for others to use.  (The project is intended as both a standalone command line utility and a class for writing other scripts/utilities).</p>

<p>In short I know how to do what I want ... but there are numerous ways to accomplish it.  I want suggestions on what's most likely to work for other users of the code in the long run.</p>

<p>once again if a user clicks on ""cottage"" aka an item in the list mailItems.addressFilters
than the data mailItems.addressFilters.friendly_name should be displayed in ""mailbox_name""
mailItems.addressFilters.Formatted_Address should be displayed in ""mailbox_addr_1"" and mailItems.addressFilters.Formatted_Address2 should be displayed in ""mailbox_addr_2"".</p>

<p>the current hyperlink params are the same... that is ""addressTypeF=1"" for home... ""addressTypeF=2"" for Personal Inbox and ""addressTypeF=3"" for the list items of mailItems.addressFilters</p>

<p>I basically need a way to answer this question: When I add this column or index, is it going to lock the table for 1 minute, 10 minutes or and hour+. The reason being we need to know if this is implementation is going to require us to notify clients of a break in service or if we can do it at off peak hours.</p>

<p>I realize there are a lot of factors involved in a question like this but, I'd like to focus in on the ones that aren't obvious such as machine performance, current system load etc.</p>

<p>Ideally a formal of some sort like:</p>

<p><code>(Number of Rows) * (0.01 Secs) * (Some unknown factors) = 112.secs</code></p>

<p>Also is there a substantial difference between adding an index an a column? 
What about different types of columns that are added?</p>

My issue is that when I scroll my canvas, my onTouch methods no longer receive coordinates that are relative to the canvas. This screws up my collision detection system. So I need an appropriate offset as seen below:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent e) {    
    int scaledX = (int) e.getX() + xOffset;
    int scaledY = (int) e.getY();
    return playState.onTouch(e, scaledX, scaledY);

<p>What would be an appropriate offset value? I've already experimented with setting up a dXSum value as my offset where dXSum is calculated as follows:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
        public boolean onScroll(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float distanceX, float distanceY) {
            dX = distanceX;
            dXSum += distanceX;
            return true;
        }

<p>However this isn't working well for me. I used System.out.println(dXSum) in onTouch to print its value to the console every time I touch the screen. Through this I noticed that when I scroll far to the right and then scroll back to the origin, dXSum is a high positive number rather than zero and when I scroll far to the left and then back, it's a high negative number rather than zero. Any idea what I'm doing wrong? Is there any better offset methods?</p>

            numDates = 3
        Else

        Dim dates = (From data In ctx.tsintracharts

                     Select data.Date).Distinct().ToList()

        'Dim datelist As IQueryable(Of Date) = dates.OrderByDescending(Function(o) o).Take(numDates)
        Return dates
    End Function
</code></pre>

<p>No ordering occurs, the whole list of dates is returned</p>

<p>I've ordered by date before, both using the function syntax and by putting OrderBy before the Select in the linq statement. I am simply trying to return the latest three dates in the distinct list of dates.</p>

<p>However, if I move the Order By into the LINQ statement no ordering occurs</p>

<pre><code>  Dim dates = (From data In ctx.tsintracharts
                    Where data.Symbol = symbol
                    Order By data.Date Descending
                    Select data.Date
                    ).Distinct()
</code></pre>

<p>and returning dates.Take(numDates) does in fact return only three dates. The problem is they are always the oldest and I need the latest.</p>

<p>I can't make heads or tails of some of the behavior of the commands. Here is an example using ECHO. The thing appears to just randomly return one of: the variable I defined, the variable name, or an error. </p>

<p>e.g. why does:<br>
<code>$ _Src=""/home/axxxxxx""</code><br>
<code>$ echo ""${_Src}""</code>  </p>

<p>return<br>
<code>/home/axxxxxx</code>  </p>

<p>but<br>
<code>$ INFA_HOME=""/home""</code><br>
<code>$ echo ""${INFA_HOME}""</code>  </p>

<p>returns<br>
<code>ksh: ""${INFA_HOME_^H}"": bad substitution</code>  </p>

<p>other inscrutable behavior:<br>
<code>$ echo ""${INFA_HOME} now""</code><br>
<code>&gt;</code><br>
<code>$ echo ""${INFA_HOME} now""</code><br>
<code>/home now</code><br>
<code>$ echo ""${INFA_HOME} ""</code><br>

The topic I am currently at is Z-buffer. Aside from explaining what's it all about, the author mentions that we can perform custom depth tests, such as GL_LESS, GL_ALWAYS, etc. He also explains that the actual meaning of depth values (which is top and which isn't) can also be customized. I understand so far. And <a href=""http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/Positioning/Tut05%20Overlap%20and%20Depth%20Buffering.html"">then</a> the author says something unbelievable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The range zNear can be greater than the range zFar; if it is, then the
  window-space values will be reversed, in terms of what constitutes
  closest or farthest from the viewer.</p>
  
  <p>Earlier, it was said that the window-space Z value of 0 is closest and
  1 is farthest. However, if our clip-space Z values were negated, the
  depth of 1 would be closest to the view and the depth of 0 would be
  farthest. Yet, if we flip the direction of the depth test (GL_LESS to
  GL_GREATER, etc), we get the exact same result. So it's really just a
  convention. <strong><em>Indeed, flipping the sign of Z and the depth test was once
  a vital performance optimization for many games.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I understand correctly, performance-wise, flipping the sign of Z and the depth test is nothing but changing a <code>&lt;</code> comparison to a <code>&gt;</code> comparison. So, if I understand correctly and the author isn't lying or making things up, then changing <code>&lt;</code> to <code>&gt;</code> used to be <strong><em>a vital optimization</em></strong> for many games.</p>

<p>Is the author making things up, am I misunderstanding something, or is it indeed the case that once <code>&lt;</code> was slower (<em>vitally</em>, as the author says) than <code>&gt;</code>?</p>

<p>Thanks for clarifying this quite curious matter!</p>

<p><sub>Disclaimer: I am fully aware that algorithm complexity is the primary source for optimizations. Furthermore, I suspect that nowadays it definitely wouldn't make any difference and I am not asking this to optimize anything. I am just extremely, painfully, maybe prohibitively curious.</sub></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vectors are relatively efficient adding or removing elements from its
  end. For operations that involve inserting or removing elements at
  positions other than the end, they perform worse than the others, and
  have less consistent iterators and references than lists and
  forward_lists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, in 'complexity' of 'erase' method of vector I found next:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Linear on the number of elements erased (destructions) plus the number
  of elements after the last element deleted (moving).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 'complexity' of 'erase' method of list next:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Linear in the number of elements erased (destructions).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But when I tested it in the 30 millions elements in each container (I deleted from 24357 element to 2746591 element), I got that deleting from vector took 5 ms, but from list 8857 ms. Difference is huge and confusing...</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""stdafx.h""
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;list&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;

using namespace std;

{
    const long int x = 30000000;
    vector&lt;char&gt; v;
    vector&lt;char&gt;::iterator itv1, itv2;
    list&lt;char&gt; l;
    list&lt;char&gt;::iterator itl1, itl2;
    unsigned start, end;

    long int first, last;

    cout &lt;&lt; ""Please enter first position: \n"";
    cin &gt;&gt; first;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Please enter last position: \n"";
    cin &gt;&gt; last;

    for (long int i = 0; i &lt; x; ++i)    {
        char c;
        c = (rand() % 26) + 'a';
        v.push_back(c);
        l.push_back(c);
    }

    cout &lt;&lt; ""Starting deletion\n"";
    start = clock();
    itv1 = v.begin() + first;
    itv2 = v.begin() + last;
    v.erase(itv1, itv2);
    end = clock();
    cout &lt;&lt; ""End "" &lt;&lt; end-start &lt;&lt; ""\n"";

    start = clock();
    itl1 = itl2 = l.begin();

    end = clock();
    cout &lt;&lt; ""End "" &lt;&lt; end-start &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
    return 0;
}

<p>Could you explain - what causes such difference? My opinion - moving iterators in list much slower than in vectors - but I don't sure. </p>

<pre><code>try

<p>My question is will the compiler completely optimize this out?  When I look at the compiled assembly in Reflector, it shows this:</p>

<pre><code>try
{
    i = this.strOriginalData.IndexOf(""\r\n"");
}
catch (Exception exception1)
{
    ex = exception1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The declaration for i has been moved to the top of the method, and additional declaration of type Exception is at the top of the method also.</p>

<p>So, since this code doesn't really do anything, I was wondering if the compiler is smart enough to see that this code does nothing and can optimize it out.</p>

<p>I don’t want the element to be required in order for the form to validate.  However, if a date is not inputted, form validation gives the error <code>The input does not appear to be a valid date</code>.</p>

<p>Also, the format <code>'n/j/y'</code> renders the null value as <code>11/30/-1</code>.  If <code>0</code> is entered in the input, form validation gives the error <code>The input does not appear to be a valid date</code> and if something like <code>0/0/00</code> is entered, validation gives both <code>The input does not appear to be a valid date</code> and <code>The input does not fit the date format 'n/j/y'</code>.</p>

<p>Is there a way to get the validator to accept a null date value or to skip validation for inputs that are not changed?</p>

<p><code>allow_empty</code> doesn’t work.  I’ve set it and also set <code>'required' -&gt; false</code>.  I even checked to make sure that the validation attributes were being passed all of the way to the controller and the view by echoing all of the errors and attributes.  The following code:</p>

<pre><code>// enumerate message
$messages = $form-&gt;getMessages();
if($messages) {
  echo ""&lt;h4&gt;error messages:&lt;/h4&gt;"";
  print_r ($messages);
}
echo ""&lt;br/&gt;"";
echo ""allow_empty: "" . $memberBirthDate-&gt;getAttribute('allow_empty') . ""&lt;br/&gt;"";
echo ""required: "" . $memberBirthDate-&gt;getAttribute('required') . ""&lt;br/&gt;"";
</code></pre>

<p>produces:</p>

<pre><code>Array ( [member-fieldset] =&gt; Array ( [memberBirthDate] =&gt; Array ( [isEmpty] =&gt; Value is required and can't be empty ) ) ) 
allow_empty: 1
required:
</code></pre>

<h2>EDIT 2</h2>

<p>I do have a filter specified in the fieldset.  This part of my project follows the format presented <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/manual/current/en/modules/zend.form.collections.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://framework.zend.com/manual/current/en/modules/zend.form.collections.html</a>, which doesn’t suggest anything about using a factory.

Currently I am loading an SVG file into an HTML file and then loading that into a UIWebview. I presume that you would use Javascript to do this but am not sure how the go about it exactly. Ideally I would like to be able to manipulate the SVG on the fly in an iPad app. I am aware that you can 'inject' code into the UIWebview but have had no success with my attempts. Clear as mud? Well perhaps a bit of code will help.</p>

<p>Here is how I load the html file into the UIWebview inside the view controller .m file:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad 
{
    [super viewDidLoad];

    NSString*  path    = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""SVG"" ofType:@""html""];
    NSString*  content = [NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:path encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:nil];

    webView = [UIWebView new];
    webView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 1024, 768);
    webView.dataDetectorTypes = UIDataDetectorTypeAll;
    webView.userInteractionEnabled = YES;
    [webView loadHTMLString:content baseURL:[[NSBundle mainBundle] bundleURL]];

    [self.view addSubview:webView];
    [webView release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code inside the html file that is loaded into the UIWebview:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;SVG&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;object id=""circle"" data=""Circle.svg"" width=""250"" height=""250"" type=""image/svg+xml""/&gt; 
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>...and finally here is the code inside the SVG file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;svg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""&gt;
&lt;circle id=""redcircle"" cx=""200"" cy=""50"" r=""50"" fill=""red"" /&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which creates a nice little red circle in the UIWebview. Now I would like to be able to manipulate the circle on the fly back in the view controller .m file. For example when the user touches the iPad screen, change the fill color attribute to green. Is this even possible?</p>

<p>I hope this all makes sense. It's a bit convoluted. But ultimately what I am trying to do is create graphics on the fly with SVG in an HTML framework and display it in a UIWebview.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.  </p>

<p>Apparently,in some devices after a system update, the toasts are not shown. The problem happens when in preferences, for your application the notifications checkbox is unchecked. Due to that your all the toasts of your app will be hidden. 
This happened to me on a Samsung galaxy tab 2 but it can happen on other devices:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12056097/toast-notifications-not-showing-up-on-nexus-7-tablet"">Toast Notifications Not Showing Up on Nexus 7 Tablet</a></p>

<p>or on SGS3 as commented on the google group link. </p>

<p>I don't know if this happens on all devices with jelly bean or not. </p>

<p>The suggested ""fixes"" are fine for me but what if my app is downloaded by some people who don't know how to do that or don't want to activate notifications. I rely on toasts a lot in the app to inform the user about some feedback so I only see one solution to this:
->IMPLEMENT MY OWN TOAST CLASS, different from toast but with similar behaviour.</p>

<p>I have searched around I haven't found anything out there already done so I am asking if anyone has found any custom implementations (before I start coding it myself)???</p>

<p>The objective is: show a toast or some replacement for it even if notifications are turned off for this app.</p>

<p>Thank you very much in advance</p>

However every time I call FileReference.Download, I get File I/O Error 2038.  Is this because it's trying to download from a test ""local server"", as the url is something along the lines of <code>http://localhost:4313/C:/temp/Name.pdf</code>?  Every solution I've seen for this particular error is an issue with scope, however I declared my FileReference variable as a class variable as opposed to a function variable, so that shouldn't be the issue I think.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I found an example of using FileReference.download online and replaced the url I was getting with the one in the example, and the download worked, so it seems my issue is with the generation of the download URL.  I create the URL on the server after creating the file for download then pass it back to the flex client.  To create the URL I'm using <code>return HttpContext.Current.Request.Url.GetLeftPart(UriPartial.Authority) + HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppVirtualPath + filePath;</code>, the filePath variable being the physical location where the file is created, returning me <code>http://localhost:4313/C:/temp/Name.pdf</code>.

The app has a fixed header and footer, and the contents of the page is scrollable ( sometimes it's larger than the screen ).</p>

<p>When I'm focused on an input field of the form and dismiss it by clicking outside of it, the header of the app moves next to the clicking position and drops its ""fix"" to the top.</p>

<p>This issue occures only under iOS.</p>

<p>I cannot take screenshots to show the problem, but I have (poorly) illustrated it:</p>

<ol>
<li>The way the page looks normally:<br />
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zMa4j.png"" alt=""enter image description here""><br /><br /></li>
<li><p>When I click on a specific text field (it's actually a number text field), the keyboard opens up:<br /><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/UCYfZ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""><br />
I can scroll the content up and down even when the keyboard is open, until I reach the header or the footer, both visible. This is not a bug, just think it might be relevant.</p></li>
<li><p>If I click outside of the form (specifically, where the blue point is in the previous picture is), The header drops to that point:<br /><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/XCmoH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""><br />I can scroll the page and the overflow will show above the header. If I re-focus on a field, the header returns to its proper position.<br />It should be mentioned as well that if I dismiss the keyboard with the ""done"" button instead of pressing outside the focused input, there is no distortion at all.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have tried the following solution:<br /><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8992502/phonegap-jqm-fixed-position-header-footer-moves-after-dismissing-ios-keyboard"">Phonegap JQM Fixed Position Header/Footer Moves After Dismissing iOS Keyboard</a><br />It does work eventually, but you can see the movement of the header and the background behind it, so it's not a good solution for me.</p>

<p>This is how im getting the links from a website/url:</p>

<pre><code>private List&lt;string&gt; getLinks(HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlDocument document)
        {

            List&lt;string&gt; mainLinks = new List&lt;string&gt;();
            var linkNodes = document.DocumentNode.SelectNodes(""//a[@href]"");
            if (linkNodes != null)
            {
                foreach (HtmlNode link in linkNodes)
                {
                    var href = link.Attributes[""href""].Value;
                    if (href.StartsWith(""http://"") ==true || href.StartsWith(""https://"") ==true || href.StartsWith(""www."") ==true) // filter for http 
                    {
                        mainLinks.Add(href);
                    }
                }
            }
            return mainLinks;

        }
</code></pre>

<p>Then im using in this test function to build a List of all the links from the url:</p>

<pre><code>private List&lt;string&gt; test(string url, int levels, DoWorkEventArgs eve)
        {

            HtmlWeb hw = new HtmlWeb();
            List&lt;string&gt; webSites;

                        try
            {
                doc = hw.Load(url);
                webSites = getLinks(doc);
                //retriveImages();
</code></pre>

<p>So webSites wich is a List will have all the link from the main website url fro example if its google.com then in webSites i will have 19 items each one is a link from google.com</p>

<p>And retrieveImages() is:</p>

<pre><code>private void retrieveImages()
        {
            var nodes = doc.DocumentNode.SelectNodes(""//img"");
            foreach (var node in nodes)
            {
                List&lt;string&gt; images = new List&lt;string&gt;();
                images.Add(node.Name);
            } 

        }
</code></pre>

<p>And retrieveImages() for sure is not good code and also is not working. If im using it moving the // and calling the retrieveImages() nothing happened webSites List is empty.</p>

<p>What i want to do is in the function retrieveImages() to build a list of images from the curretn site/link im in now and then also to download the images to the hard disk the images in the List i built.</p>

I put Queue Manager name on the server with proper IP, but when I use <code>SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN</code> as channel name, I have got: <code>Channel name not recognized (AMQ4871)</code> error. </p>

<p>Also, if I have a channel name like MY.CHANNEL.NAME and it is a server-connection channel with <code>mqm</code> as its <code>MCAUSER</code>, can I run some commands (MQSC or OS) through this channel on the server?</p>

<p><strong>Edit1</strong></p>

<p>I am using WebSphere MQ v.7.0</p>

<p>By ""I add a remote Queue Manager to my WebSphere MQ client"" I meant I added a remote queue manager to MQ Explorer.</p>

<p><strong>Edit2</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I want to explain my question more precisely in this edit. I want to connect to a remote Qmanager via MQ Explorer. I know Qmanager name and its IP ofcourse. Also, the remote Qmanager has both <code>SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN</code> and <code>SYSTEM.AUTO.SVRCONN</code> channel available. When I check <code>CHLAUTH</code> for these channels, I've got:</p>

<pre><code>AMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.
   CHLAUTH(SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN)           TYPE(ADDRESSMAP)
   ADDRESS(*)                              USERSRC(CHANNEL)
AMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.
   CHLAUTH(SYSTEM.*)                       TYPE(ADDRESSMAP)
   ADDRESS(*)                              USERSRC(NOACCESS)
dis chl(SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN) MCAUSER

AMQ8414: Display Channel details.
   CHANNEL(SYSTEM.AUTO.SVRCONN)            CHLTYPE(SVRCONN)
   MCAUSER( )
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see here, I should be able to connect via these two channels and run some commands. But when I choose <code>SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN</code> as channel name in remote configuration I get : <code>Channel name not recognized (AMQ4871)</code> and when I choose <code>SYSTEM.AUTO.SVRCONN</code> as channel name, I get: <code>You are not authorized to perform this operation (AMQ4036).</code></p>

<p>Any idea?</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;target name=""StdLogFile""
                        xsi:type=""File""
                        fileName=""${LogFolder}/the-app.log""

</code></pre>

<p>that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Current logfile will be <code>the-app.log</code></li>
<li>Archived logs will be <code>the-app_2015-03-10.log</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We now had the problem, that due to some tests, a fiel <code>the-app_x.log</code> was in the log folder. <strong>This prevented log rotation and NLog simply stopped logging to file at all</strong>.</p>

<h3>Details:</h3>

<p>The log folder contained:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>the-app.log</code> from a previous day</li>
<li><code>the-app_x.log</code> from the same previous day</li>
<li><code>the-app_2015-..-..</code> etc. older archived files</li>
</ul>

<p>NLog failed to rotate the existing <code>the-app.log</code> to the archived name <code>TRDS-Import_2015-03-10.log</code> and did <em>not</em> append to the existing <code>the-app.log</code>.</p>

<p>Renaming ""<code>the-app_x.log</code>"" to ""<code>X the-app_x.log</code>"" fixed the issue, that is NLog then did rename and create a new logfile for today.</p>

<h3>How can we:</h3>

<p>a) Make sure log rotation always works?</p>

<p>b) Make the application <em>error and quit</em> if opening the logfile fails?</p>

"21236219","1","21236453","","2014-01-20 14:13:07","","1","198","<p>I have a list with the following arrangement: <code>N</code> number of sub-lists and <code>N_i</code> number of sub-sub-lists in each sub-list, where <code>N_i</code> is not necessarily equal throughout the sub-lists. Each sub-sub-list contains two elements (this is true for all sub-sub-lists). This is what a short version of such a list would look like with 3 sub-lists and 4, 3, 5 and 1 sub-sub-lists:</p>

<pre><code>a = [[[0.3, 1.2], [0.3, 2.3], [0.3, 4.6], [0.3, 3.4]], [[0.6, 4.5], [0.6, 2.5], [0.6, 7.8]], [[0.2, 1.4], [0.2, 6.3], [0.2, 5.2], [0.2, 2.1], [0.2, 3.6]], [[0.4, 1.3]]]
</code></pre>

<p>I need a way to pick a random sub-sub-list from all those available and store the indexes that point to it.</p>

<p>I could use <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html#random.choice"" rel=""nofollow"">random.choice</a> and do:</p>

<pre><code>import random.choice as r_c
s_s_list = r_c(r_c(a))
print s_s_list
[0.6, 7.8]
</code></pre>

<p>This effectively returns a random sub-sub-list from all available, but it has the following issues:</p>

<p>a- it doesn't give me the <code>i,j</code> indexes that point to it (in this case: <code>[1, 2]</code>) and I can't use <code>a.index(s_s_list)</code> directly because it is a <em>sub-sub-list</em> and</p>

<p>b- since I need to repeat this process <code>M</code> times to obtain <code>M</code> random <strong>distinct</strong> sub-sub-lists (and the indexes that point to them) this won't work.</p>

<p>c- as has been pointed out in the comments, this gives a higher probability of being picked to those sub-sub-lists inside sub-lists with fewer elements and I need every sub-sub-list picked with the same probability.</p>

  <p>--     Use OpenCL:                  NO</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which, if I understand it correctly, means that OpenCL is disabled.</p>

<p>Now, when linking against the compiled version of OpenCV, I get the following message (I redacted the path):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Redacted]/lib/libopencv_core.a(ocl.cpp.o): In function `initOpenCLAndLoad':
  ocl.cpp:(.text.initOpenCLAndLoad+0x2b): warning: Using 'dlopen' in statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am aware of what the message means, but I am confused by its source - why is there OpenCL-invoking code in the compiled OpenCV library? Is there any other option that I need to set so that OpenCL is disabled completely?</p>

<p>Thank you and best regards</p>

<p>While re-using the outer <code>data</code> object would yield better performance, and surely isn't that difficult to accomplish, it seems impossible to re-use the inner <code>timestamp</code> objects.

<p>Opening it in a GUI Libreoffice is already stripping HTML when saving from HTML to TXT so there must be something to accomplish this in command line too.</p>

I can't use the term_node table, as (for other reasons) we have a custom table term_node_hierarchy (with nid and tid only). The table term_node_hierarchy is like term_node but also saves the tid of the parents (from an ""external"" code)</p>

<p>Currently I'm building an array of the nid's that should be displayed on the current page, and passing them like <code>print views_build_view('embed', $view, $matching_nids);</code> but the Argument <strong>Node: ID</strong> states <code>This argument is a single Node ID.</code> As said, only the first node is displayed when printing the views.

<p>Here's the <code>HTML</code> code for UI:</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>By Usage (Code below selects distinct TAXT_CODE)</p>

<pre><code>DistinctBy(TempList, v =&gt; v.TAXT_CODE);
</code></pre>

<p>There's something missing, the TResult of the selector expression. I want it to return any type of data because the properties of tbl_tax_type had different data types. Is this possible?</p>

<p>This is the method that checks for new messages and updates the button.</p>

<pre><code>certmgr.exe -add -all -c &lt;filename&gt;.pfx -s -r localMachine my

<p>My WCF service is running happily using the imported certificate under console mode. Problem starts when I switched my service to be hosted with a Windows Service, which is running as ""NETWORK SERVICE"". The exception is complaining that the application has no access to the private key installed.</p>

<p>So I used FindPrivateKey.exe and found out that the private key is actually installed in the current user's AppData folder:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\S-1-5-21-3289377140-263254259-3378496556-1105\d3a0de64e6f0513692d593a77a71d3ac_15824a33-515a-493c-a33f-38a7b852e11a

<p>It would not work even if I grant ""NETWORK SERVICE"" user the access right to this file.</p>

<p>At the end I have to remove the certificate, and re-imported using MMC, which placed the private key to:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 day</li>

<li>5 days / need to be weekdays ( which is monday to

<p>For the time of days I thought of storing data in minutes, this is easy to figure out.</p>

<p>If there is a weekday condition I thought of using the DAYOFWEEK Indexes, so I could define for 5 days, the first day of rental needs to have index 2 which is Monday, for weekend I could define that the day of rental needs to have index 6, which is Saturday.</p>

<pre><code>rental_type_id | rental_time_in_minutes | rental_label | rental_start_day_indexes

<p>However, I get weird results. jpegData is fine when I put it to an image element however when I create the blob e.g. jpegData is 3200 bytes in size but the Blob created is always 4818 bytes and FileWriter also returns the same position after the write operation. The jpeg created is obviously wrong and doesn't open. I don't understand how I can get the FileWriter to just write the darn binary data into the file without trying to be clever (or stupid). </p>

<p>Can someone please help me in this? Thank you. </p>

<p>How is it possible to convert C into a structure (i.e. 4 structures in this case) so that I have a structure for each location and within the structure I have variables defining each cell.</p>

<p>I also have a variable called 'naming' which is also a 8x4 cell where each cell corresponds to the name of each of the different cells in C. So, each of these strings could be used when defining the arrays in the structure.</p>

<p>I can understand this in pure theory, to encapsulate the contents without needlessly exposing a specific layout such as GridLayout or HorizontalLayout. Encapsulating has benefits of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encouraging de-coupling between classes</li>
<li>Makes it easier to change the layout without having to change the declarations in the outer class.</li>
</ul>

<p>But in terms of practicality, I assume the rendering of a CustomComponent means extra HTML/CSS layout instructions such as perhaps an another <code>div</code>. The last thing Vaadin rendering needs is yet another layering of HTML structure.</p>

<p>I wonder if this might be old folklore. Perhaps using the visual composing tool in Eclipse accepts only <code>CustomComponent</code> objects rather than <code>Layout</code> objects? (Just a wild guess, I have no knowledge)</p>

<p>➤ Alternatively, why not just declare in the outer class a reference variable of type <a href=""https://vaadin.com/api/com/vaadin/ui/Layout.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>com.vaadin.ui.Layout</code></a> to get the same encapsulation?</p>

<p>➤ Am I exaggerating the impact of adding a CustomComponent to Vaadin rendering? </p>

Basically I'm using a queue server that takes input only as byte[] so I'm taking two ints and int[] and converting them using <code>ByteArrayOutputStream</code>.  It has worked fine so far but as I'm transferring a lot of messages back and forth from the queue I am trying to compress my int[](it has several thousand items but the majority are zeros).  I got the idea to take the sequence of zeros and turn them into negative values(see the answer to this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10369660/suggestions-for-compression-library-to-get-byte-as-small-as-possible-without-c"">question</a>. </p>

<p>But I'm having problems because to convert my bytes[] back into the original format I used to take the length of the byte[] and divide it by 4(since each int was 4 in size and then loop through it).  Since I have introduced negative values into the list, the size has changed(by 1 per negative), which is throwing off my ability to unpack the data.  I have tried different ways to get data into Byte[] and ByteArrayOutputStream seems to be the fastest I have tried so far so, unless there is something faster, I prefer to stick with this method. Also in my linked question, the accepted answer has a method that seems to fit perfectly within the existing for loop structure I'm already using to the covert the data(the solution to replace all zero's with negative number of the sequence of zeros).</p>

<p>Any ideas how I can differentiate the stream of positive/negative bytes?</p>

The class is called <code>FUISegmentedControl</code> and it inherits from <code>UISegmentedControl</code>. Here is it's initialize method:</p>

If I then create another DBContext how would I load the same entity into it from the database? This needs to be generic across different entities, so I can't just lookup where the ID's are the same - some entities could have different key properties.</p>

<p>The reason behind the question is that I'm wanting to use the entity loaded into the second context to validate some changed properties in the first one, comparing previous values to new ones. So the second context is purely read only during the validation of the first entity.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit</p>

<p>I tried to keep this simple I think a bit more detail is needed.</p>

<p>Say I have this entity:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class SomeEntity : IValidatableObject
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public int StatusId { get; set; }

    //... Other properties

    public virtual ICollection&lt;SomeOtherEntity&gt; relatedEntity { get; set; }

    public IEnumerable&lt;ValidationResult&gt; Validate(ValidationContext validationContext){
        // validation code
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm trying to do is when the entity is validated the <code>StatusId</code> is compared against the <code>StatusId</code> currently in the database and a validation error could occur - for example say <code>StatusId</code> can't be changed from 1 to 5. As </p>

<p>As Pawel mentioned this can be done by using the OriginalValues however I also need to be able to validate the <code>StatusId</code> based on the values in the <code>relatedEntity</code>. For example say the <code>StatusId</code> can't be changed from 1 to 2 if certain values exist in the <code>relatedEntity</code>.</p>

<p>So in order to do this validation I need a duplicate of the <code>SomeEntity</code> object in its unmodifed form from the database so it can be compared against the object I'm trying to modify.</p>

<p>It's a bit messy but the idea I've come up with is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make <code>SomeEntity</code> a member of a new, empty, interface <code>IMyValidationInterface</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public interface IMyValidationInterface
{
}

public partial class SomeEntity : IValidatableObject, IMyValidationInterface
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    // ....
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Override the <code>ValidateEntity</code> method on <code>MyDBContext</code> so that an object with the original values is passed into the validation method on the entity.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyDBContext : DbContext
{
    protected override DbEntityValidationResult ValidateEntity(DbEntityEntry entityEntry, IDictionary&lt;object, object&gt; items)
    {
        if (entityEntry.Entity is IMyValidationInterface)
        {
            var _validationContext = new MyDbContext();

            /// TODO: some code here to load a duplicated version of 
            ///       the entity from the database

            var originalEntity; // unchanged entity is here

            // unmodified entity is passed as an item to the entities
            // Validate method 
            items.Add(""OriginalEntity"", originalEntity);
         }

         return base.ValidateEntity(entityEntry, items);
     }
}

public partial class SomeEntity : IValidatableObject, IMyValidationInterface
{
    // .....

    public IEnumerable&lt;ValidationResult&gt; Validate(ValidationContext validationContext){
        // validation code
        if (validationContext.Items.ContainsKey(""OriginalEntity"")){
              var originalEntity = (SomeEntity)validationContext.Items[""OriginalEntity""];

              // do validation here and yield return any validation errors
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>The bit I'm stuck on is the TODO part in the above snippet.</p>

Unfortunately the speed is somewhat... lame.  </p>

<p>e.g.
I calculate 2000^4000 (with my bignum library) which takes roughly 1.5 seconds (no flaming please xD). The print including the necessary base conversion however takes about 15 minutes which is quite annoying.</p>

<p>I have tested bc which does both in a lot less than one second.<br>
How does it do that? (Not the multiplication stuff with ffts and whatever only the base conversion)</p>

Before going ahead with implementing this, I wrote a simple program to see how eventfd behaves with select(). It seems that if you use select to wait on an eventfd, it wont return when u write to it in a separate thread. In the code I wrote, the writing thread waits for 5 seconds beginning from program start before writing to the eventfd twice. I would expect the select() to return in the reading thread immediately following this write but this does not happen. The select() returns only after the timeout of 10 seconds and returns zero. Regardless of this return zero, when I try to read the eventfd after 10 seconds, I get the correct value. </p>

<p>I use Ubuntu 12.04.1 (3.2.0-29-generic-pae) i386</p>

<p>Any idea why this is so? It seems to me that select() is not working as it should.</p>

<p>Since I'm using ContextLoaderListener to initialize Spring beans, and from the stacktrace it seems when JSF begin to initialize JSF beans in com.sun.faces.config.ConfigureListener, Spring context has not been set up yet, and that's why this exception happens. </p>

<p>So I'm wondering if there is something wrong with the initialization order between ConfigureListener(JSF) and ContextLoaderListener(Spring), Spring listener should come before JSF listener, but it didn't. Furthermore, JSF listener is configured in JSF impl implicitly and I don't know how can I change their order.</p>

<p>BTW, everything is OK when it's running on Tomcat 7, but on Glassfish 3.1 it messed up. Maybe there's something to do with different container implementation on invoking order of listeners?</p>

<p>Any idea about this problem? Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>What should I do when I receive the <code>connect</code> event?</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This will be a proxy server, serving HTTP and HTTPS</li>
<li>Clients connect on port 3128</li>
<li>When a client makes an HTTPS request the <code>connect</code> event is fired</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally what I would like to do is, proxy the request to the end server, and then give the client the response.</p>

<p>But I can't see any API for doing that here. The <code>connect</code> callback doesn't have the usual arguments of <code>(request, response)</code>, instead it accepts <code>(request, socket, head)</code>.</p>

<p><strong>How do I fulfil the request and issue a response?</strong></p>

<p>I'm currently working against a published xml schema where the original author's habit is to break down the schemas into several .xsd-files, but where some schema files have the same <code>targetNamespace</code>. Is this really ""allowed""?</p>

<p>Example (extremely simplified):</p>

<pre><code>File    targetNamespace    Contents
------------------------------------------------------------
b1.xsd  uri:tempuri.org:b  complex type ""fooType""
b2.xsd  uri:tempuri.org:b  simple type ""barType""

a.xsd   uri:tempuri.org:a  imports b1.xsd and b2.xsd
                           definition of root element ""foo"", that
                           extends ""b:fooType"" with an attribute
                           of ""b:barType""
</code></pre>

<p><em>(Complete file contents below.)</em></p>

<p>Then I have an xml file, <code>data.xml</code>, with this content:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;foo bar=""1"" xmlns=""uri:tempuri.org:a"" xmlns:xs=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For a long time, I have believed that all of this was correct, since Visual Studio apparently allows this schema style. However, today I decided to set up a command line utility for validating xml files, and I chose <code>xmllint</code>.</p>

<p>When I ran <code>xmllint --schema a.xsd data.xml</code>, I was presented with this warning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a.xsd:4: element import: Schemas parser warning : Element '{http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema}import':
  Skipping import of schema located at 'b2.xsd' for the namespace 'uri:tempuri.org:b', since this
  namespace was already imported with the schema located at 'b1.xsd'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that the import of <code>b2.xsd</code> was skipped obviously leads to this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a.xsd:9: element attribute: Schemas parser error : attribute decl. 'bar', attribute 'type':
  The QName value '{uri:tempuri.org:b}barType' does not resolve to a(n) simple type definition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If <code>xmllint</code> is correct, there would be an error in the published specs I'm working against. <em>Is there?</em> And Visual Studio would be wrong. <em>Is it?</em></p>

<p>I do realize the difference between <code>xs:import</code> and <code>xs:include</code>. Right now, I just don't see how <code>xs:include</code> could fix things, since:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>b1.xsd</code> and <code>b2.xsd</code> have the same <code>targetNamespace</code></li>
<li>they both differ in <code>targetNamespace</code> from <code>a.xsd</code></li>
<li>and they do not (need to) know about each other</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this a flaw in the original schema specification? I'm beginning to think that the third bullet point is crucial. Should the fact that they don't know about each other have led to placing them in different namespaces to begin with?</p>

It's pretty much guaranteed that if I post a question with a pointer anywhere someone will come along and suggest that it should be a value instead.  I'm starting to see the light and I have found a lot of places in my code where I could replace dynamic allocation and pointers with stack allocated variables (and usually references).  So I think I have a grasp on using stack allocated objects and passing them to other functions as references when the object lifetime is longer in the caller than the callee.</p>

<p>However I have a question about passing objects by value when the callee will take ownership.  Take the following example:</p>

<pre><code>class Zoo
{
  void AddAnimal(Animal animal);
  std::list&lt;Animal&gt; animals_;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Typically from a flexibility and unit testing perspective I'd want Animal to be an interface (abstract class in C++) so I can easily send arbitrary animals and mock it out with a mock implementation.</p>

<p>In a pointer implementation client code would be calling this like:</p>

<pre><code>Animal animal = new Lion(""Bob"");
myZoo.AddAnimal(animal);
</code></pre>

<p>Here the client code doesn't really need the animal object.  It's just constructing it temporarily to pass to the method.  So in this case there aren't shared semantics.  So it seems like a good case for value semantics.  However, my understanding is that you can't use Animal as a parameter passed by value because it's an abstract class.</p>

<p>Most of my member functions that don't take primitive types take abstract class parameters.  So what is the C++ method to handle this problem?  (That is how do you program to interfaces in C++ with value semantics?)</p>

</code></pre>

<p>To notify only a specific receiver, the method is used like this: (the receiver has to be subscribed of course)</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>event EventHandler&lt;SomethingChangedEventArgs&gt; SomethingChanged;

RaiseEvent(SomethingChanged, args, UpdateReceivers.Single(receiver));
</code></pre>

<p>This will only raise the delegates ""pointing"" to the receiver.</p>

<p>My problem here is when i use a anonymous method to subscribe to the SomethingChanged event its doesnt work when i use this event to notify the object which subscribed to it.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>class EventConsumer
{
   private EventSource _eventSource;

   private void SubscribeEvents()
   {
       // ReactOnEvent() will not be called because the check [@delegate.Target == updateReceiver] doesnt work for anonymous methods
       _eventSource.MyStateChanged += (sender, e) =&gt; ReactOnEvent();

       _eventSource.PublishCurrentState(this);
   }
}

class EventSource
{
    // multiple objects are subscribed to this event
    event EventHandler&lt;MyStateChangedEventArgs&gt; MyStateChanged;

    public void GetCurrentState(object receiver)
    {
        // receiver ask for the current state, only raise event for him
        RaiseEvent(MyStateChanged, args, UpdateReceivers.Single(receiver));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible the get the instance containing a anonymous method? or should i use a complete different approach to solve my problem?</p>

<p>Adding the <code>-std=c++11</code> compilation flag tells <code>g++</code> to enable both the language and the library features, but object files created this way cannot be safely linked with those that used a different <code>-std=</code> setting.  I'd like to be able to use language enhancements like rvalue references, move constructors (for my own classes), and the <code>auto</code> keyword in code that's linked against C++03 libraries.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I'm interested in having <code>g++</code> enable its C++11 <em>language</em> features, but I want it to parse, compile, and link against the old C++03 libraries.  I don't want it to use the C++11 version of the standard library.  This means that in my own code, I'll be able to use <code>auto</code>, range foreach constructs, rvalue references, etc., but I <em>won't</em> be able to use the new C++11 features in the standard C++ library like <code>std::move</code> or rvalue-ref enhancements to the STL containers.  The reason for not wanting the C++11 version of the standard library is that the layout of various objects has changed, so it's invalid to link two object files that expect different versions of the standard library into the same binary.</p>

googled a lot and also found some very important threads here in stackoverflow,specially <strong><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4391530/how-to-use-htaccess-in-wamp-server"">this one</a></strong>. I have made all the changes which are mentioned in the web.Before i talk about the changes i made to my <code>httpd.conf</code>, i want share the directory structure of my <code>wamp</code></p>

<p>root directory for my website is <strong><code>C:/wamp/www/dist</code></strong>. <code>index.php</code> and <code>.htaccess</code> files for my website are kept Within this <strong><em>dist</em></strong> folder and there are other sub-directories for other files for my website.</p>

<p><strong>MY CHANGES ::</strong></p>

<p><code>wamp --&gt; Apache --&gt; Apache modules --&gt; rewrite_module</code> checked it</p>

<pre><code>       ----------------IN MY APACHE httpd.conf file----------------

 LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so //removed # sign from it

 &lt;Directory /&gt;
      Options FollowSymLinks

     Allow from all
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and now i have created a <code>.htaccess</code> file in my <strong><code>C:/wamp/www/dist</code></strong> (index.php is also here)</p>

<p>so my <code>.htaccess</code> looks like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
     Options +FollowSymLinks
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteBase /dist/
     RewriteRule ^([^/]*)\.html$ /dist/?path=$1
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Result/Error ::</strong> It is not working url remains the same(ugly) as before.no changes in url.</p>

<p><strong>Error Explained ::</strong> from my any pages which are in other sub-directories i send  a request to my index.php which looks like <code>http://localhost/dist/?path=home</code> and after checking the value of path variable <code>index.php</code> includes necessary file.so I want to my url as <code>http://localhost/dist/home</code>.but as i said it is not working.my url still remains 
<code>http://localhost/dist/?path=home</code> after creating <strong><code>.htaccess</code></strong> file</p>

<p><strong>Note 1 ::</strong>  i checked <strong><code>phpinfo()</code></strong> the modules are loaded.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2 ::</strong> I tried by removing <code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;</code> from <code>.htaccess</code> but it has no effect all are same again</p>

<p>In the above; I want to change the Version number which I will give when I trigger a build from a tool. </p>

<p>I wanna pass a parameter <strong>$Version</strong> in batch file, it has to take the version number from the tool I use and update the same in that text file.</p>

<p>For ex: in the above text i wanna code it as ""Version"" = ""8:$Version"" hence when ever I provide a version number while triggering a build, it has to update the same in this text file. </p>

<p>Could you please guide me how to edit the specific line. I am new to windows batch scripting. </p>

<p>and i hav to add one more point... in the text file i have to modify the version in the line number 399. So the batch file has to jump to line num 399 in that text file and modify the same. Kindly help me to fix the same ...</p>

<hr>

<p>I had saved the above script in a text pad and saved the same as ver.bat; and also in the same folder I saved the Intext file. When I mention the line number which to be replaced, it is removing the contents which are present after ""="" symbol, from line 1 to 399 . </p>

<p>Before running the batch file:</p>

<pre><code>""ModuleSignature"" = ""8:MergeModule.6F1248514B3047E99E4EE8A129CB8605""
""Version"" = ""8:1.0.0.0""

""TargetPlatform"" = ""3:1""
""PreBuildEvent"" = ""8:""
""PostBuildEvent"" = ""8:""
""RunPostBuildEvent"" = ""3:0""

<p>I mentioned the line number as 10 and after tat if I run the batch file; i get the following output;</p>

<p>I'm using the Knockout mapping plugin in both directions. At each view model level below the root, the ""constructor"" of the current view model accepts its parent view model to keep as a reference, plus the part of the original data necessary to construct itself with. It then creates a new set of mapping options to create its own children.</p>

<p>I've created a heavily simplified fiddle which illustrates this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/tqPtG/17/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/tqPtG/17/</a></p>

<p>There is a lot of heavy readonly metadata which I need from the server on retrieval, but should be omitted when I post the graph back as JSON. I've been using the toJSON prototype method at each level to cull what I don't need, and this was working beautifully at one point but has now stopped working.</p>

<p>Locally, it appears that my toJSON overrides do not even fire (based on alerts and console logs), but in this fiddle, they do fire, but the final object still contains the deleted property ""child"". I can see it being removed by the toJSON method but after the root unmapping it is still there and shown in the alert.</p>

<p>So, 2 questions - what would cause my toJSON overrides to not fire locally, and where is my misunderstanding of the unmapping logic in the simplified fiddle?</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

"4257107","1","4260320","","2010-11-23 14:40:26","","3","1557","<p>Some time ago I had a problem with Uploadify plugin for which I did found a solution described in this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3791724/getting-uploadify-to-work-with-asp-net-mvc/3816084#3816084"">answer</a>.</p>

<p>The problem in that question was substantially due to the fact that Uploadify uses a flash plugin and the flash plugin does not share the authentication cookie with the server-side code. </p>

<p>The solution was to use a custom version of the Authorize attribute (the code was published within that answer). </p>

<p>The attribute [TokenizedAuthorize] was placed on the controller class as follow</p>

<pre><code>[TokenizedAuthorize]
[CheckForActiveService]
public partial class DocumentController : BaseController
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some days ago I have added the <code>&lt;%: Html.AntiForgeryToken() %&gt;</code> inside the form and the 
<code>[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]</code> to the action method as in the following sample:</p>

<pre><code>[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public virtual ActionResult Upload( HttpPostedFileBase fileData ) {
}
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway I am not anymore able to upload files to the server. Using the debugger I have been able to check that after the last line in the <code>TokenizedAuthorize</code> code </p>

<pre><code>return base.AuthorizeCore( httpContext );
</code></pre>

<p>I get an exception handled by Elmah that says </p>

<pre><code>System.Web.Mvc.HttpAntiForgeryException: invalid or not specified anti forgery token

in System.Web.Mvc.ValidateAntiForgeryTokenAttribute.OnAuthorization(AuthorizationContext filterContext)
in System.Web.Mvc.ControllerActionInvoker.InvokeAuthorizationFilters(ControllerContext controllerContext, IList`1 filters, ActionDescriptor actionDescriptor)
in System.Web.Mvc.ControllerActionInvoker.InvokeAction(ControllerContext controllerContext, String actionName)
</code></pre>

<p>This exception seems to confirm that the <code>[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]</code> attribute is being called... but I cant understand where is the issue with my code.</p>

<p>Any help?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>Using the debugger I have checked the value of the <code>__RequestVerificationToken</code> form parameter and, as you can see, it is correctly populated with the value from <code>&lt;%: Html.AntiForgeryToken() %&gt;</code></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ibbZP.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>:</p>

<p>I can also confirm that if I comment the <code>[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]</code> on the Post Action
everything works as expected</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong>:</p>

<p>As the post function is an ajax call done by the uploadify plugin the AntiForgeryToken is added to the post parameters using a small js function as in the following code</p>

<pre><code>$('#fileInput').uploadify({
    //other uploadify parameters removed for brevity
    scriptData: AddAntiForgeryToken({ AuthenticationToken: auth }),
});
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>AddAntiForgeryToken()</code> is a javascript function defined in my master page to support all the ajax post to the server</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%-- used for ajax in AddAntiForgeryToken() --%&gt;
&lt;form id=""__AjaxAntiForgeryForm"" action=""#"" method=""post""&gt;
    &lt;%: Html.AntiForgeryToken() %&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

// Encapsulate the Anti Forgery Token fetching
AddAntiForgeryToken = function (data) {
    data.__RequestVerificationToken = $('#__AjaxAntiForgeryForm input[name=__RequestVerificationToken]').val();
    return data;
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT 4</strong>:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/29407/darin-dimitrov"">Darin</a> intuition is correct. The Uploadify script is not sending any cookie to the server and so the server cannot validate the AntiForgeryToken. How can I add the cookie inside the Uploadify scriptData section?</p>

If it won't skip over <code>10962</code> - <code>10966</code> then this doesn't really matter, as the company doesn't generate that many invoices each year so this will occur in a subsequent year hence not causing a problem hopefully.</p>

I store a nodes with a document:</p>

<p>{_id ,
nodeName,
group}</p>

<p>and storing links in traditional:</p>

<p>{_id, source_id, target_id, value}</p>

<p>Following multiple tutorials on handling joins and multiple relationship in Couch DB I created view:</p>

<pre><code>function(doc) {
  if(doc.type == 'connection') {

      if (doc.source_id) 
        emit(""source"", {'_id': doc.source_id});
      if(doc.target_id)
        emit(""target"", {'_id': doc.target_id});
    }

} 
</code></pre>

<p>which should have emitted sequence of source and target id, then I pass it to the list function with include_docs=true, assumes that source and target come in pairs stitches everything back in a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>{""nodes"":[{""nodeName"":""Name 1"",""group"":""1""},{""nodeName"":""Name 2"",""group"":""1""},],""links"":[{""source"":7,""target"":0,""value"":1},{""source"":7,""target"":5,""value"":1}]}
</code></pre>

<p>Although my list produce a proper JSON, view map returns number of rows of source docs and then target docs.
So far I don't have any ideas how to make this thing working properly - I am happy to fetch additional values from document _id in the list, but so far I havn't find any good examples. 
Alternative ways of achieving the same goal are welcome. _id values are standard for Couch DB so far.</p>

<p>Update: while writing a question I came up with different view which sorted my immediate problem, but I still would like to see other options.
updated map:</p>

<pre><code>function(doc) {
  if(doc.type == 'connection') {

      if (doc.source_id) 
        emit([doc._id,0,""source""], {'_id': doc.source_id});
      if(doc.target_id)
        emit([doc._id,1,""target""], {'_id': doc.target_id});
    }

<p>My setup:<br>
1. Two Kafka Consumers (using high level api) running in separate JVMs start at the same time on the same host. <br>
2. Both consumers have the same group id.<br>
3. Consumer1 subscribes to Topic1, Consumer2 subscribes to Topic2. <br>
4. Both topics are single partition. <br>
5. Using Kafka 0.8.1.1 with 3 servers. </p>

<p>Sometimes this works and both consumers get messages, but most of the time one of two works. In the logs, the one that fails goes through rebalancing the consumer twice and on the second time shuts down after ""Stopping leader finder thread."" </p>

<p>This all works perfectly fine if I use different consumer groups for each consumer. In the setup I described there is obviously no benefit to having both consumers in the same consumer group, other than they can use the same config file. I am trying to figure out if I should support this behavior or not. </p>

<pre><code>if array &amp;&amp; !array.include?('Bob')

<p>But you could also say:</p>

<p>or:</p>

<p>or a wacky double unless:</p>

  #do stuff unless array.include?('Bob')

<p>I am implementing a computation over multiple time frames, and each frame has millions of points. I use a cluster with 6 nodes, and each node has 20 threads. I assign each node to only 1 MPI process, and it utilizes 20 shared threads. Here is the main line of my job file</p>

<pre><code>mpiexec -ppn 1 -np 6 -env OMP_NUM_THREADS 20 ./mycode
</code></pre>

<p>Suppose I have to compute 60 time frames. Here is my parallelization:</p>

<ul>
<li>I used MPI to parallelize over <em>time steps</em>. If there are 6 nodes with 60 time frames, I can assign each node to compute 10 time frames. Time frame computations are independent, so MPI process are not communicating except with root process.</li>
<li>In each MPI process should compute 10 independent time frames. In each time frame, the <em>points</em> are parallelized using OpenMP.</li>
</ul>

<p>The final outputs of my code are 60 data sets that need to be written in 60 separate files. Almost all of communications between nodes are only sending output results from slaves to root. Depending on whether the root process work or be idle I can design root and slaves in multiple ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In first implementation, the root process (node 0) is doing computation as well as slave nodes (nodes 1 to 5), so each has to compute 10 frames. In all nodes (either root or slaves) output data of each of the 10 time frame are written to file immediately after they are computed (if it's in root), or send back to the root node (if it's in slave node).</p>

<p>Obviously this is a wrong approach since root is busy, root and slaves can not meet to send/receive result, so it blocks slave nodes to iteration over next time frames. For instance slave node 2 should wait till all 10 computations of root finish and then root receive data from node 2, and finally node 2 moves to the next time frame computation.</p></li>
<li><p>To avoid blockage, I can send back slave's results by keeping them on MPI's buffer, so slaves are free to move onto the next time frame iteration. However, the data are taking a lot of memory and it might not be a good idea to have 10 huge data sets waiting on buffer till root node receive then at the end of it's job.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of buffering data, slaves can send data at the end rather sending them right after they are computed. That is, slave node 2 computes all 10 time frames without sending them. Meanwhile the root process is almost finished computation of it's 10 frames at the same time. At the end all slave nodes send their results to root node. This is effective since (A) root is not idle, (B) there is no blockage. However the problem is that memory on the slave nodes are limited and they can not keep all 10 time frame results. It is better to send results back to root process right after they are computed, and then clear memory for next iteration.</p></li>
<li><p>Or do not use root process for any computation. Each slave has to compute 60/(6-1)=12 time frames, and root node only waits for receiving data. The problem is that root node has 20 idle threads, only one of them are used for communication while 19 other threads are not used at all. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Could you please let me know that what is the best design for this hybrid parallelization in this case? Is it possible to split root node to 1 + 19 threads, the first thread only be used for receiving and writing data, while the other 19 threads of root perform computation alongside slaves?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>PerformSync</p>

<p>I have a list adapter with a content observer that should reflect the synced information.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
If all of this is sound,  my current dilemma is how an when to delete items from the database. I am assuming I should refrain from any deletions while the content is in use, but in my sync adapter, how do I know if the data is currently being observed? (static map of observers?)</p>

<p><strong>Supplemental:</strong>
Beyond that, I would love to have some examples of this in action, so I can anticipate other problems. I know about the google IO talk, it has some great high level philosophy, but specifics would do wonders for many non-guru devs. </p>

<p>I would think this is an extremely valuable function that all Android advocates would want to be done, and done right, as the sync adapter presents one of the most desirable features of Android, and can only help to increase the userbase, helping all of us.</p>

related to this scenario:</p>

    details = models.TextField()

<p>They're exposed in the admin using admin.py. My question is this:</p>

<p>1) How can I make the details_url property in the Master-model so that
when exposed in the admin.py a user can click it and go the listing of
details and only see details related to that instance of Master-model?</p>

<p>2) If this can only be done using a custom view, how do I get the view
to produce a page looking like the rest of the admin? I know I can use
the same template code as the admin, but is there a faster way to
produce for instance listings like the details in my case? Generic
views/classes?</p>

<p>3) Adding Master to list_filter for the detailsAdmin-class is not
possible due to the amount of Master-records. Or is it ...? And even
if it was possible, how can I set filters from another page, like if I
click a link in the change_list for Master-model going to the Details
change_list, how can I set the filtering to be set to a specific
instance of a Master model?</p>

<p>In short; all I want is the have the change_list filtered to only show
details related to a specific master-record and reuse as much of the

<p>I have a very generic error now called my_error::validate, but want to provide more specific versions in my library. Generally people will want to use:</p>

<pre><code>if (ec == bc::error::validate)
    // ...
</code></pre>

<p>However sometimes they may wish to see the specific error associated with that std::error_code or print the error message.</p>

<pre><code>// ec.message() says ""check_block() failed to do XYZ""
assert(ec == bc::error::check_block);
</code></pre>

<p>I want to be able to enable something like:</p>

<pre><code>if (ec == bc::error::validate)
{
    if (ec == bc::error::check_block)
        // bc::error::check_block is a more specific case of bc::error::validate

<p>This is what i've written so far. I've gotten the code to print out new text every time a button is clicked. but the code doesn't differentiate between each button, so it doesn't matter if it's button1 or button2, the same situation happens</p>

<pre><code>NoSuchElementException was unhandled by user code
An exception of type 'OpenQA.Selenium.NoSuchElementException' occurred in WebDriver.dll but was not handled in user code
Additional information: Unable to locate element: {""method"":""css selector"",""selector"":""#assessment-472 .status-PushedToSEAS""}
</code></pre>

<p>It's thrown right here:</p>

<pre><code>Thread.Sleep(600);
wait.Until(drv =&gt; drv.FindElement(By.CssSelector(""#"" + assessmentQueueId + "" .status-PushedToSEAS"")));
</code></pre>

<p>I can see the browser it opens, watch it get to that point, and inspect element to see that the element exists.  Its id is exactly correct.</p>

<p>We have this problem <strong>A LOT</strong> and so far the solution has been to throw <code>Thread.Sleep(600)</code> (or some similar time) in front of it.  The whole point of <code>wait.Until()</code> is to not have to do that, and this is making our test suites get very long.  Also, as you can see, sometimes we have the problem even after putting a <code>Thread.Sleep()</code> in front of it and we have to extend the time.</p>

<p>Why is .NET Selenium's <code>WebDriver.Until()</code> not working, and is there a different way to do the same thing without just waiting a set period of time?  Again, the problem is intermittent, meaning that it only happens sometimes, and it could happen at any number of <code>wait.Until()</code> statements, not just the one shown!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>This is a class variable.
<code>private WebDriverWait wait;</code></p>

<p>The problem is this. When the while loops finish one run and proceed to 2nd run, the code hangs in the part when monkeyrunner is waiting for connection. To be exact, this is the part where it stops</p>

<p>the message says ""Monkey command wake"".</p>

<p>I assume that the problem has something to do with the connection, not with the thread because I tried to print something before that line which makes a connection and it works. </p>

<li>Non-public fields/auto-properties are serialized only when a custom attribute is applied on them (I have a variety of those: <code>[Save]</code>, <code>[Serialize]</code> and <code>[SerializeField]</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Now I'd like to adapt my protobuf-net model to adapt to these rules so I don't have to use any of protobufs custom attributes like <code>ProtoContract</code>, <code>ProtoMember</code> etc.</p>

<p>The way I figured I could do this, is by having an array of serializable types that the user would add his custom types to (that way he doesn't need ProtoContract on those types) - I would iterate on those types and add them to my model. Foreach type, I would get the members that would satisfy my serialization rules, and add those to the model too. </p>

<p>Another thing I'd like, is say you have an abstract class <code>A</code> with children <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>, users don't have to explicitly add <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>, they just add <code>A</code> and I would get <code>A</code>'s children and add them myself.</p>

<p>My question boils down to: Instead of users having to write this:</p>

<pre><code>[ProtoContract]
[ProtoInclude(1, typeof(Child1))]
[ProtoInclude(2, typeof(Child2))]
public abstract class AbstractBase
{
    public abstract int Num { get; set; }
}

[ProtoContract]
public class Child1 : AbstractBase
{
    [ProtoMember(1)]
    public int x;

    public override int Num { get { return x; } set { x = value; } }
}

[ProtoContract]
public class Child2 : AbstractBase
{
    [ProtoMember(1)]
    public int y;
    [ProtoMember(2)]
    public int z;

    public override int Num { get { return y; } set { y = value; } }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would like them to be able to write this:</p>

<pre><code>[Serializble]
public abstract class AbstractBase
{
    public abstract int Num { get; set; }
}

[Serializble]
public class Child1 : AbstractBase
{
    public int x;

    public override int Num { get { return x; } set { x = value; } }
}

[Serializble]
public class Child2 : AbstractBase
{
    public int y;
    public int z;

    public override int Num { get { return y; } set { y = value; } }
}

// ProtobufSerializableTypes.cs
public static Type[] SerializableTypes = new[]
{
    typeof(AbstractBase)
};
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what I tried:</p>

<pre><code>[TestClass]
public class ProtobufDynamicSerializationTestSuite
{
    private AbstractBase Base { get; set; }
    private Type[] SerializableTypes { get; set; }

    {
        Base = new Child1();
        SerializableTypes = new[]

        };
    }

            return model.Add(type, false);
        };

        var hierarchy = new Dictionary&lt;MetaType, List&lt;Type&gt;&gt;();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; SerializableTypes.Length; i++)
        {
            var type = SerializableTypes[i];
            var meta = addType(type);
            var temp = new List&lt;Type&gt;();
            var children = type.Assembly.GetTypes().Where(t =&gt; t.IsSubclassOf(type) &amp;&amp; !t.IsAbstract).ToList();
            for(int j = 0; j &lt; children.Count; j++)
            {
                var child = children[j];
                addType(child);

                meta.AddSubType(j + 1, child);
                temp.Add(child);
            }
            hierarchy[meta] = temp;
        }

        Func&lt;Type, string[]&gt; getMemberNames = x =&gt;

                             .Select(m =&gt; m.Name)
                             .ToArray();

        foreach (var entry in hierarchy)
        {

    void log(string msg)
    {
        log(msg, new object[0]);

}
</code></pre>

<p>So my attempt was to add all the necessary types to the model, add all children types to parent types, and then iterate on all added types and add to the model the appropriate fields/properties (that correspond to my serialization rules) from that type</p>

<p>This is failing however to:</p>

<pre><code>Test Name:  ShouldCopyWithCustomConfig
Test Outcome:   Failed
Result Message: 
Test method ProtobufTests.ProtobufDynamicSerializationTestSuite.ShouldCopyWithCustomConfig threw exception:

adding subtype Child1 with id 1
adding type: Child2
adding subtype Child2 with id 2
adding member x to type Child1 with id 1
</code></pre>

<p>What am I doing wrong? and is there a better way to do this?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that initially I didn't have this dictionary step, I tried to add a type's members right after adding it to the model, but this fails if I have say, type <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, <code>A</code> has a <code>B</code> reference, if I try to add the type <code>A</code> and its members, I will come along <code>B</code> which protobuf is unable to identify at this stage, because it's not added to the model yet... So I thought it was necessary to add the types first, then their members...</p>

"17847758","1","17848445","","2013-07-25 01:58:30","","4","172","<p>Say I have a class that has a few methods that depend on another object in order to carry out their duty. The difference being they all depend on the same class of object, but need different instances of the class. Or more specifically, each method needs a clean instance of the class because the methods will be modifying the state of the dependency.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example I had in mind.</p>

<pre><code>class Dependency {
    public $Property;
}


class Something {
    public function doSomething() {
        // Do stuff
        $dep = new Dependency();
        $dep-&gt;Property = 'blah';
    }

    public function doSomethingElse() {
       // Do different stuff
       $dep = new Dependency(); 
       $dep-&gt;Property = 'blah blah';
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Technically I could do this.</p>

<pre><code>class Something {
    public function doSomething(Dependency $dep = null) {
        $dep = $dep &amp;&amp; is_null($dep-&gt;Property) ? $dep : new Dependency();
        $dep-&gt;Property = 'blah';
    }

    public function doSomethingElse(Dependency $dep = null) {
       $dep = $dep &amp;&amp; is_null($dep-&gt;Property) ? $dep : new Dependency();
       $dep-&gt;Property = 'blah blah';
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My trouble here is I constantly have to check that the dependent object being passed in is in the correct state. The state being newly created. So instead I was thinking of just doing something like this.</p>

<pre><code>class Something {
    protected $DepObj;

    public function __construct(Dependency $dep) {
        $this-&gt;DepObj = $dep &amp;&amp; is_null($dep-&gt;Property) ? $dep : new Dependency();
    }
    public function doSomething() {
        // Do stuff
        $dep = clone $this-&gt;DepObj;
        $dep-&gt;Property = 'blah';
    }

    public function doSomethingElse() {
       // Do different stuff
       $dep = clone $this-&gt;DepObj;
       $dep-&gt;Property = 'blah blah';
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This allows me to get one instance of an object in the correct state, and I can just copy it if I need another one. I'm just curious if this makes sense, or if I'm over looking a fundamental guideline about dependency injection and keeping code testable.</p>

Old post:</p>

<p>I am write a package in Perl for parsing INI files. 
Just something based on <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/Config%3A%3ATiny"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Config::Tiny</code></a>.</p>

<p>I want to keep the order of sections &amp; keys, so I use extra array to store the order.</p>

<p>But when I use "" <code>$Config-&gt;{newsection} = { this =&gt; 'that' }; # Add a section</code> "", I need to overload '<code>=</code>' so that ""newsection"" and ""this"" can be pushed in the array.</p>

<p>Is this possible to make ""<code>$Config-&gt;{newsection} = { this =&gt; 'that' };</code>"" work without influence   other parts ?</p>

<p>Part of the code is:</p>

<pre><code>sub new {
    my $invocant = shift;
    my $class = ref($invocant) || $invocant;
    my $self = {']' =&gt; []};	# ini section can never be ']'
    return bless $self, $class;
}
sub read_string {
	if ( /^\s*\[\s*(.+?)\s*\]\s*$/ ) {
		$self-&gt;{$ns = $1} ||= {'=' =&gt; []};	# ini key can never be '='
		push @{$$self{']'}},$ns;
		next;
	}
	if ( /^\s*([^=]+?)\s*=\s*(.*?)\s*$/ ) {
		push @{$$self{$ns}{'='}},$1 unless defined $$self{$ns}{$1};
		$self-&gt;{$ns}-&gt;{$1} = $2;
		next;
	}
}
sub write_string {
	my $self = shift;
	my $contents = '';
	foreach my $section (@{$$self{']'}}) {
}}

<p>I'm calculating the difference between two dates using JS. I am trying to get a result accurate to a second. I've been getting on very well with it, but noticed an issue. The first two dates shown below show a difference of 5 years, but as soon as I add one more year to the future date, it shows 5 years, 1 Day. Where is the extra day coming from? When the future date hits 2020, it adds another day into the result, this is a recurring pattern. Can someone enlighten me? I don't have any leap year calculations involved yet, I've put my code below:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){

    var todaysDate = new Date('2010/11/24 23:00:00');   
    var futureDate = new Date('2020/11/24 22:59:00');

    calculateTime(todaysDate,futureDate);
});

function calculateTime(todaysDate,futureDate){  
    var difference = futureDate.getTime() - todaysDate.getTime(); 

    var years = Math.floor(difference/1000/60/60/24/365);
        difference -= years*1000*60*60*24*365;

    var days = Math.floor(difference/1000/60/60/24);
        difference -= days*1000*60*60*24;

    var hours = Math.floor(difference/1000/60/60);
        difference -= hours*1000*60*60;

    var minutes = Math.floor(difference/1000/60);
        difference -= minutes*60*1000;

    var seconds = Math.floor(difference/1000);

    var result = years + ' Years, ';
        result += days + ' Days, ';
        result += hours + ' Hours, ';

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Given <code>N</code> stations, each at a position <code>x_i</code> on the number line, we want to move a robot from the first station to the last station (stations are sorted in non-decreasing <code>x_i</code> order) at the lowest monetary cost. We have a robot that starts out with a maximally charged battery with <code>K</code> (not necessarily integral) units of power, and can move <code>E</code> (not necessarily integral) units of length per unit of power spent. At any station in-between the first and last station we can recharge. Each station charges the same flat rate <code>F</code> dollars to start charging, plus <code>c_i</code> dollars per unit power replenished. The robot <em>ONLY</em> can charge if its power at the time is at or below <code>K/2</code> <em>OR</em> it cannot reach the next station without charging; every time the robot charges, it has to charge to 100% (i.e. <code>K</code>).</p>

<p><strong>My solution:</strong> I'm pretty sure this is a variation on a shortest path problem, except we are optimizing for monetary cost. I'm running Dijkstra SSSP. However, for each state we need to keep track of both monetary cost and energy remaining, because racking up a higher cost earlier on by charging at a cheap station may be better than saving your money until the end. So instead of keeping maintaining <code>cost[i]=cheapest known way to get to station i</code>, I maintain <code>cost[i][energy]=cheapest known way to get to station i with a certain energy</code>. In the priority queue, I order the states by cost only because I'm not sure there's a way to create a heuristic for both cost and energy remaining. This algorithm is really slow on some test cases because if <code>E</code> and <code>K</code> were large, then each station can potentially travel to every station in front of it, creating a massive graph. I think I have to prune the search frontier, but I'm not sure how. Any ideas?</p>

If I create a brand new web site in Visual Studio 2013 that consists entirely of a single static file, <code>test.js</code>, and launch it using the IIS Express 8.5 that came with visual studio, I am able to view the contents of that file in my browser.</p>

<p>But, if I then go into <em>Web.Config</em> and turn on Windows Authentication using the code below, that same path now becomes a 404.0 error.</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;system.webServer&gt;

<p>If, however, I follow this same procedure on a local path, it works just fine. It also works if I open the site in Visual Studio 2010 and run it with the ASP.NET Development Server. </p>

<p>Since it is Windows 8, which prevents other users (and by extension anything running as Administrator) from seeing my network drives, one possibility that occurred to me was that IIS might elevate itself when I turn on Windows Auth, but according to the task manager the IIS worker process is still running as me.</p>

<p>So far, I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Switching to a ""Classic"" app pool so that I can turn on on <code>&lt;identity impersonate=""true""/&gt;</code>. (had no effect)</li>
<li>Changing the <code>physicalPath</code> of the <code>&lt;virtualDirectory/&gt;</code> to the UNC path of the share. (changes the error to 401.3, not authorized)</li>
<li>Giving Everyone full control of the folder on the file server. (had no effect)</li>

</ul>

<p>One thing that <em>has</em> worked is giving ""Everyone"" access to the share itself, but for obvious security reasons I can't leave it like that. This also only solves the problem with <code>physicalPath</code> set to the UNC path (which Visual Studio likes to overwrite). </p>

<p>This is a <code>MWE</code> of the code:</p>

<pre><code>import random
import numpy as np

def random_data(N, a, b):
    # Generate some random data.
    return np.random.uniform(a, b, N).tolist()

# Obtain values for x.
x = random_data(100, 0., 1.)
# Obtain error/sigma values for x.
x_sigma = random_data(100, 0., 0.2)

# Generate new x values shuffling each float around a
# Gaussian distribution with a given sigma.
x_gauss = random.gauss(np.array(x), np.array(x_sigma))

print x-x_gauss
</code></pre>

<p>What I find is that the result of doing <code>x-x_gauss</code> is a list of floats that is <strong>always either positive or negative</strong>. This means the <code>random.gauss</code> call is always assigning either a larger new value for each float in <code>x</code> or a smaller one <em>for all values in <code>x</code></em>.</p>

<p>I would expect the <code>random.gauss</code> call to shuffle the floats in <code>x</code> around its values both to the right and to the left, since this is a random process.</p>

<p>Why is this not happening? Am I understanding something wrong about the process?</p>

<p>Obviously loading 100,000+ records into an array when the viewscreen/viewport only shows 30 odd records in a go is a tad silly.</p>

<p>In addition, I am not sure if storing all this data in an object is the right thing to do either.</p>

<p>So my question is, is it possible to stagger sqlite through records, say 50 records in cache and then when you swipe down or up it loads an appropriate amount into the cache.  I guess its similar to the JQuery Lazy Loading library where it only loads a little bit on the view port and then loads more as you move down.</p>

<p>I'm looking at JSON, but it appears to only be for Web services as it requires a URL and I am not sure if it works for files that are on the phone.</p>

<p>Therefore. Is there a proper way to load sqlite data into Objective C arrays/objects without causing problems when the data suddenly starts to scale?</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

I put the TextBox in a ScrollViewer, and everything is fine; I disable the ScrollViewer when the TextBox gets focus, so it scrolls automatically while the user is typing.</p>

<p>My problem is, I want the user to be able to scroll while editing the note, just as he's able to scroll while reading the note. I thought the only way to do this would be to hold down until the oversized caret appears, then moving it around, but I discovered that, in fact, third party apps support this type of scrolling.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to achieve is something like Word/OneNote on the phone, where the user can easily scroll while editing the document (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=dj4fbce3_zI#t=337s"" rel=""nofollow"">here's a video</a> demonstrating it). The same effect is seen in the Skype and Facebook apps where, while writing a message, you can scroll it to see more of it.</p>

<p>I wonder if this is a custom control, or if the layout was designed in a specific way, because a TextBox inside a ScrollViewer simply doesn't work.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate any help. Thanks in advance.</p>

<pre><code>        private void BtnGetLogs_OnClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)

                    var isoStream = new IsolatedStorageFileStream(LogFileName, FileMode.Open, isoStore);

                    var reader = new StreamReader(isoStream);
                    string text = reader.ReadToEnd();
                    SendLogsToEmail(text.Substring(length));
         }
</code></pre>

<p>This is the function where i am sending an email, </p>

<pre><code>        private void SendLogsToEmail(string body)
        {

            var emailComposeTask = new EmailComposeTask();
            {
                emailComposeTask.Subject = ""Log file to mail"";

                emailComposeTask.Body = body;

                emailComposeTask.To = ""sample@gmail.com"";
            };

            emailComposeTask.Show();
        }
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to give a background on this issue as well. This is purely a windows phone 8.0 project so i wont be able to send any attachments. That is the reason i am trying to read all the file contents and send it over the mail. Please note that this is work around solution for something i am working on. This is an edge case scenario where i am not able to fetch logs from IsoStoreSpy or any other tools because of OEM security issues. So in the app itself i have a button click event which reads the isolated storage file and sends a mail to the specified user. </p>

<p>Here's the problem, 
I get an ArgumentOutOfRangeException at  <code>emailComposeTask.Show();</code> and the error message is, </p>

<pre><code>Specified argument was out of the range of valid values.
Parameter name: The size of input should not exceed 64K.

<p>The log file is a pretty big file actually. Is there an elegant solution to this problem? </p>

<p>For making the access decision we have <strong>urlAccessDecisionManager</strong> , along with three voters as shown below:  </p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;bean id=""roleVoter"" class=""org.springframework.security.access.vote.RoleVoter""/&gt;

        &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;/constructor-arg&gt;
    &lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is that RoleVoter is not working even though the role start with 'ROLE_'(found out this after reading different blogs and questions) . So to find the problem i debugged the spring security source and found out that supports() method of RoleVoter was returning false.So i looked into the method further:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>public boolean supports(ConfigAttribute attribute) {
        if ((attribute.getAttribute() != null)
                &amp;&amp; attribute.getAttribute().startsWith(getRolePrefix())) {
            return true;
        }
        else {
            return false;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>It turned out that <em>attribute.getAttribute()</em> was returning NULL because the attribute was object of type <strong>WebExpressionConfigAttribute</strong> , which by default returns NULL for <em>getAttributed()</em> method. </p>

<p>At the same time i debugged our old code which is using Spring Security 3.0.1 , and found that in the old code the attribute object was of type <strong>SecurityConfig</strong>.</p>

<p>So can someone please point out what configuration mistake we have made because of which the user is not able to get access to link even though he has all ROLES tagged to him.</p>

<p>The testing procedure is following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run grails application, take Delme row with given id (say, 1) into edit form.</li>
<li>Do the ""sql update delme set d2='bad value', version=version+1 where id=1;"" on the database server.</li>
<li>Do the ""sql select * from delme where id=1;"" on the database server and verify that d2 has value set in step 2 and version is actually incremented.</li>
<li>Change DSC field value in the opened edit form and hit ""update"" button.</li>
<li>Result: update goes smoothly, D2 value set in step 2 goes to nowhere silently, no exceptions happens. Bad.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, <strong>Question 1</strong>: what's wrong above? Why optimistic locking is not working out of the box for me?</p>

<p>Well, I surrendered with default optimistic locking behaviour and wrote my own (considering that our actual business tables doesn't have 'version' columns and pessimistic lock is not an option in OLTP env):
I made 'version' transient, filled it in onLoad method and checked in preUpdate:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity

  // unisteresting stuff...

  @Transient

        om.configure (com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.SerializationFeature.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS, false);
        this.version = om.writeValueAsString (this);
      } catch (com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException e) {
         System.out.println (""Jackson exception caught on #"" + this.id);
         e.printStackTrace();
         this.version = ""/x/"";
     }
   }

   @javax.persistence.PreUpdate
   public void actualOnUpdate (Session s) throws StaleObjectStateException {

     SessionFactory sessionFactory = s.getSessionFactory();
     Session ns = null;
     Object newInstance = null;
     String dbVersion = null;

     try  {
       ns = sessionFactory.openSession();
       Transaction tx = ns.beginTransaction ();
       newInstance =   ns.get (this.getClass(), this.id);
       dbVersion = ((DelmeV) newInstance).getVersion();
       tx.commit();
     } catch (Throwable ex) {
       System.out.println (""Session creation exception caught on "" + this.getClass().getName() + "", id="" + this.id);
       ex.printStackTrace();
     } finally {
       ns.close();
     }
   boolean eq = dbVersion.equals (this.version);
   if (!eq) {
     throw new StaleObjectStateException (this.getClass().getName(), this.id);
   }
 }
}

<p>I registered event listeners which scan domain class for @preUpdate method and call it as long as Grails doesn't call it automatically. So far so good, solution is working, but it happened to be incompatible with other frameworks (Spring Batch, specifically) as JPA requires @preUpdate method to be with empty argument list and I have no idea how to figure out current Session or SessionFactory (or EntityManagerFactory, as long as JPA involved) from preUpdate method (in Grails I passed Session as parameter invoking preUpdate method from event listener). So <strong>Question 2</strong>: How to figure out Session/SessionFactory/EntityManagerFactory from domain method in consistent, framework independent way?</p>

I've gotten sqlplus, as well as Perl and Python to run on these.  Now I am trying to build ROracle.  It needs to be built from source, so I downloaded it and have tried running:</p>

<pre><code>R CMD INSTALL ROracle_1.1-10.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>However, I think it is expecting a different directory structure than what the Instant Client has given me.  For instance, when I try to run that command, I get:</p>

<pre><code>$ R CMD INSTALL ROracle_1.1-10.tar.gz
* installing to library ‘/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/library’
* installing *source* package ‘ROracle’ ...
** package ‘ROracle’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
configure: error: ""/Applications/instantclient_11_2/lib"" directory does not exist
ERROR: configuration failed for package ‘ROracle’
* removing ‘/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/library/ROracle’
</code></pre>

<p>It is true, that I don't have a 'lib' directory in my '/Applications/instantclient_11_2' directory.  I did however try to fake it out by creating one and linking to the .dylib files in the '/Applications/instantclient_11_2' directory, and I got past that error to a new one:</p>

<pre><code>$ R CMD INSTALL ROracle_1.1-10.tar.gz
* installing to library ‘/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/library’
* installing *source* package ‘ROracle’ ...
** package ‘ROracle’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
configure: error: ""/Applications/instantclient_11_2/rdbms/public"" directory does not exist
ERROR: configuration failed for package ‘ROracle’
* removing ‘/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/library/ROracle’
</code></pre>

<p>So it is now looking for another directory that isn't there.  I don't want to keep going and guessing at the directories it is expecting and trying to back-populate it with links to files it should be expecting in those directories (I don't even know what it might be expecting here).</p>

<p>Is there another way to go about installing this?  I'm thinking I should be able to do this based upon the fact that Perl and Python can use these drivers.</p>

<p>Thanks,

<p>You will notice there is quite a lot of code duplication in the two tests for creating a list that GetAll can return...</p>

<p>Is it good/bad practice to have say a re-usuable function to return that list that both test could call?</p>

I was thinking about application updates recently, how software like Google Chrome forces automatic updates, how Microsoft uses automatic updates but doesn't force them if you don't really want them, and how some leave it up to the user entirely.</p>

<p>One one hand, forcing automatic updates can be good, for reasons of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Stability</li>
<li>Breaking changes happen for everyone at once</li>
<li>No need to service older releases</li>
<li>Everyone's got the latest and greatest all the time</li>
<li>""I don't want to upgrade because I don't think I need to"" whereas the user's judgement may be flawed in this case</li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine if IE had forced automatic updates - the number of users who had hacked away in order to use IE6 would be so tiny we wouldn't have had any of the problems we did because of it (and still do and will for a small while longer).</p>

<p>On the other hand, forcing automatic updates can be bad:</p>

<ul>
<li>Might break things</li>
<li>Some users feel it invades their privacy</li>
<li>Using system resources the user might not have/want to use at the time</li>
<li>""User knows best"" (or do they?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you think forced automatic updates are good or bad <em>always</em>? Or does it depend on the situation (I think we can all agree they are never ALWAYS good, but are they ALWAYS bad)? In what situations do you think they should be used?</p>

<p>CW'ed since I think this is fairly subjective.</p>

<p>Point is that after i get ip I have something like this : ""::ffff:192.168.1.10"" (explained at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24896386/request-connection-remoteaddress-now-prefixed-in-ffff-in-node-js"">request.connection.remoteAddress Now Prefixed in ::ffff in node.js</a> )</p>

<p>I am missing understanding about how a list of values gets serialized, deserialized, and saved. For e.g. I am not sure how to properly implement <code>from_native</code> in the <code>SurveyRecipientField</code>. I expected it to be an individual number, but it's a list of numbers. But it doesn't seem acceptable to return a list of objects.</p>

<p>I am setting up my site to serve Static Content from a Cookieless Domain - using a subdomain and .htaccess. I have pages with many thumbnails and I don't want the cookie info sent with each image request.</p>

<p>In htaccess I have a rewrite rule which directs all my traffic to the www domain</p>

<pre><code>RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^example.com [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.example.com/$1 [L,R=301]
</code></pre>

<p>I created a CNAME record static.example.com and point it to www.example.com. </p>

<p>My image requests now point to static.example.com and in Firebug I am looking at the Net tab. The request header shows the PHP Session Cookie <code>PHPSESSID=....</code> and the response header shows no Cookie.</p>

<p><strong>First Question:</strong></p>

<p>Is having the session cookie in the request header unavoidable, or should I be trying to get rid of this as well? All requests come from a common directory (and its subdirectories). Should I do something like this? </p>

<pre><code>RequestHeader unset Cookie
Header unset Cookie
Header unset Set-Cookie
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I tried putting this in the .htaccess in the directory of the jpg files - but headers were not blocked for the images served</p>

<p><strong>Second Question:</strong></p>

<p>Also, do I need to explicitly set the domain property of all my cookies? <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Domain_and_Path"" rel=""nofollow"">Docs</a> say that if the domain is not specified then the current domain is used as the default. My current domain should always be www, right? But in response to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32152684/serving-static-content-from-a-cookieless-domain-using-subdomain-and-htaccess"">my last post</a>, someone said </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You'll need to explicitly set all your cookies for www.example.com so
  that they won't be shared among subdomains</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When looking at my www.example.com cookies (in firfox) which were set without specifying the domain, it shows the ""host"" as www.example.com but the ""site"" as example.com.

<p>My question is, how do I find the location of the receiver in the grid?
How do I find where all three circles intersect? 
I tried setting the equations of the circles equal to each other and solving but that didn't give me anything, it gave me imaginary numbers.</p>

<p>I can also edit the code to make the circles unfilled if that helps.
The radius of each circle can be changed</p>

<p>The signal strength of each transmitter is known in advance by the receiver and the strengths can also be changed (in the 100, 200, or 300 range or any other range)</p>

<p>How can I convert the video stream so that each final image shows all image data, so that information from B and P frames is included in all frames?</p>

I have the code that I have so far (currently only computes the rate of growth which is part of the assignment). So what I need to do is to take all the values that the user inputs (bv1, ev_1, ev_2, ev_3, ev_4, and ev_5...), and use them to plot points on a line graph that has the amount of money on the Y-Axis, and the year on the X-Axis. For the labels of the graph I am also supposed to use HTML formatting in Java for the labels for the axes. I know I am supposed to use stuff like superpaint g, and @Override, but I am not sure where to start (some example code would help). Any help is appreciated as this assignment is due tomorrow!</p>

<p>There are properties of F which have been defined in class A, which I need to access inside class B. (a MySQL connection and a logging handler.)</p>

<p>I would like B to have the properties which have been set to F, when they were instantiated initially in A, so I can use the logging/mysql handlers inside B without re-instantiating them.</p>

<p>How can I go about this? Sorry if the question is unclear.</p>

<p>Kigg implements both an <code>Add</code> and <code>Remove</code> method on each repository class ( <b>Note</b>: <code>BaseRepository</code> has virtual methods than can be overloaded by each concrete implementation.)</p>

<p>The implementations for the <code>Kigg.Repository.LinqToSql.CategoryRepository</code> and the <code>Kigg.Repository.LinqToSql.StoryRepository</code> both cascade deletes via their <code>Remove</code> methods in order to delete child entities.  ( <b>Note</b>:  Category has a parent relationship (one-to-many) to Story, so they share the same child relationships from Story down through the object graph) <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/rashid/archive/2009/02/12/domain-model-developing-kigg-v2-0-part-1.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">see diagram</a> .  The offending code is the way both repositories delete each others child entities:</p>

<p><b>CategoryRepository</b>
<code></p>

<pre><code>namespace Kigg.Repository.LinqToSql.CategoryRepository{
    //using statements omitted
    public class CategoryRepository : BaseRepository&lt;ICategory, Category&gt;, ICategoryRepository
    {
    //code omitted

    public override void Remove(ICategory entity)
    {
        Check.Argument.IsNotNull(entity, ""entity"");

        Category category = (Category) entity;

        Database.DeleteAll(Database.StoryViewDataSource.Where(v =&gt; v.Story.CategoryId == category.Id));
        Database.DeleteAll(Database.CommentSubscribtionDataSource.Where(cs =&gt; cs.Story.CategoryId == category.Id));
        Database.DeleteAll(Database.CommentDataSource.Where(c =&gt; c.Story.CategoryId == category.Id));
        Database.DeleteAll(Database.VoteDataSource.Where(v =&gt; v.Story.CategoryId == category.Id));
        Database.DeleteAll(Database.MarkAsSpamDataSource.Where(sp =&gt; sp.Story.CategoryId == category.Id));
        Database.DeleteAll(Database.StoryTagDataSource.Where(st =&gt; st.Story.CategoryId == category.Id));
        Database.DeleteAll(Database.StoryDataSource.Where(s =&gt; s.CategoryId == category.Id));

        base.Remove(category);
    }
}
}
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p><b>StoryRepository</b>
<code></p>

<pre><code>namespace Kigg.Repository.LinqToSql
{

    //using statements omitted


    public class StoryRepository : BaseRepository&lt;IStory, Story&gt;, IStoryRepository
    {

    //code omitted


    public override void Remove(IStory entity)
    {
        Check.Argument.IsNotNull(entity, ""entity"");

        Story story = (Story) entity;

        Database.DeleteAll(Database.StoryViewDataSource.Where(sv =&gt; sv.StoryId == story.Id));
        Database.DeleteAll(Database.CommentSubscribtionDataSource.Where(cs =&gt; cs.StoryId == story.Id));
        Database.DeleteAll(Database.CommentDataSource.Where(c =&gt; c.StoryId == story.Id));
        Database.DeleteAll(Database.VoteDataSource.Where(v =&gt; v.StoryId == story.Id));
        Database.DeleteAll(Database.MarkAsSpamDataSource.Where(sp =&gt; sp.StoryId == story.Id));
        Database.DeleteAll(Database.StoryTagDataSource.Where(st =&gt; st.StoryId == story.Id));

        base.Remove(story);
    }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>Would I be correct in assuming that a better design would have the <code>CategoryRepository</code> calling the <code>Remove</code> method on the <code>StoryRepository</code>, thereby delegating the concern for the Story's child object removal to the <code>StoryRepository</code> where it belongs?  From a maintenance point-of-view any additions to the Story's children would require <code>DeleteAll</code> calls to be added to both the <code>CategoryRepository</code> and the <code>StoryRepository</code>.</p>

<p>What would be a better implementation?</p>

<p>Should the <code>CategoryRepository</code> be refactored to use the <code>StoryRepository</code> directly?:
<b>CategoryRepository (refactor)</b>
<code></p>

<pre><code>namespace Kigg.Repository.LinqToSql.CategoryRepository{
    //using statements omitted
    public class CategoryRepository : BaseRepository&lt;ICategory, Category&gt;, ICategoryRepository
    {
    //code omitted

    public override void Remove(ICategory entity)
    {
        Check.Argument.IsNotNull(entity, ""entity"");

        Category category = (Category) entity;

        // refactor - start
        StoryRepository _storyRepository = new StoryRepository( Database );
        category.Stories.ForEach( story =&gt; _storyRepository.Remove( story ) );
        // refactor - end

        base.Remove(category);
    }
}
}
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>This refactor would allow the <code>CategoryRepository</code> to reuse the removal logic in the <code>StoryRepository</code> and should also reuse the same LinqToSql <code>DataContext</code> that is referenced by the <code>Database</code> argument given to the <code>StoryRepository</code> constructor.  But when it comes to unit testing it starts to have an odor.</p>

<p>Would a better refactor include using IoC (Kigg uses Unity as its Ioc container) to inject the <code>PerWebRequest</code> scoped instance of <code>IStoryRepository</code> into the <code>CategoryRepository</code>'s constructor? </p>

<p><b>CategoryRepository (refactor take 2)</b>
<code></p>

<pre><code>namespace Kigg.Repository.LinqToSql.CategoryRepository{
    //using statements omitted
    public class CategoryRepository : BaseRepository&lt;ICategory, Category&gt;, ICategoryRepository
    {


    private readonly IStoryRepository _storyRepository;

    public CategoryRepository(IDatabase database, IStoryRepository storyRepository) : base(database)
    {
        Check.Argument.IsNotNull(storyRepository, ""storyRepository"");
        _storyRepository = storyRepository;
    }

    public CategoryRepository(IDatabaseFactory factory, IStoryRepository storyRepository) : base(factory)
    {
        Check.Argument.IsNotNull(storyRepository, ""storyRepository"");
        _storyRepository = storyRepository;
    }

    //code omitted

    public override void Remove(ICategory entity)
    {
        {
        Check.Argument.IsNotNull(entity, ""entity"");

        Category category = (Category) entity;

        // refactor - start
        category.Stories.ForEach( story =&gt; _storyRepository.Remove( story ) );
        // refactor - end

        base.Remove(category);
    }
}
}
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>With this second refactor we can now inject an instance of <code>IStoryRepository</code> into <code>CategoryRepository</code> during unit testing and via Unity Ioc. Of course we would have to extend this refactor to each repository class so they could tend to their own children's responsibilites.</p>

<p>What are everyone's thoughts?</p>

<p>At the moment I'm using the following to fire them all, and call a callback once all Deferreds have resolved:</p>

<pre><code>$.when.apply(null, dataCalls)
   .always(callback);
</code></pre>

<p>It works fine. Now the problem is each Deferred in <code>dataCalls</code> fires off at the same time. how can I get them to fire in succession - I'm thinking about <code>Deferred.then</code>, and somehow <code>apply()</code> the array to <code>then()</code> but that assumes you have a Deferred to start off with, which I don't.</p>

<p>I'm thinking perhaps of looping through the array, and passing each Deferred object into the previous Deferred's <code>then()</code> method. Then follow with:</p>

<pre><code>$.when(dataCalls[0])
   .always(callback);
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>It's been a long day, let me clean up this question so it can be of use to someone else hopefully.</p>

<p>As opposed so what I first wrote, I actually have an array of <code>Deferred.promise()</code> objects, <code>dataCalls</code>.</p>

<p>This is then passed into:</p>

<pre><code>$.when.apply(null, dataCalls)
   .always(callback);
</code></pre>

<p>so that the callback is invoked when all of the promises are resolved.</p>

<p>Since the Deferred objects that return each promise have already been invoked, and (in other code not shown) that process is very fast, each Deferred runs concurrently.</p>

<p>To get the Deferreds firing in succession, I need to instead create an array with each object in the array being a function that returns the said promise.</p>

<p>I can then loop over the array, execute the function that returns the promise, then pass the next object in the array into the .then() method of the promise, which will cause the function to be invoked when the promise is resolved.</p>

<p>The last promise can then be passed back into <code>$.when(promise).always(callback);</code>.</p>

These minimum sizes are in ""dp"" units—the same units you should use when defining your layouts—which allows the system to avoid worrying about changes in screen density.</p>
  
  <p>xlarge screens are at least 960dp x 720dp<br>
  large screens are at least 640dp x 480dp<br>
  normal screens are at least 470dp x 320dp<br>
  small screens are at least 426dp x 320dp  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a second set of dimensions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Configuration examples</strong></p>
  
  <p>To help you target some of your designs for different types of devices, here are some numbers for typical screen widths:</p>
  
  <p>320dp: a typical phone screen (240x320 ldpi, 320x480 mdpi, 480x800 hdpi, etc).<br>
  480dp: a tweener tablet like the Streak (480x800 mdpi).<br>
  600dp: a 7” tablet (600x1024 mdpi).<br>
  720dp: a 10” tablet (720x1280 mdpi, 800x1280 mdpi, etc).  </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Why are there two sets of dimensions given?  </li>
<li>Why does the first set appear to have the width and height reversed?  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>What is actually occurring:</strong></p>

<p>The divider moves 100 pixels to the left but then stops and does not move on any subsequent firing on the setInterval function.</p>

<p>The image which fires the initial function:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById(""maindiv"").style.position = ""absolute"";
document.getElementById(""maindiv"").style.left = (document.getElementById(""maindiv"").style.left - 100);

<p>I know that the Interval is firing every second because I have an alert() running each time. (But the box moves once to the left and then not again(!)). </p>

"9812124","1","","","2012-03-21 20:13:28","","0","980","<p>I'm writing an app using PhoneGap/jQuery that fetches JSON data from a remote server. I've made two (roughly) equivalent ""getJSON"" functions, one using standard JavaScript, and another that uses jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>getJSON = function(url, callback) {
    var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
    request.open(""GET"", url, false);
    request.setRequestHeader(""If-Modified-Since"", ""Sat, 1 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT"");

    request.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (request.readyState != 4) {
            return;
        }

        if (request.status == 200) {
            callback(JSON.parse(request.responseText));
        } else {
            alert(""Error: "" + request.status);
        }
    }
    request.send(null);
};
</code></pre>

<p>The standard (though probably inelegant) function appears to work fine in all cases I've tried. However, the jQuery version:</p>

<pre><code>jqGetJSON = function(url, callback) {
    $.ajax(url, {
        cache: false,
        success: callback,
        error: function(jqxhr, message) {
            alert(""AJAX error: "" + message + "". Please retry."");
        }
    });
};
</code></pre>

<p>... only seems to work once. I called both like so:</p>

<pre><code>getJSON(""http://example.com/blah/json"", function(data) {
    alert(JSON.stringify(data));
}); // this works multiple times

jqGetJSON(""http://example.com/blah/json"", function(data) {
    alert(JSON.stringify(data);
}); // this succeeds

jqGetJSON(""http://example.com/blah/json"", function(data) {
    alert(JSON.stringify(data);
}); // this times out
</code></pre>

<p>The second call never returns, and adding a 'timeout' parameter to the jQuery options consistently calls the error function every time another request is made. There's also no console output of any kind that I've been able to find. Different jQuery requests to other URLs will work as well (e.g. separate ""search"" and ""get info"" requests), but again only once, and restarting the app fixes the problem.</p>

<p>I'm sure that I'm missing something obvious here, maybe someone more familiar with can offer some insight as to what it is?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>How do I push an action URL onto the value stack?</p>

<p>I've tried:</p>

<pre class=""lang-jsp prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;s:push value=""methodUrl""&gt;
  &lt;s:url action=""action"" method=""method"" /&gt;
&lt;/s:push&gt;

&lt;s:push value=""methodUrl""&gt;

&lt;s:push&gt;

&lt;/s:push&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>All the above fail without logging any errors even though I have <code>struts.devMode=true</code>.
Only the failure of the third option was truly expected since value is required for <code>s:push</code>.</p>

<p>Background:
I need to pass the URL to a JavaScript function that is in a separate <code>.js</code> file from a select tag like the following:</p>

<pre class=""lang-jsp prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;s:select name=""actionAttribute"" list=""attributeList""
          listKey=""key"" listValue=""value""
          onchange=""ajaxFunction('%{methodUrl}')"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I know that I can use <code>'&lt;s:url action=""action"" method=""method"" /&gt;'</code> in the JS function if the function is defined in my <code>.jsp</code> file, but that doesn't work when the JavaScript is in a different file.</p>

<p>As I typed the above paragraph I realized that I can define a JavaScript function in my JSP that will pass the URL to the <code>ajaxFunction</code>.</p>

<p>So now my question is purely academic.</p>

<p>Is there a way to <code>s:push</code> an <code>s:url</code> onto the value stack?</p>

<p>At successful login the symfony sends user to a specific controller where i wrote few codes to populate some additional data to session. It was working fine so far as we started application from login page so far. </p>

<p>But in some cases when we access some page which requires authentication, symfony force us to login page. after success login it takes us directly to that page (where we came from) instead landing page. In this cases the extra code we wrote on landing page is not getting executed, hence the app is not behaving as expected further. </p>

<p>My Question is to overcome this... is there any hook / setting / function present in symfony2 by which i can execute a set of code on all successful login irrespective of which page user is getting redirected.</p>

<p>So this program is out of my java textbook for school, the idea is there are 100 lockers all open now starting at the second locker close every 2nd one. (2,4,6,8,10) Then restarting at the second locker go through with every 3rd locker doing the same (opening a closed locker, or closing an open one). Now my third for-loop seems to be my issue it will not function for some reason, the second for-loop is included so when the third for-loop starts it goes through every 2nd locker then back to the second for-loop statement it increases ""num"" by 1 goes through ever 3rd then 4th and so on and so forth. i would like to  only use the basic commands i have learned so far in java and in the program now, so please help me solve this problem without really advanced coding. </p>

<p>The problem is that when i run the program the third for-loop is an infinite loop, i know the first two loops run fine, i tested that by after the second for-loop i made it output the ""num"" and it outputs all numbers 2 through 100 like i want but then the loop is endless at the third for-loop, not outputting anything else </p>

Normally, we have a MySQL backend, but for a few instances we need to use MS SQL to serve our clients. When performing our latest upgrade to one of these MS SQL instances, I began getting java out of memory errors when accessing certain pages of the web app. Usually occurring when returning a larger result set, but not always.</p>

<p>I do not receive this error on the same web app set-up as a local instance on my PC, which leads me to believe that this is an environment issue. I have tried numerous different Java settings in the Tomcat 6 configuration without any luck fixing the issue. </p>

<p>The environment is a 32-bit machine with 4GB of RAM. 
I have configured Tomcat 6 with the following:
-XX:MaxPermSize=512m
-Xnoclassgc
Initial memory pool: 1024
Maximum memory pool: 1024</p>

<p>I have also tried increasing the MaxPermSize, but this causes Tomcat to not be able to start.</p>

<p>As well, I have tried setting -Xms -Xmx, to 256m each, 512m each, etc.</p>

<p>My local machine is 64-bit with 4GB RAM.
I have configured Tomcat 6 with the following:
-XX:MaxPermSize=512m
-Xnoclassgc
Initial memory pool: 1024
Maximum memory pool: 1024</p>

<p>Could this be an issue with an SQL statement in the new upgrade? 
I don't don't believe this is the case because the error does not happen on my local instance. I believe it's environment related, but can't figure out the issue.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice?</p>

<p>Here is the logged error: </p>

<p>What this does is basically get's an inventory of certain items and does an aging analysis on them. However, the way the system works connected to this database there are some issues that need to be sorted out. This solution requires that a count on the serial number be made on the resultant dataset of this query and that count column be added in for the respective serial records.</p>

<p>Now the count bit is easy, and one solution I wrote is:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT     _bvSerialMasterFull.SerialNumber, COUNT(_bvSerialMasterFull.SerialNumber) AS SerialCount
FROM         _btblInvoiceLineSN INNER JOIN
                      _btblInvoiceLines ON _btblInvoiceLineSN.iSerialInvoiceLineID = _btblInvoiceLines.idInvoiceLines INNER JOIN
                      _bvSerialMasterFull INNER JOIN
                      _bvSerialNumbersFull ON _bvSerialMasterFull.SerialCounter = _bvSerialNumbersFull.SNLink INNER JOIN
                      WhseMst ON _bvSerialNumbersFull.SNWarehouseID = WhseMst.WhseLink ON 
                      _btblInvoiceLines.iStockCodeID = _bvSerialMasterFull.SNStockLink AND 
                      _btblInvoiceLineSN.cSerialNumber = _bvSerialMasterFull.SerialNumber INNER JOIN
                      StkItem ON _bvSerialMasterFull.SNStockLink = StkItem.StockLink
WHERE     (_bvSerialNumbersFull.SNTransType = 8) AND (_bvSerialMasterFull.CurrentLoc = 1) AND (StkItem.ItemGroup IN ('010', '020', '030', '040', '050', '060', 
                      '070', '080', '100', '150', '300', '400'))
GROUP BY _bvSerialMasterFull.SerialNumber`

Thus, using an inner join with the original query we can have:
`SELECT     Cnt.SerialCount, _bvSerialMasterFull.SerialNumber, _bvSerialMasterFull.SNStockLink, _bvSerialMasterFull.SNDateLMove, _bvSerialMasterFull.CurrentLoc, 
                      _bvSerialMasterFull.CurrentAccLink, _bvSerialMasterFull.StockCode, _bvSerialMasterFull.CurrentAccount, _bvSerialMasterFull.CurrentLocationDesc, 
                      _bvSerialNumbersFull.SNTxDate, _bvSerialNumbersFull.SNTxReference, _bvSerialNumbersFull.SNTrCodeID, _bvSerialNumbersFull.SNTransType, 
                      _bvSerialNumbersFull.SNWarehouseID, _bvSerialNumbersFull.TransAccount, _bvSerialNumbersFull.TransTypeDesc, 
                      _bvSerialNumbersFull.SerialNumber AS Expr1, _bvSerialNumbersFull.SNStockLink AS Expr2, _bvSerialNumbersFull.WarehouseCode, 
                      _bvSerialNumbersFull.TrCode, _bvSerialNumbersFull.CurrentLocationDesc AS Expr3, _bvSerialNumbersFull.CurrentAccount AS Expr5, 
                      WhseMst.Name, _btblInvoiceLineSN.cSerialNumber, _btblInvoiceLines.fUnitPriceExcl, StkItem.Code, StkItem.AveUCst, StkItem.ItemGroup

<p>However, as you can see, the original select query is run twice and joined together.</p>

<p>What I was hoping for is this to be done in the original query without the need to duplicate the original query. Can this be done? If so, your ideas, inputs and code is much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I'm trying to link against the <em>nedmalloc</em> dll exported library, I already linked it using <em>framework dependencies</em> and also including it in Additional Libraries. I also compiled the library using the <code>NEDMALLOC_DLL_EXPORTS</code> to ensure <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code> flag.</p>

These threads may call into another object that internally accesses a resources (socket). To prevent the resource to be accessed simultaneously, there is a critical section to get some order in the execution.</p>

<p>Now, when cancelling the thread, it (sometimes) happens that the thread is just within that code that is blocked by the critical section. The critical section is locked using an object and I was hoping that upon cancellation of the thread this object would be destructed and consequently release the lock. However this does not seem to be the case, so that at thread destruction this resource object is permanently locked.</p>

<p>Changing the resource object is probably not an option (3rd party delivered), plus it makes sense to prevent simultaneous access to a resource that can not be used in parallel.</p>

<p>I have experimented with preventing the thread to be cancelled using pthread_setcancelstate when the section is locked/unlocked, however this does feel a bit dirty and would not be a final solution for other situations (e.g. aquired mutexes, etc). </p>

<p>I know that a prefered solution would be to not use pthread_cancel but instead set a flag in the thread and it would cancel itself when it is ready (in a clean way). However as I want to cancel the thread asap, I was wondering (also out of academic interest) if there would be other options to do that. </p>

Using the samples from the Websharper website I'm able to run a simple Hello World page using sitelets when I hit Debug on Visual Studio. I'm wondering if there's a way to package this in such a way that I don't have to open the file in Visual Studio and hit debug to display the content? I've tried using msbuild from the command line to build the solution but I've had no luck opening the browser that way.

"962361","1","","","2009-06-07 17:28:56","","18","4287","<p>We have a rather specific application that uses PostgreSQL 8.3 as a storage backend (using Python and psycopg2). The operations we perform  to the important tables are in the majority of cases inserts or updates (rarely deletes or selects).</p>

<p>For sanity reasons we have created our own <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html"">Data Mapper</a>-like layer that works reasonably well, but it has one big bottleneck, the update performance. Of course, I'm not expecting the update/replace scenario to be as speedy as the 'insert to an empty table' one, but it would be nice to get a bit closer.</p>

<p>Note that this system is free from concurrent updates</p>

<p>We always set all the fields of each rows on an update, which can be seen in the terminology where I use the word 'replace' in my tests. I've so far tried two approaches to our update problem:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a <code>replace()</code> procedure that takes an array of rows to update:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION replace_item(data item[]) RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
    FOR i IN COALESCE(array_lower(data,1),0) .. COALESCE(array_upper(data,1),-1) LOOP
       UPDATE item SET a0=data[i].a0,a1=data[i].a1,a2=data[i].a2 WHERE key=data[i].key;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Create an <code>insert_or_replace</code> rule so that everything but the occasional delete becomes multi-row inserts</p>

<pre><code>CREATE RULE ""insert_or_replace"" AS
    ON INSERT TO ""item""
    WHERE EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM item WHERE key=NEW.key)
    DO INSTEAD
        (UPDATE item SET a0=NEW.a0,a1=NEW.a1,a2=NEW.a2 WHERE key=NEW.key);
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>These both speeds up the updates a fair bit, although the latter slows down inserts a bit: </p>

<pre><code>Multi-row insert           : 50000 items inserted in  1.32 seconds averaging 37807.84 items/s
executemany() update       : 50000 items updated  in 26.67 seconds averaging  1874.57 items/s
update_andres              : 50000 items updated  in  3.84 seconds averaging 13028.51 items/s
update_merlin83 (i/d/i)    : 50000 items updated  in  1.29 seconds averaging 38780.46 items/s
update_merlin83 (i/u)      : 50000 items updated  in  1.24 seconds averaging 40313.28 items/s
replace_item() procedure   : 50000 items replaced in  3.10 seconds averaging 16151.42 items/s
Multi-row insert_or_replace: 50000 items inserted in  2.73 seconds averaging 18296.30 items/s
Multi-row insert_or_replace: 50000 items replaced in  2.02 seconds averaging 24729.94 items/s
</code></pre>

<p>Random notes about the test run:</p>

<ul>
<li>All tests are run on the same computer as the database resides; connecting to localhost.</li>
<li>Inserts and updates are applied to the database in batches of of 500 items, each sent in its own transaction (<strong>UPDATED</strong>).</li>
<li>All update/replace tests used the same values as were already in the database.</li>
<li>All data was escaped using the psycopg2 adapt() function.</li>
<li>All tables are truncated and vacuumed before use (<strong>ADDED</strong>, in previous runs only truncation happened)</li>
<li><p>The table looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE item (
    key MACADDR PRIMARY KEY,
    a0 VARCHAR,
    a1 VARCHAR,
    a2 VARCHAR
)
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>So, the real question is: How can I speed up update/replace operations a bit more? (I think these findings might be 'good enough', but I don't want to give up without tapping the SO crowd :)</p>

<p>Also anyones hints towards a more elegant replace_item(), or evidence that my tests are completely broken would be most welcome.</p>

<p>The test script is available <a href=""http://fnord.se/perftest.py"">here</a> if you'd like to attempt to reproduce. Remember to check it first though...it WorksForMe, but...</p>

<p>You will need to edit the db.connect() line to suit your setup.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to andres in #postgresql @ freenode I have another test with a single-query update; much like a multi-row insert (listed as update_andres above).</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE item
SET a0=i.a0, a1=i.a1, a2=i.a2 
FROM (VALUES ('00:00:00:00:00:01', 'v0', 'v1', 'v2'), 
             ('00:00:00:00:00:02', 'v3', 'v4', 'v5'),
             ...
      ) AS i(key, a0, a1, a2)
WHERE item.key=i.key::macaddr
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to merlin83 in #postgresql @ freenode and jug/jwp below I have another test with an insert-to-temp/delete/insert approach (listed as ""update_merlin83 (i/d/i)"" above).</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO temp_item (key, a0, a1, a2)
    VALUES (
        ('00:00:00:00:00:01', 'v0', 'v1', 'v2'),
        ('00:00:00:00:00:02', 'v3', 'v4', 'v5'),
        ...);

DELETE FROM item
USING temp_item
WHERE item.key=temp_item.key;

INSERT INTO item (key, a0, a1, a2)
    SELECT key, a0, a1, a2
    FROM temp_item;
</code></pre>

<p>My gut feeling is that these tests are not very representative to the performance in the real-world scenario, but I think the differences are great enough to give an indication of the most promising approaches for further investigation. The perftest.py script contains all updates as well for those of you who want to check it out. It's fairly ugly though, so don't forget your goggles :)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>andres in #postgresql @ freenode pointed out that I should test with an insert-to-temp/update variant (listed as ""update_merlin83 (i/u)"" above).</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO temp_item (key, a0, a1, a2)
    VALUES (
        ('00:00:00:00:00:01', 'v0', 'v1', 'v2'),
        ('00:00:00:00:00:02', 'v3', 'v4', 'v5'),
        ...);

UPDATE item
SET a0=temp_item.a0, a1=temp_item.a1, a2=temp_item.a2
FROM temp_item
WHERE item.key=temp_item.key
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Probably final edit:
I changed my script to match our load scenario better, and it seems the numbers hold even when scaling things up a bit and adding some randomness. If anyone gets very different numbers from some other scenario I'd be interested in knowing about it.</p>

My update panel consists of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Three buttons</p></li>
<li><p>One image button</p></li>
<li><p>One link button</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So basically whats happening is, on my <code>Page_Load</code> event I am calling a method which fetches image url from 0 index of <code>DataRow</code>(That particular url has a uid associated with it). Then I press one of the three buttons to insert values into the database. Now when I click the Linkbutton to got to the next index of <code>DataRow</code>, it shows me the next image, but when I press any of the three buttons , it inserts the values from the 0 index of the DataRow (the default Page_Load values). What should I do to make by buttons fetch the next index values? I tried the view state, but I guess it doesn't work until your page load happens</p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
          Mutual(i1);
     }
                protected void Mutual(int j)
                    {
                        // DataRow Indexes accessed here
                    }
    protected void Button1_Click1(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
                // Insert query
        }
</code></pre>

<p>It seems the parameters are gathered to be sent to Docdata (as they take over with a secure payment site and they finish the payment sequence) but nothing happens. Now Docdata cannot solve this problem, or they are not willing to (it's a free module for Opencart), even from the developers (Taurosmedia) i don't get any feedback. The backend settings are all correct (on my site as well as backend Docdata). There are no error logs (at least i cannot find them).
I had a few people looking at this problem and only thing they come up with is a SOAP error.
As i am not familiar with Ajax and SOAP, i am totally stuck. Hope that someone can help me with this big issue, because the website cannot be run without this working.</p>

This has the consequences of bypassing my custom logging and also returning ugly views.</p>

<p>I have a similar approach to Darin's <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/4912456/729541"">answer</a> to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4911212/how-to-implement-proper-http-error-handling-in-net-mvc-2"">this question</a>.  Here's what I'm using at the moment.</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_Error(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var app = (MvcApplication)sender;
    var context = app.Context;
    var exception = app.Server.GetLastError();

    LogExceptionDetails(exception, Request.Url.PathAndQuery);

    context.Response.Clear();
    context.ClearError();

    string redirectTo = ""/error"";
    HttpException httpException = exception as HttpException;

    if (httpException != null)
    {
        switch (httpException.GetHttpCode())
        {
            case 403:
                redirectTo += ""/forbidden"";
                break;
            case 404:
                redirectTo += ""/notfound"";
                break;
        }
    }

    Response.TrySkipIisCustomErrors = true;

    // I should really change this so I can return a proper statusCode
    Response.Redirect(redirectTo);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As an example, navigating to <code>localhost/app_code</code> will return an ugly view and won't be logged.  I have managed to at least make IIS return my custom views by using:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;httpErrors errorMode=""Custom"" existingResponse=""Replace""&gt;
    &lt;remove statusCode=""403"" /&gt;
    &lt;error statusCode=""403"" path=""/error/forbidden"" responseMode=""ExecuteURL"" /&gt;
    &lt;remove statusCode=""404"" /&gt;
    &lt;error statusCode=""404"" path=""/error/notfound"" responseMode=""ExecuteURL"" /&gt;
&lt;/httpErrors&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That doesn't solve the logging problem though.</p>

<p>Other things I've tried include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Setting <code>existingResponse=""PassThrough""</code>.</li>
<li>Using <code>&lt;clear /&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Various combinations of <code>httpErrors</code> with and without <code>customErrors</code>.</li>

<li><code>Response.TrySkipIisCustomErrors = true;</code></li>

<p>First of all, I am running Mac OS X 10.9.4 (Mavericks) which is unfortunately 64 bit only. I've been tasked with porting some 32 bit code over to this computer (used to work on OS X 10.6.8), but it has been a real hassle. The 32 bit code is poorly written (heavily centered around 32 bit memory allocation) and I don't really have time to go fix all the errors (let alone find them). No, I did not write this code, someone else from my group did several years ago (and he is gone). Necessary are the boost libraries.</p>

<p>As a thought for a solution I thought I might be able to compile the program in 32 bit mode. I'm using Code::Blocks as an IDE if that matters, and gcc 4.4.</p>

<p>I've installed boost libraries (v 1.44) as 32 bit by using </p>

<pre><code>sudo ./bjam cxxflags=""-m32"" 
</code></pre>

<p>when installing. The little test program I am using is from the boost website:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;boost/regex.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main()
{
    std::string line;
    boost::regex pat( ""^Subject: (Re: |Aw: )*(.*)"" );

    while (std::cin)
    {
        std::getline(std::cin, line);
        boost::smatch matches;
        if (boost::regex_match(line, matches, pat))
            std::cout &lt;&lt; matches[2] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to compile (with -m32 flag), a warning pops up saying that the library in </p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/boost_1_44_0/stage/lib/libboost_regex.a
</code></pre>

<p>was built for archive which is not the architecture being linked (x86_64). Similar warning for the main.o file.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering, how can I get this code to compile on a 64 bit computer?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<pre><code>    public INode RootNode

            return this.Context.Session[""RootNode""] as INode;

<p>This usually works fine.  I've discovered that sometimes, the context.session variable will be null.  </p>

<p>I'd like to know what are the conditions that cause the session to be null in the first place, and whats the best way to persist my object when this happens? Can I just assign a new HttpSessionState object to the context, or does that screw things up?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:  Ok, so its not just the session that is null... the whole context is screwed up.  When the webpart enters the init, the context is fine... but when it reaches the dropbox selectedindexchange postback event (the dropbox contains node id's to use to set the rootnode variable), the context contains mostly null properties.</p>

<p>also, it only seems to happen when certain id's are selected.  This looks more like some kind of weird bug on my end than a problem with my understanding of the session.</p>

<p>I've got a SSRS report that runs 2 stored procedures. Each of these stored procedures take between 2-4 minutes to run when they are run through Management Studio.</p>

<p>I have subscriptions setup to run this report with different parameter values every day. Each day 5 copies of this report are supposed to be generated, each generated with a different parameter value. Today 3 of the 5 subscriptions failed. The error I see in the log for each failure today is:</p>

<pre><code>Microsoft.ReportingServices.ReportProcessing.ReportProcessingException: Cannot read the next data row for the dataset SectionLines.
</code></pre>

<p>When I look at the execution log in the report server DB, I see the TimeDataRetrieval value for the failed reports are > 3600000. This is strange, given the stored procedures only take a few minutes to run each, and definitely no more than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Any clues for troubleshooting this?</p>

I need to save my longtime cookie to later connections.</p>

<p>Sadly I can't use <a href=""http://loopj.com/android-async-http/"">http://loopj.com/android-async-http/</a> and it's PersistentCookieStore because I need to allow an untrusted certificate (using <a href=""http://abhinavasblog.blogspot.se/2011/07/allow-untrusted-certificate-for-https.html"">http://abhinavasblog.blogspot.se/2011/07/allow-untrusted-certificate-for-https.html</a>). I've tried using their PersistentCookieStore alone but they are using apache cookies and I'm using java.net cookies...</p>

<p>This is what I've tried:</p>

<pre><code>cManager = new CookieManager(null, CookiePolicy.ACCEPT_ALL);

private void setSharedPreferences(){
List&lt;HttpCookie&gt; cookies = cManager.getCookieStore().getCookies();

if (cookies.isEmpty()) {
       Log.d(tag,""no cookies received"");
    } else {
       for (int i = 0; i &lt; cookies.size(); i++) {
           if(cookies.get(i).getName().equals(""rememberMe"")){
               editor.putString(""rememberMe"", cookies.get(i).toString());
               editor.commit();
           }
       }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And when I'm retrieving the cookie on next app launch:</p>

<pre><code>    SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = context.getSharedPreferences(""PREF_NAME"", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
    editor = sharedPreferences.edit();
    String rememberString = sharedPreferences.getString(""rememberMe"", ""none"");

    if (!rememberString.equals(""none"")) {
        Log.d(""rememberME är inte"", ""none!"");
        URI uriToCookie = null;
        try {
            uriToCookie = new URI(""https://myservername.com"");
        } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        List&lt;HttpCookie&gt; cookieList = HttpCookie.parse(rememberString);
        cManager.getCookieStore().add(uriToCookie, cookieList.get(0));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The cookie is added to cManager but is not recognized by the server.. I believe there is some sort of parse problem. Anyone got the solution?</p>

<p>Which is basically a series. I have a (1x20) numpy array, as follows: </p>

<pre><code>array([[ 1308.22000654,  -920.02730748,  1285.54273707, -1119.67498439,

</code></pre>

<p>Now what I want is that for each cell value of this top row of df data frame, I need to check if the sign of that cell is same as that of the corresponding cell sign of the above numpy array. If the sign is different then for all the rows in df, for that corresponding co-ordinate, flip the signs of each corresponding co-ordinate value in df. For ex. if you see the first cell value. Df has -1387 while numpy array has 1380. So now the first column of df frame should have it's sign reversed. Same with other columns. </p>

<p>I am doing it using a for loop. 
 Like </p>

<pre><code>for x in range(20):
   if(np.sign(Y1[0][x])!=np.sign(df.ix[0][x])):
       if(np.sign(Y1[0][x])==0 and np.sign(df.ix[0][x]&gt;0)):
          df[x]=df[x]*1
       else: 
          df[x]=df[x]*(-1)
</code></pre>

<p>I also need to make sure that if np.sign(Y[x])=0 then the sign which it takes is not zero but +1. I can add that condition in the above code, but point is how to make it more pythonic?. </p>

<p>EDIT: I have added the code which I wrote which seems to work fine and flip the signs of df column based on the conditions mentioned above. ANy idea how to do this in pythonic way?</p>

<p>EDITII: I have one more doubt. My numpy array is supposed to be single dimensional. But as you see above it is coming as 2 dimensional and I have to unnecessarily access the cell by 2 indexes. Why is that?. This is how I created numpy array(Dot product of two 1x11025 row of a df with 11025x20 matrix giving 1x20 array. But it is coming as array of array as you see above. code to create numpy array: </p>

<pre><code>Y1=np.dot(X_smilie_norm[0:1],W)
</code></pre>

<p>X_smilie_norm is a 28x11025 pandas dataframe. I am accessing just the first row of that and doing a dot product with W which is a 11025x20 matrix. It is giving a double dimensional array when all I want is a single dimensional so that I could access Y1 values just with single index. </p>

<p>sku, total, value
sku, total, value
sku, total, value</p>

<p>Is there a way so that after 14 lines of data have been entered into this csv, to write into the php so that it then rewrites over the first line, then the second line, then the third, without deleting the remaining data?
I was thinking maybe to do a count for the amount of lines, if it is less than 14, continue writing, if it is equal to 14, write over. I am not sure this is possible, or even how to go about this, i'm pretty new to PHP.</p>

<p>Having said that, I want to create an OS image of QNX 6.6.0 to put on a Compact Flash card. This card is plugged in an USB adapter which is connected to my host pc. I'm running Neutrino in a VM (VMware/VirtualBox) for which I enabled USB support. Generally, the adapter works fine under Win (current host) and Linux.</p>

<p>The (apparently out-dated) tutorial I was following stated to search for devices named <code>umass*</code> or <code>hd*</code> after connecting the USB adapter. But there aren't any (except for hd0).</p>

<p>See also ""ls /dev"" <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/8vqwD.png"" rel=""nofollow"">screenshot</a>.</p>

<p>The processes <code>devb-umass</code> and <code>io-usb</code> are running. So I expect that the adapter is detected automatically.</p>

<p>Any suggestions what went wrong?</p>

<p><code>http://server/DEV/Project/trunk</code><br>
<code>http://server/DEV/Project/branches</code></p>

<p>I then branch off with the following command:</p>

<p><code>svn copy -m ""message"" ""http://server/DEV/Project/trunk@123"" ""http://server/DEV/Project/branches/rel123""</code></p>

<p>Everything works great, and the content of <code>/trunk@123</code> is placed under the new branch path <code>/branches/rel123</code>. All good.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Added : /DEV/Project/branches/rel123 (Copy from path: /DEV/Project/trunk, Revision, 123)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The problem:</h2>

<p>If someone accidentally executes the branch off <strong>again</strong>, I <strong>expect</strong> it to fail with <em>""svn: E160020: Path 'rel123' already exists""</em>. <strong>However it does not fail.</strong></p>

<p>Repeating the same <code>svn copy</code> command in-fact copies the <code>/trunk</code> to <code>/branches/rel123/trunk</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Added : /DEV/Project/branches/rel123/trunk (Copy from path: /DEV/Project/trunk, Revision, 123)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now, I end up with <code>/branches/rel123</code> that contains all the files off the trunk, plus the <strong>extra</strong> folder ""trunk"" (<code>/branches/rel123/trunk</code>) that also contains all the same files off the trunk.</p>

<h2>I have tried:</h2>

<p>I've tried terminating the paths to force SVN to understand this is the absolute directory name, but no luck (i've stripped out <code>http://server</code> part in below examples)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>svn copy -m ""message"" ""/DEV/Project/trunk@123<b>/</b>"" ""/DEV/Project/branches/rel123""<br>
  svn copy -m ""message"" ""/DEV/Project/trunk<b>/</b>@123"" ""/DEV/Project/branches/rel123""<br>

I am trying to use mlabwrap to directly call Matlab functions from Python, rather than open up a subprocess and run the Matlab file from the shell.</p>

<p>Mlabwrap seems to be correctly installed; when I start up the Python shell, I type in:</p>

<pre><code>from mlabwrap import mlab
mlab.path(mlab.path(), matlabFuncPath)
mlab.myMatlabFunc(arg1, arg2, arg3) # Example

<p>This works correctly. However, when the server runs this in function on the Celery task queue, it breaks and throws an error.</p>

<p>This happens for any mlabwrap function I am calling on the task queue. Mlabwrap has really bad documentation, so I can't find resources to help. It also seems like the only good way, at this point, to effectively call Matlab functions from Python. I could use subprocess, but it's slow and has other disadvantages (I have to save values and figures in files, rather than directly access them). Why would mlabwrap work in Python from the shell, but not in Celery?</p>

<p>I was entertaining the possibility of writing all of the business logic in JS and then the primary UI components with Cocoa and .NET respectively, but I got to thinking that it would be nice if there were something already in place that would facilitate such a workflow without having to support a few different codebases.  </p>

<p>After researching this a bit, I obviously became overwhelmed with the solutions that seem to exist for iOS development, however hitherto I've found nothing that really seems to also work on OS X.  Are there any solutions that I may be overlooking?  If not, what might be the recommended path for basing most business logic in a JavaScript app and interfacing with that for the native UI components?</p>

I'm letting the user change some arguments in the url in another viewController(secondViewController). </p>

<p>I'm presenting this second view controller to let the user do this.
When he is done (he is clicking the 'done' button and calling dismissViewControllerAnimated),
I would like to get the url-changes and load it to the view controllers webView. But the webView seems to not be loaded.... thats the problem.</p>

<p>Here's an example.</p>

    [sheet showInView:self.view];//this sheet test will not show, the app will crash:'Sheet can not be presented because the view is not in a window:.......'
}
-(void)openURL:(NSURL *)url {
    NSMutableURLRequest *request = [[NSMutableURLRequest alloc] initWithURL:url];

    NSLog(@""Trying to open %@ in webbrowser"", url);

    [webView loadRequest:request];

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>secondViewController.h:</strong></p>

<pre><code>.......
#import ""FirstController.h""
.......
@interface SecondViewController : UIViewController {

.......
}
.......
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *OLDurlInWebView;

<p><strong>secondViewController.m:</strong></p>

<pre><code>@synthesize OLDurlInWebView;

    [wb view];
    [wb loadView]; //testing everything, nothing works
    [wb view];

    [wb performSelector:@selector(showInView:) withObject:newurl afterDelay:5];//the webView will not load after 5 seconds. Why?
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, from the beginning:</p>

<p><strong>In firstViewController:</strong></p>

<p>I'm presenting the secondviewcontroller.</p>

<p><strong>Now we are in secondViewController:</strong></p>

<p>The user will now change the url, but in this example, he will change the url to facebook.com.</p>

<p>Now we are going to send back this new url (facebook.com) to the firstViewController. The user 
clicks the doneButton and dismissViewControllerAnimated will be called.</p>

<p><strong>In attempt to get back to the firstViewController with this new url(facebook).</strong></p>

<p>I have tested everything I know, which is not enough. I have tested to call a normal function in firstViewController from secondViewController. The webView will not be able to load requests.</p>

<p>Then i tested to put the code in viewDidDisappear and giving the view 5 seconds to load, but it doesn't work.</p>

<p>I had this problem a time ago when the my app handles a URL Scheme Link in app delegate.
<strong>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application handleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url</strong>
for example if you wan't to load another webView/label with a url or text from the URL scheme link?
how to do this from app delegate? this is the same problem as above.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong/what do I dont know?
How to 'wait' for the view to load and then be able to load for example a webView with a url.?</p>

<p>How do I install 2 working versions of the same application on 1 PC?</p>

It's supposed to be able to handle quotation marks around phrases, so that a search for <code>test case</code> will return documents with both test and case, whereas a search for <code>""test case""</code> should return documents with the phrase test case.</p>

<p>However, I've been pulling my hair out over this, because it seems like Rails is stripping out any outer quotation marks from user inputs before it even hits the search engine. Thus <code>""test case""</code> returns the exact same results as <code>test case</code> but <code>""""test case""""</code> or <code>""test case""</code> (with leading and trailing spaces) actually works, in the first case because the outer quotation marks are stripped away leaving the inner ones, and in the second case because this problem only affects leading and trailing quotation marks.</p>

<p>Apparently, this is a known bug and <a href=""https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/4576-rails-escapes-quotes-at-when-they-are-at-beginning-and-and-of-signle-line-string"" rel=""nofollow"">has been marked as won't fix</a> by the Rails team.

<p>I was recently making a game application using Xcode 6.4 which worked perfectly in IOS devices. However, when I upload Xcode 7 Beta 4 to develop my app for IOS 9 there was a problem.</p>

<p>I was using this code in Xcode 6, which was restricting my hero to flip between -1.0 and 1.0 in X-axes, my hero could not flipping to -2.0 :</p>

<pre><code>func flip() {
        isUpsideDown = !isUpsideDown

        var scale: CGFloat!
        if isUpsideDown {
            scale = -1.0
        } else {
            scale = 1.0
        }
        let translate = SKAction.moveByX(0, y: scale*(size.height + kMLGroundHeight), duration: 0.1)
        let flip = SKAction.scaleYTo(scale, duration: 0.1)

        runAction(translate)
        runAction(flip)
    }
</code></pre>

<p>But now in Xcode 7 this cod seems to not work. Firstly it seems alright but then hero starts to flip to -2.0, -3.0 and this goes on until the hero goes out of frame.</p>

<p>Also this is my game scene cod which worked perfectly on Xcode 6:</p>

<pre><code>  override func touchesBegan(touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, withEvent event: UIEvent?) {

        if isGameOver {

            restart()

        } else if !isStarted {

In my situation, I am using FF 38.0.5(which is latest as of the time of writing this question).</p>

<p>As per <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a"" rel=""nofollow"">MDN</a>, it clearly says that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Firefox 20 this attribute is only honored for links to resources
  with the same-origin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that it says ""In Firefox 20"" and not ""In Firefox 20 <strong>Onwards</strong>""
So it should not be the case in firefox 38.0.5.</p>

<p>Actually I have created a mashup widget for a third party website, so all the anchor links are of different domains. Its like an embedded html frame. </p>

<p>If I go for the proposed solution in the above SO question's answer(which deals with only image files), I would have to put the content type of each file and that would be very cumbersome as we would have to consider n different types of files. </p>

<p>So is there a way to get round this problem so that the cross domain anchors work in firefox(as well as chrome)?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
In my case, the anchors are opening file in that frame instead of downloading that particular file.</p>

  {}
};

int main(int argc,const char** argv)
{
   Worker  m;
   return( 0 );
}
</code></pre>

<p>The intent is to make <em>Worker</em>'s <em>myErrorHandler</em>() accept the object which generated the callback along with an arbitrary integer value. Truth to tell, this is a simplified version of an asio callback handler, but I took out the asio for the sake of brevity.</p>

<p>The compiler complains about the *typedef...callback_t* inside the template, saying:</p>

<pre><code>../src/templates.cpp:13: error: a call to a constructor cannot appear in a constant-expression
../src/templates.cpp:13: error: template argument 1 is invalid
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried trivial hints by placing typename in this definition of callback_t, but nothing gets past this problem.</p>

<p>In the end I want a 3rd class to be able to have 1 to many objects that look like Derived class instances, each getting their callback in Worker. I want the template to be baseclass to Derived so the object can ctor/dtor and construct its callback.  </p>

<p>Am I missing something in my definition of callback_t?</p>

<p>***EDIT UPDATE:</p>

<p>The above code will now compile;  many thanks for the suggestions.</p>

<p>I added the boost::asio tag even though the above code has had the asio completely removed.  The template/class will model an asio timer-wrapper that can hide and manage its own attributes.  My protocol completion handler (which can have multiple state timers) will be a bit simpler to read, and places where timer code is identical, but hitherto copy/pasted, will refactor into common classes and be inherited. </p>

<p>This key is then passed to the server as a header. it is Base64 encoded using this function:</p>

    } catch (Exception e) {

    }

    return key;

<p>To debug this, I put breakpoints after both the key generation on the client side, and just before the cipher.init on the server side. According to Netbeans, the bytes that make up the SecretKeys are identical and are 16 bytes in length (In fact, as far as I can tell, the objects are identical).</p>

<p>I’ll try to explain in words.  </p>

<p>By creating t2 as the minimum of the three dates, odate, rdate and ddate, and as all three date vectors always have the same length, t2 will have the same length as the three dates.</p>

<p>The two lines that give the warnings are the next part of the structure of the vector.  If there is no ddate, but there is an rdate and it’s less than the end date, this rdate should be the value for this position in the vector t2.  Similarly, if there is no rdate, but there is a ddate and it’s less than the end date, ddate should be the value for the position in the vector.</p>

<p>The three lines that make t2 equal to the end.date under various conditions all work fine.  </p>

<p>Finally, the last line “zeroes” the dates if they fall outside the start and end dates, overriding any previous values if necessary.</p>

<p>The logic vector created by “is.na(ddate) &amp; !is.na(rdate) &amp; rdate &lt;= end.year“ has 11 elements as do the rdate and ddate vectors, so what I thought would happen is that when the logic was true, the value from this index in rdate would be taken by t2, but clearly not.</p>

job.setPrintService(docPrintJob.getPrintService());

Book book = new Book();//java.awt.print.Book
book.append(SimpleDocConvertedToPrintable, pf);
job.setPageable(book);

job.print();

<p>Unfortunately, I can not get this to work. I also thought of setting the custom MediaSize from within the <code>HashPrintRequestAttributeSet</code>, but I could not find it anywhere.</p>

<p>So my question is: how can I create a custom MediaSize, or is there maybe a better and quicker way to print a PDF without saving it to a file?</p>

into representations of graphs, the representation with 
objects&amp;pointers 
is favorable to the adjacency-list representation and adjacency-matrix representation 
when the graph is a tree of type 
n-ary, binary (ordinary binary, balanced-- red-black, AVL, etc) trie, b-tree, ... , and obviously not a heap. 
This is because:</p>

<p>1.) in a tree structure, the edges have distinct meanings-- ""left-child"", 
""right-child"", ""parent"", ""i-th child"" in b-trees, 
the link value in tries/radix trees, etc. 
Tree operations require the traversal of a specific link-- based on the link types 
(left-,  right-, .. i-th-child, etc). 
The use of pointers can easily allow to distinguish the link types. 
Adjacency list representation would require an extra field on the 
link-node to tell what kind of a link it is. 
Matrix representation would require coded matrix entries to tell what kind of a link it is. </p>

<p>2.) Tree operations often require moving around the subtrees of a node. 
This can easily be done, 
in constant time, by changing the pointer values. 
In an adjacency list and matrix representations, 
this operation would take searching for the link-to-be altered 
in the edge-list of the nodes and is linear in the number of edges or the graph degree-- no longer in O(1). </p>

<p>The object&amp;pointer representation of a tree can be backed by array structures:
So, each vertex is 
still represented by an object. This object has a pointer to each child and one 
to the parent (whichever the way the tree being implemented calls for). 
But this time, the objects are array entries, and the pointer values are array indices. This is a mix of adjacency-list and objects&amp;pointers representations of graphs 
and is powerful. </p>

<p>My Q is: What other general cases are there in the representations of graphs 
where the representation with objects&amp;pointers is preferable to the adjacency-list 
representation and to the the adjacency-matrix<br>
representation?</p>

<p>I'm looking for references to this. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>here goes:</p>

<p>I have a generic interface:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public interface IMyInterface&lt;TFoo, TBar&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have a bunch of classes that implement this interface</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>class MyImpl1 : IMyInterface&lt;string, bool&gt; { }
class MyImpl2 : IMyInterface&lt;bool, string&gt; { }
class MyImpl3 : IMyInterface&lt;bool, string&gt; { }
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I have a decorator:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>class MyDecorator&lt;TFoo, TBar&gt; : IMyInterface&lt;TFoo, TBar&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I only want to ""Decorate"" the implementations (of <code>MyInterface</code>) that have a particular attribute. So all implementations of MyInterface that have an Attribute of <code>[MyAttribute]</code> 
are decorated with MyDecorator.</p>

<p>I'm close but no cigar yet:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var builder = new ContainerBuilder();        

builder.RegisterAssemblyTypes(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly())
    .Where(type =&gt; type.GetCustomAttributes(true)
        .Any(attr =&gt; attr.GetType() == typeof(MyAttribute)))
    .AsClosedTypesOf(typeof (IMyInterface&lt;,&gt;))
    .Keyed(""CachableQueries"", typeof(IMyInterface&lt;,&gt;));

builder.RegisterGenericDecorator(typeof(MyDecorator&lt;,&gt;),
    typeof(IMyInterface&lt;,&gt;), ""CachableQueries"");

var container = builder.Build();

Console.WriteLine(container.Resolve&lt;IMyInterface&lt;string,bool&gt;&gt;());
Console.WriteLine(container.Resolve&lt;IMyInterface&lt;bool,bool&gt;&gt;());
</code></pre>

<p>I understand that the final piece of the puzzle is the Key, it actually need to pass the type into the <code>Keyed(""CachableQueries"", THE_TYPE);</code> but its not playing ball.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>nemesv sent me in the right direction. </p>

<p>As part of my question, I forgot to mention that I also needed to register all the implementations of IMyInterface&lt;,> that didn't have the [MyAttribute].</p>

<p>I did this in two stages. First Register the types with the Decorator and then register the rest.</p>

<p>My Solution:
I know it needs refactoring, but as a proof of concept. it works.</p>

<p><code>
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var builder = new ContainerBuilder();</p>

                .Any(i =&gt; i.IsGenericType &amp;&amp; i.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == typeof (IMyInterface&lt;,&gt;))).ToList();

    //Even tho the decorator inherits IMyInterface (we don't want to process it)
    typesToQuery.Remove(typeof (MyDecorator&lt;,&gt;)); 


    //build a dictionary of all the types, so we don't process them again.
    Dictionary&lt;Type, bool&gt; typesToProcess = typesToQuery.ToDictionary(queryType =&gt; queryType, queryType =&gt; false);


    //Register all types that have [MyAttribute]
    foreach (var type in typesToQuery
                .Where(type =&gt; type.GetCustomAttributes(true)
                .Any(attr =&gt; attr.GetType() == (typeof(MyAttribute)))))
    {
        builder.RegisterType(type).Keyed(""CachableQueries"",

                        i.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == typeof(IMyInterface&lt;,&gt;)));

        typesToProcess[type] = true; //update, so this type isn't processed again
    }

    //Decorate the correct ones
    builder.RegisterGenericDecorator(typeof(MyDecorator&lt;,&gt;), typeof(IMyInterface&lt;,&gt;), fromKey: ""CachableQueries"");

    //Register the rest of the types we're interested 
    foreach (Type type in typesToProcess.Where(kvp =&gt; kvp.Value == false).Select(pair =&gt; pair.Key))
    {
        builder.RegisterType(type).As(

    } 

    var container = builder.Build();

    Console.WriteLine(container.Resolve&lt;IMyInterface&lt;string, bool&gt;&gt;());
    Console.WriteLine(container.Resolve&lt;IMyInterface&lt;bool, bool&gt;&gt;());

<p>I can call a number and answer the phone but I don't know how to achieve live voice(to be able to talk) connection instead of just playing music.</p>

<p>I created an action method inside <code>HomeController</code>:</p>

            client = new TwilioRestClient(Settings.AccountSid, Settings.AuthToken); 

            var result = client.InitiateOutboundCall(Settings.TwilioNumber, to, ""http://twimlets.com/message?Message%5B0%5D=http://demo.kevinwhinnery.com/audio/zelda.mp3""); //it causes to play zelda theme when call is answered by callee

            if (result.RestException != null) {
                return new System.Web.Mvc.HttpStatusCodeResult(500, result.RestException.Message);

        }

 public ActionResult Index() {
            return View();
        }
</code></pre>

<p>This action method is invoked by Ajax call.</p>

<p>When I hit the button from <code>Views\Home\Index.csthml</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;form&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enter your mobile phone number:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;input id=""to"" type=""text""
               placeholder=""ex: +16518675309"" /&gt;
        &lt;button&gt;Send me a message&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The script below is invoked which passes the phone number from <code>&lt;input id=""to""&gt;</code> to the action method <code>public ActionResult Call(string to)</code> in the <code>HomeController</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$('form button').on('click', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    // expect just a string of text back from the server 
    var url = '/call'; 
    $.ajax(url, { //invokes call action method
        method:'POST',
        dataType:'text',
        data:{
            to:$('#to').val()//passes the number argument to the action method
        },
        success: function(data) {
            showFlash(data);
        },
        error: function(jqxhr) {
            alert('There was an error sending a request to the server');
        }
    })
});
</code></pre>

<p>This starts phone call to the specified number i.e. <code>48123456789</code> where <code>48</code> is the country code. When the call is answered by the callee, the zelda theme is played.( <a href=""http://twimlets.com/message?Message%5B0%5D=http://demo.kevinwhinnery.com/audio/zelda.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twimlets.com/message?Message%5B0%5D=http://demo.kevinwhinnery.com/audio/zelda.mp3</a> )</p>

<p>Instead of that I would like to talk through notebook(it has internal microphone) to the person I've called and let this person talk back. In few words I would like to have live voice.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How to achieve live voice phone call using Twilio in ASP.NET-MVC 5.x?</p>

<p>So, what am I doing wrong?  Should I be passing something other than {{{users.models}} to the template?  Am I looping through that stucture incorrectly?</p>

The spinner's selected items are used to form a web service URL which is called when the button is clicked and the response is shown in the list view.</p>

<p>The issue is if the user views the app in portrait mode, chooses a date, chooses an hour and clicks the button, the response of the web service call is shown in the list view however, if the device is rotated to landscape then the data in the list view is gone (because in order to get it there a button click is needed).</p>

<p>Basically I want to use Multicast for my application and I want don't want to impose any restriction of changing router for configuring custom protocol to handle UDP in reliable way , for example I was thinking for implementing/using PGM protocol over UDP to handle multicast but someone said that router should also have support for PGM which restricts me in providing solution since customers should change infrastructure for my solution which is unwarranted. </p>

<p>Please let me know if there is any solution which I can implement to handle UDP packets in reliable way without any changes to network infrastructure.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I don't mean to say that I don't want to enable multicast in router, I would definitely enable multicast routing in router. When I read about PGM implementation some one said even router should be PGM capable which I thought is different router than commercially available routers in stores.

<pre><code>=($C16*$C$22)+($D16*$D$22)+($E16*$E$22)+($F16*$F$22)+($G16*$G$22)+($H16*$H$22)+($I16*$I$22)
</code></pre>

<p>However, I can't see how a specific formula could be causing an error for sorting when the values it is returning are correct and seem fine to be ordered.</p>

<p>Does anybody have any thoughts on what could be triggering this problem or if there was another way to sort to avoid the error?</p>

<p>In other words - I'm creating a type that represents a graph. Nodes can be normal, or virtual, const and non-const. A Graph can contain a single node, or a node and a branch of graphs. </p>

<p>When I create a function <code>f</code> I want it to be const-neutral (do the same stuff on a const and non-const version of a node in a graph, but different on branched and unbranched graphs). Do I have to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Duplicate the code?</li>
<li><p>Use <code>std::enable_if</code> hack?</p>

<ol>
<li>Duplication of code duplicates bugs, so it is not optimal.</li>
<li>std::enable_if produces bad error messages in my case.</li>
</ol></li>

<p>Is there a smarter solution to the problem that will make <code>f</code> accept const and non-const nodes?</p>

            newPost = Post(actualPost = form.cleaned_data['actualPost'])
</code></pre>

<p>So basically in the view, after getting the string version of the users input / post, I plan on sending that string to a function called findLinks. This is the findLinks function:</p>

<pre><code>def findLinks(postString):
    word = ''
    totalLength = len(postString)
    for i in postString:
        if i=='@': #basically, I want anything after an '@' sign to be a link..

                 word += htmlString[indexOfSign+1]
                 indexOfSign += 1
    return word

<p>The function does return the word after the '@' sign. So now that it returns the word after the @ sign, how I do safely make that word a link so that when I put the post in a template, then when I view the template, the word after the @ sign will appear as a link?</p>

<p>One possible way I was thinking was, in the python function, basically return the string version of the post except with the word after the @ sign wrapped around with """" and """", but this will not work because for safety reasons, Django interprets user input as a raw string rather than code, correct?</p>

<p>I don't want to force Django to interpret Post's as code rather than raw string because that will cause security issues. Is there any way for me to safely take the users input and save it to the database and in the template, make all words which come after the '@' sign a link?</p>

<p>And I tried to write regex myself to solve it, but it seems a too much huge project.</p>

<p>Any recommendations on this?</p>

The problem is that these layouts are stored in three different layout resource files (layout1.xml, layout2.xml and layout3.xml) and instead of them I want to create the content for each screen dynamically.</p>

<p>This is an excerpt of the Adapater that states the content of each page:</p>

<pre><code>   public Object instantiateItem(View collection, int position) {
        LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater) collection.getContext()
                .getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
        int resId = 0;
        switch (position) {
        case 0:
            resId = R.layout.layout1;
            break;
        case 1:
            resId = R.layout.layout2;
            break;
        case 2:
            resId = R.layout.layout3;
            break;
        }
        View view = inflater.inflate(resId, null);
        ((ViewPager) collection).addView(view, 0);
        return view;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>How can I create a simple layout programatically and place it in one of my screens? I've been working on this a lot and cannot find any clues on how to do it, any info pointing me in the right direction will be useful.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>This is what I am trying now, I don't think I'm very far off, however all screens are blank:</p>

<pre><code>Context context = collection.getContext();
LinearLayout layout = new LinearLayout(context);
TextView view = new TextView(context);
switch (position) {
    case 0:
       view.setText(""some text"");
       view.setPadding(5, 5, 5, 5);
       view.setLayoutParams(new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));
       break;
    case 1:
       view.setText(""some text"");
       view.setPadding(5, 5, 5, 5);
       view.setLayoutParams(new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));
       break;
    case 2:
       view.setText(""some text"");
       view.setPadding(5, 5, 5, 5);
       view.setLayoutParams(new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));
       break;
}
layout.addView(view);
return layout;

<ul>
<li>I have a UIViewController subclass which does something in its viewWillAppear and viewDidAppear methods.</li>
<li>I want to nest this view controller in a UINavigationViewController.</li>
<li>Depending on the view hierarchy complexity the two methods <code>viewWillAppear</code> and <code>viewDidAppear</code> of my controller may not be called.</li>
</ul>

<p>What should I do then to make sure these two methods are always called regardless of my view hierarchy?</p>

<p>Example of a ""complex"" view hierarchy: </p>

<pre><code>UIViewController subclass containing a UITabBarController
     |_ Each tab containing a UINavigationViewController
         |_ Each UINavigationController controller containing a custom UIViewController
</code></pre>

<p>When you present the TabBarController as a modal view the <code>viewWillAppear</code> and <code>viewDidAppear</code> methods of the TabBarController are called but not those of the custom UIViewControllers nested under the UINavigationViewControllers.</p>

Users can either like or post a comment about a business but the same <strong>can not</strong> happen with a person. When a user posts something about a business or likes it, that business is called the <code>target</code> of that like or post:</p>

<pre><code>trait TargetingRelation[TargetingType[_],TargetedType]

class Business

class Person

class Post[Target | TargetingRelation[Business,Post] ] {
  def target:Target
}

class Like[Target | TargetingRelation[Business,Like] ] {
  def target:Target
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here I'm inventing a <code>T | P[T]</code> notation meaning type parameter <code>T</code> such that it satisfies some property <code>P[T]</code> (or <code>T :|: P[T]</code> if it carries more type-appeal). Somewhere else in the code I want to have declarations like:</p>

<pre><code>object canPostAboutBusiness extends TargetingRelation[Post,Business] 
object canLikeBusiness      extends TargetingRelation[Like,Business]
</code></pre>

<p>these objects are evidences actually, something like Haskell type-classes. So this would type check:</p>

<pre><code>val p = new Post[Business]
val l = new Like[Business]
</code></pre>

<p>but <strong>not</strong> this one:</p>

<pre><code>val p = new Post[Person]
val l = new Like[Person]
</code></pre>

<p>As far as my knowledge of Scala permits, I can't model this particular state of affairs in a satisfactory way. Now I insist that this is <strong>not</strong> sub-typing because Business is <strong>not</strong> a:</p>

<pre><code>class Business extends 
  TargetingRelation[Post,Business] with 
  TargetingRelation[Like,Business]
</code></pre>

<p>As a matter of fact it is very desirable that <code>Business</code> remains totally ignorant of the <code>Post</code>. The relationship is actually outside of both <code>Post</code> and <code>Business</code>. Besides, I suppose the above code would not even compile to begin with since <code>Business</code> is inheriting from <code>TargetingRelation</code> twice. Insights are most welcome.</p>

<p>This is nice because all methods which use a stored procedure to retrieve data can just pass the resultset to the loadDataToEntity method and get back an entity.</p>

<p>So it's a good way to reduce code but I often hear that you should retrieve as few columns as possible. To use my general method all stored procedures needs to fetch all columns needed for loadDataToEntity(). Also, when a column is added to the table and is retrieved by a stored procedure all other stored procedures needs to be altered and also retrieve that column.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there's a better way to both achieve a general method and also retrieve different number of columns sometimes depending on the stored procedure?</p>

<pre><code> 
public Entity getById(int id)  
{    
    ResultSet rs;

}
public Entity loadDataToEntity(ResultSet rs)
{
    // fill and return entity here

When I run the server code with <code>node server.js</code> everything works OK, but when running the node webkit application that uses the same server code I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>""Uncaught Error: dlopen(/Users/me/myfolder/node_modules/mdns/build/Release/dns_sd_bindings.node, 1): no suitable image found.  Did find:

</code></pre>

<p>Apparently when you install the <code>mdns</code> module with <code>npm</code> it's built for an x86 architecture and I need it for i386, because node-webkit is built for i386 (I found out about this by reading this thread: <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=879780"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=879780</a>). You can verify it by running this in a terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ lipo -info /Applications/node-webkit.app/Contents/MacOS/node-webkit 
Non-fat file: /Applications/node-webkit.app/Contents/MacOS/node-webkit is architecture: i386
</code></pre>

<p>I found this link suggesting a solution: <a href=""https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/issues/296"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/issues/296</a> for another module (node proxy). The suggested instructions are:</p>

<pre><code>I managed to build a 32-bit version of node-proxy as follows:
I installed nw-gyp 
I ran nw-gyp configure --target=0.3.6  
I edited the generated file nodeproxy.target.mk in the build directory by replacing -arch x86_64by -arch i386 
I ran nw-gyp build
</code></pre>

<p>But as I'm not used to building node modules manually, while following the instructions it wasn't clear to me in which folder I should run those steps (I assumed it's in the module folder inside <code>node_modules</code>:
a) when I install nw-gyp I don't get the nw-gyp command to use globally (I guess the -g option is missing in the instructions)
b) using instead <code>gyp configure --target=0.3.6</code> gives me an error saying that there is no option <code>target</code>
c) I tried skipping the configure step (just to try) and the build command breaks with: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could not automatically locate src directory.  This isa temporary
  Chromium feature that will be removed.  Use--depth as a workaround.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But when trying to use --depth (of course) it requires an argument, I couldn't find out what to put there.</p>

<p>So... how should I build the mdns module for using it with node webkit? (either the 0.8.6 version or the 0.10.0, I can adapt).</p>

<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2154622/why-does-jpa-have-a-transient-annotation"">Why does JPA have a @Transient annotation?</a></p>

<p>I have a transient variable that I do not want to persist and it is marked with the transient annotation.
However, when I want to produce JSON from my rest controller, this transient variable is not available in the outputted JSON.</p>

<p>The POJO PublicationVO is straight forward with no fancy attributes, just some private attributes (that are persisted) with getters and setters and 1 transient variable.</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value = { ""{publicationId}""}, method = RequestMethod.GET, produces = ""application/json"")
@ResponseBody public PublicationVO getPublicationDetailsJSON(@PathVariable(value = ""publicationId"") Integer publicationId) {
    LOG.info(""Entered getPublicationDetailsJSON - publicationId: "" + publicationId);

    //Call method to get the publicationVO based on publicationId
    PublicationVO publicationVO = publicationServices.getPublicationByIdForRestCalls(publicationId);       
    LOG.info(""publicationVO:{}"", publicationVO);

    LOG.info(""Exiting getPublicationDetailsJSON"");
    return publicationVO;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The PublicationVO is as follows</p>

<pre><code>    package com.trinity.domain.dao;

<p>When I see the debug statement for publicationVO in my logs, the transient variable is included in the output but in my client code, the transient variable is not included in the json response.</p>

<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

I haven't found any documentation on how the various panels interoperate or if they are even aware of each other.

<p>So far I've come up with the following solution:</p>

        SelectObject(hdc_memory, hbitmap);
        // paint onto the bitmap
        BitBlt(hdc_memory, bounds.x, bounds.y, bounds.width, bounds.height, hdc_screen, bounds.x, bounds.y, SRCPAINT);
        // release the screen DC
        ReleaseDC(NULL, hdc_screen);

            for(size_t j = bounds.y; j &lt; bounds.y + bounds.height; ++j)
            {

</code></pre>

<p>*Note: Rectangle is actually a struct I created with 4 <code>size_t</code> fields for the top-left x &amp; y coordinate, and the width and height of the rectangle. It is not the WinAPI Rectangle.</p>

<p>I had a few questions about this code:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I properly releasing all resources?</li>
<li>Is there a better way to do this? I'm looking for something with a similar level of complexity and flexibility a 2d array of RGB values would have. The final screen capture data processing will be done with OpenCL so I would prefer to not have any complicated structure.</li>

<p>So in other words this should authenticate user to a specific box.com account without asking the user to enter any account credentials.</p>

<li>they only support OAuth 2, and</li>

be possible with OAuth 2, but</li>
<li>that their help desk formally only supports login processes that

<p>I first tried to call ""ls"" but my problem is that I don't know when the output from the command is finished, so that I know I can send another command, and check the output from the first command.</p>

<p>I would expect sftp to print out its prompt again when the command is done, like so:</p>

<pre><code>sftp&gt;ls
...output...
sftp&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That way I would know when the command is finished. However what happens is that I just get ...output... but I never receive the new sftp> prompt.</p>

<p>I don't understand how come this works in command-line and not when manually ran through pipes. Also <a href=""http://www.toppa.com/2005/using-phps-program-execution-functions-for-sftp/"" rel=""nofollow"">this PHP article</a> suggests this approach of waiting for the sftp> prompt.</p>

<p>I have coded two implementations, in java and ruby, and both show the same behaviour. I'm careful of not using a buffered reader, because I'm aware that could cause a problem since sftp does not place a carriage return after the ""sftp>"" prompt, but to no avail.</p>

<p>If I run in the shell <code>echo ls | sftp &lt;parameters&gt;</code> then it outputs and exits, without giving a new prompt. That would actually be a ""good enough"" behaviour for me.</p>

<p>I am aware I can write all the commands I want to run in a file and give that file to sftp through a command argument, but I find the pipe approach more workable and less clunky than resorting to a temporary file.</p>

<p>Here is the Java implementation:</p>

<pre><code>String[] cmd = new String[]{""sftp"", Config.getSshTargetUsername()
      + ""@"" + Config.getSshTargetHost()};

Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);
InputStreamReader inp = new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream());
OutputStreamWriter out = new OutputStreamWriter(p.getOutputStream());

out.write(""ls\n"");
out.flush();

StringBuilder read = new StringBuilder();
char[] buf = new char[256];
while (true) {
    int bytes = inp.read(buf);
    read.append(buf, 0, bytes);
    System.out.println(read);
    System.out.flush();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the ruby one:</p>

<pre><code>require 'open3'
cmd = ""sftp #{username}@#{host}""
Open3.popen2e(cmd) do |stdin, stdout_err, wait_thr|
  stdin.puts ""ls""
  while chr = stdout_err.getc
    putc chr
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: now I realised if I launch bash for instance I get the exact same behaviour. So it's a general thing about pipes, not specifically tied to sftp.</p>

"23230998","1","","","2014-04-22 21:59:22","","1","1461","<p>I'm deploying a node web application as an upstart service using grunt and monitoring it using monit. However:</p>

<ol>
<li>My upstart and monit configuration duplicate each other a little bit</li>
<li>Upstart doesn't do variable expansion inside env stanzas</li>
<li>I can't find a way to configure monit dynamically (ala upstart <code>.override</code> files)</li>
</ol>

<h2>My question</h2>

<p>This means I'm looking for a grunt plugin or other tool that I can use to generate the uptstart .conf and monit conf.d/ files. Can you please help me find one (or suggest a better way of robustly running my node web app)?</p>

<h2>A rather crude solution?</h2>

<p>To be honest an underscore template of the upstart and monit files would probably be sufficient, and that's what I'll wrap up into a grunt plugin if there isn't a ready-made solution, but this feels like a problem that other people must have run into as well so I imagine there's a solution out there, I just can't find it.</p>

<h2>Detail</h2>

<p>A bit more detail to illustrate the three problems. My upstart conf file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>setuid node
setgid node

# ...

script
    mkdir -p /home/node/.my-app
    echo $$ &gt; /home/node/.my-app/upstart.pid
    /usr/local/bin/node /var/node/my-app/server.js &gt;&gt; /var/node/my-app/logs/console.log 2&gt;&amp;1
end script

# ...
</code></pre>

<p>And my monit configuration looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>check process node with pidfile /home/node/.my-app/upstart.pid
    start program = ""/sbin/start my-app"" with timeout 60 seconds
    stop program  = ""/sbin/stop my-app""
    if failed host localhost port 17394 protocol http 
        and request ""/monit.html""
        then restart
    if 3 restarts within 5 cycles then timeout
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the PID file path and config directory is duplicated across the two (problem 1) and I'd love to parameterise the host, port and request URL in the monit file (problem 3).</p>

<p>For problem 2 (no variable expansion in upstart's <code>env</code> stanza, bug report <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/upstart/+bug/328366"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>) there are a couple of workarounds that work for variables used inside *script blocks, which are interpreted as bash scripts, but they don't seem to work in the conf file itself. I think this makes it impossible to specify the user id the app should run as in a configuration file?</p>

<p>Those techniques I just mentioned:</p>

I have been using this to host the CLR using C++/CLI compiler-generated hosting code, allowing me to call C# code from the game. This has been working great and it is a very elegant solution.</p>

<p>Once the CLR is loaded by the game, it searches game.exe.config in the game executable folder, for further .NET assembly probing information:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;runtime&gt;
    &lt;assemblyBinding xmlns=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1""&gt;

&lt;startup&gt;&lt;supportedRuntime version=""v4.0"" sku="".NETFramework,Version=v4.0,Profile=Client""/&gt;&lt;/startup&gt;&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This arbitrary config file breaks my folder structure; I would like my project to be self-contained in the <code>@Arma2NET</code> folder and not have random config files in the game folder. At the moment, having the project files in the same folder as the native CLR-hosting DLL is impossible because of the game's folder requirements.</p>

<p>Is there a way to programmatically provide the CLR with this config from native code when it is starting, short of writing the entirety of the CLR-hosting code myself?</p>

<p>In order to manage all kind of communication, I use an Object ""Packet"" which stores all information that I want to send. (Sender, receivers, file ...).</p>

<p>Here is a code sample where I write in the stream :</p>

<pre><code>private void write(Packet packet) throws IOException {
    ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    ObjectOutputStream os = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);
    os.writeObject(packet);
    this.outStream.write(bos.toByteArray());
}
</code></pre>

<p>And outStream is an OutputStream.</p>

<p>Here is my Connection run :</p>

<pre><code>public void run() {
    while (isRunning()) {
        try {
            byte[] buffer = new byte[65536];
            // Read from the InputStream
            inStream.read(buffer);
            ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(buffer));
            Packet p = (Packet) in.readObject();

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            this.disconnect();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It works very well for all purpose except files transfer !
I put the file in a byte[] (with filestream) and store the array in my Packet Object.
When the server receive the communication it breaks on the ""in.readObject()"" and give me a pretty ""java io streamcorruptedexception wrong format : 0"" exception.</p>

<p>I tried the transfer with a custom byte[] (filled by a string.getBytes()) and it worked very well.</p>

<p>So, what am I doing wrong ?</p>

<p>So far, the best way I could think to do it was to have a single drop down where the user would select the subscription type and then two forms side-by-side (one where they would enter in the CC info and another with just a big PayPal button).  I arrived at this decision so that in the one form, I could send a <code>?paymentType=CreditCard</code> querystring parameter and in the other, I could send <code>?paymentType=Paypal</code>.  This gets me out of having to check if buttonText == ""Next"" process as CC, else redirect to PayPal.</p>

<p>However, seeing as the subscription control is not part of <em>either</em> form, I can't access the type that has been selected without duplicating the control in both forms (which doesn't provide the best user experience).</p>

<p>I guess it has something to do with the other jquery files that are loaded but I'm not sure how to solve it. This is the generated HTML:</p>

<p>For this example, I use jquery to bind a function, ""showAddToDb()"", to a button. When that button is pressed, jquery should append the following html form code into the div labeled by the id ""memberContent"" (which I have left out here). </p>

<pre><code> $(document).ready(function() {
        $('#addToDb').bind('click',showAddToDb);
 });
 function showAddToDb() {
        var form = $(""&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"");
        var formName = ""&lt;div class=\""formRow\""&gt;&lt;label for=\""name\""&gt;Name: &lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class=\""nameInput\"" type=\""text\"" name=\""name\""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"";
        var formLocation = ""&lt;div class=\""formRow\""&gt;&lt;label for=\""location\""&gt;Location: &lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class=\""locationInput\"" type=\""text\"" name=\""location\""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"";
        var formDes = ""&lt;div class=\""formRow\""&gt;&lt;label for=\""description\""&gt;Description: &lt;/label&gt;&lt;textarea class=\""descriptionInput\"" name=\""description\"" rows=\""10\"" maxlength=\""1000\""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"";
        var formPrice = ""&lt;div class=\""formRow\""&gt;&lt;label for=\""price\""&gt;Price: &lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class=\""priceInput\"" type=\""text\"" name=\""price\""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"";
        var formSubmit = ""&lt;div class=\""formRow\""&gt;&lt;button onclick=\""addToDb()\""&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"";
        form.append(formName);
        form.append(formLocation);
        form.append(formDes);
        form.append(formPrice);
        form.append(formSubmit);
        $('#memberContent').append(form);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The code above works, but I struggled to get it working and my question is why it works. To get it to work, I had to change the first line of the function from <code>var form = ""&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"";</code> to <code>var form = $(""&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"");</code></p>

<p>I know that the dollar sign stands for a jquery call, but I'm not sure why I need that here in this particular case. Also, am I supposed to also wrap all the other vars with <code>$()</code> for appending? It works as is, but I have seen some examples online that do this without explaining why.</p>

<p>A part the code structure that is very complex and was not made by me, the final result should be related to a div that shows an enlarged image and information of a clicked thumbnail.
As you can see, the function tries to hide an eventual already open div, and AFTER it should change its content with the new clicked thumbnail.</p>

<p>In my opinion, placing these 3 rows INSIDE callback function of hide() should change the content only after hiding sequence is complete, but is not so. During runtime, a click will start hiding sequence but conten change starts just immediately, not after hiding is complete...</p>

<p>Can you tell me why?
Thank you</p>

<p>I have a REST API implemented in Java using Jersey. My API uses four verbs: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. 
I find developing REST APIs in java very easy and straight forward.</p>

<p>eg here is an elaborate <code>hello</code> webservice (I say elaborate because there are easier ways, but this is more representative):</p>

<pre><code>import javax.ws.rs.*;

@Path(""/myresource"")
public class MyResource{

   @GET
   @Path(""name/{name}"")
   @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, MediaType.APPLICATION_XML})
   public Response sayHello(@PathParam(""name"") String name){
       return Response.ok(""Hello ""+name).build();
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>PROBLEM:</p>

<p>I am learning python. I want to convert my Java Jersey REST API into python.</p>

<p>Basically Jersey is Java's implementation of REST (aka JAX-RS: Java API for RESTful Web Services). Does python have a reference implementation of REST? If not, is there any implementation out there that comes close and would be easy to use for someone coming from Java-Jersey?</p>

<p>I also have an ID in my table, but as I've been researching this issue without managing to fix it, I also read that I don't need to specify the ID in the script as the user is getting an ID automatically, but as I haven't gotten this to work I wouldn't know for sure. </p>

<p>I'm very new to php and databases in general, but I've been stuck on this for a while now, so any help would be greatly appreciated :)</p>

I've had trouble registering mixed-mode DLL's using the built-in registration property (""vsdraCOM"" enumerated value of the ""Register"" property.)  As a workaround, I've added a .NET custom install assembly (with a class that derives from System.Configuration.Install.Installer.)  I'm certain that that class is running and a number of operations successfully install and uninstall through code in that assembly, including executing the Dll(Un)RegisterServer entry point of a number of assemblies.  </p>

<p>However, one DLL is not successfully registering.  It is the only DLL that depends on some 3rd-party redistributable assemblies that want to be installed to the GAC.  I have those assemblies installed to the GAC thanks to the built-in support for that in VS 2008's setup and deployment projects, and I know that is working.  I've confirmed that what is happening is that the custom action is executing before the installer executes the GAC installation.  </p>

<p>Whew.  So my question is, is there a way to force the installer to execute the GAC installation before executing the custom action?  Is there a way to use the ""Condition"" property of the custom action to do this?  If not, what's my best alternative?  Capturing the registry entries from the DLL and adding them to the registry settings for the installer (don't like this because someone may add new COM servers to the class in the future)?  Using .NET code to install the assembly into the GAC manually (don't know how to do that yet)?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>On Windows my renderer-class has a _renderProject (e.g. a game I’m making) and a _view object that again has a GLFW window. I do my loop in the renderer as follows:</p>

<pre><code>void Renderer::runRenderer()
{
   while (_running &amp;&amp; _view-&gt;isRunning())
   {
       draw((_view-&gt;getTime() - _initialTime));
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The draw function looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>void Renderer::draw(double currentTime)
{
    [...]
    // Call loop function of the project
    if (_renderProject)
        _renderProject-&gt;loopFunction(currentTime - _elapsedTime, currentTime);
    [...]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to do the same thing for iOS but I don’t know how to do the loop in the renderer class. 
I would like to use CADisplayLink but I don't know how to call a C++ memeber function from there.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Following the code written by @Kazuki Sakamoto I changed my code to this:</p>

@interface RendererCaller : NSObject
{
    CADisplayLink *_displayLink;
}
@property (nonatomic, copy) block_t updateBlock;
@end

@implementation RendererCaller

- (void)start:(block_t)block
{
    self.updateBlock = block;
    // check whether the loop is already running
    if(_displayLink == nil)
    {
        // specify update method
        _displayLink = [CADisplayLink displayLinkWithTarget:self selector:@selector(update:)];

        // add the display link to the run loop (will be called 60 times per second)
        [_displayLink addToRunLoop:[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] forMode:NSDefaultRunLoopMode];
    }
}

- (void)stop
{
    // check whether the loop is already stopped
    if (_displayLink != nil) {
        // if the display link is present, it gets invalidated (loop stops)
        [_displayLink invalidate];
        _displayLink = nil;
    }
}

- (void)update:(CADisplayLink *)sender
{
    double time = [sender timestamp];
    updateBlock(time);   /// ERROR, it doesn't know ""updateBlock""
}

@end

/* Renderer */

void Renderer::runRenderer()
{
    if (_rendererCaller == nil) _rendererCaller = [[RendererCaller alloc] init]; 
    [_rendererCaller start:^(double time) {
            this-&gt;draw(time);
        }];
}

void Renderer::stopRenderer()
{
    [_rendererCaller stop];
}

void Renderer::terminateRenderer()
{

{ 
    [...]

    [...]
}

<p>This is what the <code>endElement()</code> method looks like:</p>

<p>Since <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is part of <code>&lt;desc&gt;</code> tag, the code in last <code>else if</code> condition never gets executed.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When I read the the <code>&lt;desc&gt;</code> tag, I could do a manual <code>String</code> search to retrieve the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag content. But, I am sure there has to be a more efficient way.</p>

<p>Can someone guide me on to get content of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Updated the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. It is now closed correctly. </p>

<p>2- Authenticate the same user Foo using FBA and a custom membership provider. </p>

In this case the image is about 50% of the screen width. So I want to center it. Unfortunately the only way I found to center it is, to use <code>layout_gravity=""center""</code> on the <code>LinearLayout</code>.</p>

<p>Here's my xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;HorizontalScrollView
            android:layout_gravity=""center""
            android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
            android:layout_height=""wrap_content""&gt;

        &lt;LinearLayout
                android:orientation=""horizontal""
                android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
                android:layout_height=""wrap_content""&gt;

        &lt;ImageView                    
                android:src=""@drawable/myImg""
                android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
                android:adjustViewBounds=""true""
                android:layout_height=""150dp""/&gt;

        &lt;/LinearLayout&gt;

    &lt;/HorizontalScrollView&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But I need to set the <code>layout_gravity</code> programmatically. Does anybody has an idea how I can achieve this or knows a different way? All the things I found via Google are not working for me like <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/8049620/1331671"">this post</a>.</p>

<p>I have updated my SDK for the latest APIs and noticed that the ClipboardManager features I was using are deprecated. I updated the code to use the newer ClipData model and tried it out on my Froyo phone and, of course, I get a NoClassDefFoundError in the new code.</p>

<p>I've had a look around SO and haven't found any real discussions of general strategy for maintaining backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure how I should handle this and other situations where the API differs, because I want users of all versions to be able to use my app.</p>

<p>Should I be doing a check as follows?</p>

<pre><code>if(version == old){
   use old API;
} else {
   use new API;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If so, I have deprecated code in my class and Eclipse will have the warning there forever.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I could just build against an old version of the API and hope that new versions will handle it okay. But then I run the risk of building against buggy or low-performance code when a better alternative is available.</p>

<p>What is the best way to deal with this?</p>

<p>My question is whether const call-by-reference is also faster if using primitive types, like bool, int or double.</p>

        public string DealId { get; set; }
        public string StreetAddress { get; set; }

        public string ZipCode { get; set; }
        public string Logo { get; set; }
        public string Website { get; set; }

        public string TotalRows { get; set; }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>And the controller:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Index()
        {
            LinqToDealsDataContext db = new LinqToDealsDataContext();
            XElement xmlTree = XElement.Parse(""&lt;Request&gt;&lt;ZipCode&gt;92612&lt;/ZipCode&gt;&lt;/Request&gt;"");

            var deals = db.spSearchDeals(xmlTree);

            return View(deals);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>And with this configuration I'm now getting this error:</p>

<pre><code>The model item passed into the dictionary is of type 'System.Data.Linq.SqlClient.SqlProvider+SingleResult`1[Data.Models.spSearchDealsResult]', but this dictionary requires a model item of type 'Data.Models.GetDealsModel'.
</code></pre>

<p>I'm guessing that there's an issue connecting my Controller to my Model... I'm not sure why. PLEASE help me connect this final peice.</p>

<p>NOTE: I do understand that eventually I should separate my logic in the controller into a Repository Pattern, but for now, this will do.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, hard coding a method name or a regular expression that resembles a method name should be the last thing we ever put ourselves through. We've all learned it the hard way from the XML hell in early 2000s.</p>

<p>In contrast, EJB3's interceptors is annotation based, simple, easier to read and it's more than capable of tackling most if not all of our problems. Wouldn't it be nice if we can code an EJB3 style interceptor in Spring?</p>

<p>The best solution I know of is to use <code>@annotation</code> in the pointcut expression, as I've done in the following codes:</p>

<pre><code>@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface AroundExecution {

}

@Component
public class SimpleBean {
    @AroundExecution
    public void printGreetings(){
        logger.info(""Hello World 2"");
    }
}

@Aspect
@Component
public class SimpleAdvice {
    @Around(""@annotation(com.myinterceptors.springaop.AroundExecution)"")
    public Object adviceAround(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
        Object retVal = null;
        try {
            logger.info(""Before executing"");
            retVal = joinPoint.proceed();
            logger.info(""After executing"");
        } 
        catch(Throwable e) {
            logger.error(""Execution error"");
            throw e;
        }
        return retVal;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems it's impossible to eliminate that last bit of hard-coding of the annotation class name. </p>

<p>If I was using Guice, I could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>    public class SimpleModule extends AbstractModule {
        protected void configure() {
        AroundInterceptor interceptor = new AroundInterceptor();
        bindInterceptor(
            Matchers.any(), 
            Matchers.annotatedWith(BeforeExecution.class).or(Matchers.annotatedWith(AfterExecution.class)), 
            interceptor
        );
        }
    }

public class AroundInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AroundInterceptor.class);

    public Object invoke(MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable {

        try{
            if(invocation.getMethod().getAnnotation(BeforeExecution.class)!=null){
                invokeBefore(invocation);
            }
            return invocation.proceed();
        }
        finally{
            if(invocation.getMethod().getAnnotation(AfterExecution.class)!=null){
                invokeAfter(invocation);
            }
        }
    }

    protected void invokeBefore(MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable {
        logger.info(""Intercepted before executing: ""+invocation.getMethod().getName());
    }


    protected void invokeAfter(MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable {
        logger.info(""Intercepted after executing: ""+invocation.getThis().getClass().getName()+"".""+
                invocation.getMethod().getName());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Not exactly the prettiest, but it gets the job done.</p>

<p>Decorators pattern is an alternative, but it adds a lot of overhead in maintenance:</p>

<p><a href=""http://niklasschlimm.blogspot.com.au/2011/08/jsr-299-cdi-decorators-for-spring-beans.html"" rel=""nofollow"">JSR-299 CDI Decorators for Spring beans</a></p>

<p>It'd be much easier if Spring can allow augmentation to the pointcut expression to support class definition as parameters e.g. <code>@Around(""@annotatedWith"", MyAnnotation.class)</code></p>

<p>I wonder if anyone has ever implemented interceptors in Spring that doesn't require hard coding in metadata or application context?</p>

<p>Why? Shouldn't the second query be much much faster, as there's no condition, no second query. All the database needs to do is select last 15 records, compare to the first one where it needs to SCAN every single record AFTER performing a sub query and check if the ids are contained in it. I am just really confused a query that should performnce much faster is actually perofming 5x slower. </p>

I cannot use a clearscreen for the NetBeans IDE. I've tried the runtime things, but those are for the actual command line, and I've even tried the weird combination of unicode things like:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.print(""\033[H\033[2J"");
System.out.flush();
</code></pre>

<p>That doesn't work either. (Don't even know what flush does)</p>

<p>EDIT: I also do not want the shortcut like Ctrl+H or whatever to manually clear it, there's gotta be a line of code that does that for me.. </p>

<p>I was just wondering if there was some way of making the IDE console to clear itself so lets say, I call a different method that prints out 15 lines of text into the IDE console, after you leave said method, all of that goes blank AND the text starts back @ the top instead of the bottom, like some I know would suggest using the \n\n\n\n to make an artificial clear. That's not what I'm after.</p>

<p>If anyone knows how to do this, I would be very appreciative if you could share this trick :)</p>

<p>For those of you who may not know which console I'm talking about, this printscreen is it: <a href=""http://prntscr.com/6ov74z"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prntscr.com/6ov74z</a></p>

<p>State Monad definition:</p>

<pre><code>case class State[S, A](runState: S =&gt; (S, A)) {

  def flatMap[B](f: A =&gt; State[S, B]): State[S, B] = {
    State(s =&gt; {
      val (s1, a) = runState(s)
      val (s2, b) = f(a).runState(s1)
      (s2, b)
    })
  }

  def map[B](f: A =&gt; B): State[S, B] = {
    flatMap(a =&gt; {
      State(s =&gt; (s, f(a)))
    })
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Two different State types:</p>

<pre><code>type AppendBang[A] = State[Int, A]

type AddOne[A] = State[String, A]
</code></pre>

<p>Two methods with differnt State return types:</p>

<pre><code>def addOne(n: Int): AddOne[Int] = State(s =&gt; (s + ""."", n + 1))

def appendBang(str: String): AppendBang[String] = State(s =&gt; (s + 1, str + "" !!!""))
</code></pre>

<p>Define a function to use the two functions above:</p>

<pre><code>def myAction(n: Int) = for {
  a &lt;- addOne(n)
  b &lt;- appendBang(a.toString)
} yield (a, b)
</code></pre>

<p>And I hope to use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>println(myAction(1))
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is <code>myAction</code> is not compilable, it reports some error like this:</p>

<pre><code>Error:(14, 7) type mismatch;
 found   : state_monad.State[Int,(Int, String)]
 required: state_monad.State[String,?]
    b &lt;- appendBang(a.toString)
      ^
</code></pre>

<p>How can I fix it? Do I have to define some Monad transformers?</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: The question may be not clear, let me give an example</p>

<p>Say I want to define another function, which uses <code>addOne</code> and <code>appendBang</code> internally. Since they all need existing states, I have to pass some to it:</p>

<pre><code>def myAction(n: Int)(addOneState: String, appendBangState: Int): ((String, Int), String) = {
  val (addOneState2, n2) = addOne(n).runState(addOneState)
  val (appendBangState2, n3) = appendBang(n2.toString).runState(appendBangState)
  ((addOneState2, appendBangState2), n3)
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have to run <code>addOne</code> and <code>appendBang</code> one by one, passing and getting the states and result manually.</p>

<p>Although I found it can return another <code>State</code>, the code is not improved much:</p>

<pre><code>def myAction(n: Int): State[(String, Int), String] = State {  
case (addOneState: String, appendBangState: Int) =&gt;  
  val (addOneState2, n2) = addOne(n).runState(addOneState)  
  val (appendBangState2, n3) = appendBang(n2.toString).runState(  appendBangState)
    ((addOneState2, appendBangState2), n3)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since I'm not quite familiar with them, just wondering is there any way to improve it. The best hope is that I can use <code>for</code> comprehension, but not sure if that's possible</p>

<p>1º I have created a project that use OpenCV2.framework + foo using Cmake, create a XCode project using foo.a . My executable link OpenCV2.framework + foo.a and work perfectly, compile and link.</p>

<p>2º I have used Ogre´s template to create another project. This project work perfectly.</p>

<p>3º Then, I try to add foo.a to the new project, to make the same things that my executable used in step 1.</p>

<li>Using otool -hv foo.a --> I see the cputype is ARV V7 to all lib.o</li>
<li>Using lipo -info foo.a --> I see foo.a is armv7 or armv7s when i use that arch.</li>
<li>Using nm foo.a | grep functionname --> I see the function is inside the library in armv7 and armv7s when compile both arch.</li>

<p>So, if the library work in another project, and the functions are inside, why the linking problem?</p>

<p>Now that last line there means that !errorlevel! == 0 (ie, ""TTL"" was indeed found)
so up to this point it looks like the script is working. However on the next loop, 10.167.194.23 (alive) got skipped as well as .30 and .46 . I decided to add </p>

<pre><code>echo %errorlevel% 
</code></pre>

<p>at the end of the loop to see whats going on here.  Apparently, after every ping %errorlevel% was 0 so clearly </p>

<pre><code>ping -n %ipAddress%.%%i | find ""TTL"" &gt;nul
</code></pre>

<p>is where my issue is. According to this statement, ""TTL"" is being found after every ping, which is false, between 10.167.194.22-.50 only 3 machines are alive.</p>

<p>by the way, when i do</p>

<pre><code>!errorlevel! == 0
</code></pre>

<p>what does that mean? </p>

<p><strong>Everything below this line is as of 4/26/12</strong></p>

<pre><code>So my new script looks like this 

@echo on


set /p ipAddress=""enter ip address: ""

find ""TTL"" test.txt
if %errorlevel% == 0 (
deploy_this.bat %ipaddress%.%%i
)
</code></pre>

<p>i first tried the script without the if errorlevel check,
and it worked fine. It started pinging the ip address that i provided and proceeded to .2 .3 .4 .5 and so on.</p>

<p>once i added this however...</p>

<pre><code>if %errorlevel% == 0 (

<p>this is what happens</p>

"32580033","1","","","2015-09-15 07:21:17","","10","638","<p>A(nother?) question about how variable scope is applied in relation to closures. Here's a minimal example:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo
{
    public string name;
    public Foo(string name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }
}


public class Program
{
    static Action getAction(Foo obj)
    {
        return () =&gt; Console.WriteLine(obj.name); 
    }

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Foo obj1 = new Foo(""x1"");    
        Action a = getAction(obj1);  
        obj1 = new Foo(""x2"");        
        a();                         
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This prints <code>x1</code>. It can be explained as:</p>

<p><strong><code>getAction</code> returns an anonymous function which has a closure enclosing the variable <code>obj</code>. <code>obj</code> has the same reference <em>value</em> as <code>obj1</code> but its relationship with <code>obj1</code> ends there as the closure encloses only <code>obj</code>. In other words, whatever value <code>obj1</code> takes afterwards does not affect the closure. Therefore whenever/however <code>a</code> gets called (eg. <code>a</code> gets passed to some other function) it will always print <code>x1</code>.</strong></p>

<p>Now my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the above explanation correct?</li>
<li>I don't have a specific scenario in mind but what if we wanted the program to print <code>x2</code> (eg. closure to enclose an outer scope)? Could it be done (or doesn't it make sense to even attempt)?</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a function <code>makeNewDataTable()</code> which creates a <code>DataTable</code> instance and adds a set of columns to it; this part is working fine.</p>

<p>When I manually iterate over the list, the correct number of rows (with correct data) are added to the DataTable:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>DataTable dataTable = makeNewDataTable();
if (inputList != null)
{
    //inputList.Select(item =&gt; dataTable.Rows.Add(item.Property, DBNull.Value));
    foreach (var item in inputList)
    {
        dataTable.Rows.Add(item.Property, DBNull.Value);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I try to use a lambda expression to the same end:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>DataTable dataTable = makeNewDataTable();
if (inputList != null)
{
    inputList.Select(item =&gt; dataTable.Rows.Add(item.Property, DBNull.Value));
    //foreach (var item in inputList)
    //{
    //    dataTable.Rows.Add(item.Property, DBNull.Value);
    //}
}
</code></pre>

<p>then after the <code>if</code> statement's closing <code>}</code> I see that <code>dataTable.Rows.Count == 0</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Why don't I see the rows as having been added when I use the lambda expression, when the manually coded foreach loop works fine?</strong></p>

<p><em>Bonus question:</em> Is there a way to do what I want using the more concise syntax of lambda expressions rather than manually coding a foreach loop?</p>

<ol>
<li>It is composed entirely of maps, arrays, and primitives.</li>
<li>It is hierarchical. Maps contain name/value pairs, where a value can
be another map, an array, or a primitive. Arrays contain values with the same rules.</li>
<li>The top level is always a map.</li>
<li>The primitives are strings, integers, floats, booleans, and possibly
dates.</li>
<li>Sometimes the map is just an unordered hash, and sometimes the order
of the name/value pairs matter.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a really, really useful structure. You can use it to represent documents, database records, various messages, http requests, lots of stuff. I've run into it in Freemarker (as the 'data model'), Mongo, and anything that uses JSON.</p>

<p>It's not really JSON, because that's a file format, not a specification for a particular data structure. It's not an ""object"", because object trees can point to other things, like streams and functions. It's not a DOM.</p>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p>Around the office, we've started to call it a ""garg"", for ""generalized argument"".</p>

<p>This has been working with no issues until this evening. I updated VS 2013 express to community, updated bootstrap to the latest version (shows 3.3.0 on my VS 2013) and that's it. I diff'd my  .cshtml file and there's no changes there.</p>

<p>Now when I click the login button, the modal pops up but greys out the whole page, and I cannot edit the input fields in the form. And when I click anywhere on the modal is just closes.</p>

<p>No idea where to even begin to debug this... anyone have any ideas? </p>

<p>(the jquery version is 2.1.1, bootstrap 3.3.0)</p>

<p>thank you for your help</p>

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<p>Seems it's something to do when I moved from bootstrap 3.2.0 to 3.3.0. I reverted the bootstrap.js and bootstrap.min.js back to 3.2.0 and the modal works again. I'm going to leave this question as is - perhaps there's a fix on the way that I can download via nuget on vs 2013 and this goes away.</p>

To resolve this I first made the <code>_pickle_method</code> and <code>_unpickle_method</code> as described <a href=""http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/552476-why-cant-you-pickle-instancemethods"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.  Then I realized that I was (originally) trying to pass <code>pool.map()</code> a list of sockets (very not picklable) so I changed it to the list of hostnames, as strings can be pickled.  I still get this error, however.</p>

<p>I then tried calling <code>pickle.dumps()</code> directly on <code>self.method</code>, <code>self.servers.keys()</code>, and <code>self.servers.keys()[0]</code>.  As expected it worked fine for the latter two, but from the first I get</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: a class that defines __slots__ without defining __getstate__ cannot be pickled.
</code></pre>

<p>Some more research lead me to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2204155/why-am-i-getting-an-error-about-my-class-defining-slots-when-trying-to-pickl"">this question</a>, which seems to indicate that the issue is with the use of sockets (and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/2204177/3076272"">gnibbler's answer</a> to that question would seem to confirm it).</p>

<p>Is there a way that I can actually use multiprocessing for this?  From what I've (very briefly) read <a href=""https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos"" rel=""nofollow""><code>pathos.multiprocessing</code></a> might be what I need, but I'd really like to stick to the standard library if at all possible.</p>

<p>I'm also not set on using multiprocessing - if multithreading would work better and avoid this issue then I'm more than open to those solutions.</p>

I want to handle this submission within one same page, but for the new added 2 datas (name &amp; room number) I don't want to do one separate submit() since I don't want the page refreshing,</p>

A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.</p>

<p>But the foreach errors.</p>

<p>How can I something similar to what I have done, but store multiple values from one chosen option?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I have got the form working using the GET method:</p>

<p><strong>JSP looks like this:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method=""get"" action=""Login""&gt;
Email:&lt;input name=""email""/&gt;
Password:&lt;input name=""password""/&gt;
&lt;input type=""Submit"" value=""Log in""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>And in the Servlet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>@WebServlet(name = ""Login"", urlPatterns = {""/Login""})
public class Login extends HttpServlet {

/**
* Processes requests for both HTTP
* &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; and
* &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; methods.
*
* @param request servlet request
* @param response servlet response
* @throws ServletException if a servlet-specific error occurs
* @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs
*/
protected void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
throws ServletException, IOException {
response.setContentType(""text/html;charset=UTF-8"");

//Assign variables from the request parameters
String loginFormEmail = request.getParameter(""email"");
String loginFormPassword = request.getParameter(""password"");
</code></pre>

<p>This code works but it includes the username and password in the URL string, so it's obviously not good practice. I have attempted to do this using POST instead but I've been getting an error. (HTTP Status 405 - HTTP method POST is not supported by this URL)</p>

<p>I need to know how to send parameters from the JSP to the Servlet using POST. I think this may involve using RequestDispatcher object, but all the tutorials I've found explain using RequestDispatcher to send data from the Servlet to the JSP, not the other way around. Can you/should you use Request Dispatcher to send POST data from the JSP to the Servlet? And how to you access these parameters from the Servlet? (Is there an equivalent of request.getParameter() for POST?)</p>

<p>I understand that using POST still won't be secure, but it is a lot better practice than including the password in the query string, and I will think about security later.</p>

<p>Apologies for the basic question, I have found lots of tutorials online but none of them seem to answer this specific question. Thank you.</p>
