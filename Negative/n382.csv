I want the default view to directory list view on the left vertical split pane and the file I double click on will be in the right vertical split pane.  This is much the same in netbeans or eclipse.  Is there anyway to set this to be the default mvim view, or hotkeys to put it in this mode?</p>

<p>on my macbook pro, I can open mvim by typing:</p>

<pre><code>mvim .
</code></pre>

<p>This opens a directory tree view of the current directory (not split pane).  If I double click on any files, the whole screen is replaced with that file and my directory listing goes away.  I want to keep it.</p>

<p>If I highlight a file from within the directory listing and click ""t"" hotkey, a new tab is opened showing the contents of that file (again, not split pane, but whole file in it's own tab).  However, if I highlight a folder and click ""t"" hotkey, a new tab is opened BUT it  has a new vertical split with directory listing on the left.  Furthermore if I double click on the files in that directory listing, they go in the right pane, which is what I want.</p>

<p>Is there any command line arguments that set that up which I can alias?</p>

According to many threads (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10697728/ios-and-bluetooth-low-energy"">one of many</a>) on StackOverflow itself:</p>

<li>Core Bluetooth framework can be used to communicate with <strong>ANY</strong>

<ul>
<li>Artist Name </li>
<li>Artist Biography </li>
<li>Artist Age</li>
</ul>

<p>lets say for example: 100 artists.</p>

<p>Because this data will be modified very rarely, I have created an interface whereby when the data is <strong>modified by the administrator</strong> using the content management system, the system queries the database, and saves a serialized PHP array of the data as a file on the server.</p>

<p>This file is recreated everytime a new artist is added, say once a week.</p>

<p>On the frontend, when the page is loaded instead of querying the database the page simply includes 
the file (using output buffering) and produces the HTML page layout from this object.</p>

<p><strong>Is this a good idea? Is this going to be quicker than having hundreds of users query the database everytime the page loads?</strong> </p>

<p>As an extension to this question, if I start to page the data e.g. set a limit on the MYSQL result object to 10 rows, will it be slower to access the whole table as a PHP array and cut that down into groups of 10 - echoing out the relevant section based on the query string?</p>

<p>When you open the link, <code>pagebeforeshow</code> for <em>page 1</em> is fired. When you click the link to go to <em>page 2</em>, <code>pagebeforeshow</code> for <em>page 2</em> is fired. So far, so good.</p>

<p>If you then use the left button (<code>data-rel=""back""</code>) to go back, excess events are fired. Using the right button instead (direct link to <em>page 1</em>) does what I'd expect, namely, only <code>pagebeforeshow</code> for <em>page 1</em> gets fired.</p>

<p>but I'd appreciate some clarification about what's going on.</p>

<p>alpha, I believe, is a force method that controls the rate at which the force comes to rest, accepting values in the range [0, 1] - higher values cause force to slow to a halt slower, lower values faster.</p>

<p>We then iterate through the original array and increment the x and y locations (which don't exist initially, so these are assigned for the first time on the first iteration of this forEach loop) by k * the x and y components of the focus point. </p>

<p>Ultimately then they'll always be moving towards the designated x and y positions, but how do we guarantee we get them there based on this k value which is itself based on alpha? Is the extent to which the nodes move along the x and y axes controlled by the .1 constant? Setting this higher/lower implies more/less drift towards the focus points?</p>

<p>Finally why do we then transform the nodes? I would understand </p>

<p>node.attr(""cx"", function(d) { return d.x}) and the same for y. Why the transform?</p>

<p>Thanks in adv.</p>

<p>jfiddle - <a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/hiwilson1/dL9r22ny/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jsfiddle.net/hiwilson1/dL9r22ny/</a></p>

<p>UPDATE: I suspect the last part of my question, why we transform the nodes, is because we're moving g elements rather than circle elements and we can't use cx and cy on a g element. Still unsure about why we translate them d.x and d.y though, wouldn't this move them from the arbitrarily assigned d.x and d.y values to effectively double these locations? (if we start at [10, 10] and translate another [10, 10] we end up at [20, 20]?)</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *existingpoints = mapView.annotations;
[mapView removeAnnotations:existingpoints];
                if ([mapView.annotations count] &gt; 0) {

<p>Now the strange bit is that from time to time I can get inside the mapView.annotations count being greater than 0.  So therefore I have extra ""protection"" and try and manually remove the item than gets NSLogged out.  </p>

<p>The majority of the objects are created by the Kafka producer that is written in Scala and consequently uses a lot of immutable objects. Again using YourKit, I've measured that the size of the immutable objects from Kafka is around 75% of the total, and the number of objects from Kafka is around 53% of the total. The vast majority of these objects do not make it past 20 ms.</p>

<p>In an attempt to optimize my application for this use case, I have tried to tune the garbage collector so that it recognizes the short-lived objects as the common use case, and discards of the majority before it reaches the old gen. Here are the knobs I have used so far:</p>

<pre><code>-verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps \
-XX:+PrintHeapAtGC -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution \
-XX:+UseParallelOldGC -XX:NewRatio=1 \
</code></pre>

<p>The most important flags are <code>-XX:NewRatio</code> and <code>-XX:UseParallelOldGC</code> but I am noticing some strange behavior in the GC patterns.</p>

<p>Here's an illustration of the heap usage before the first full GC:
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/9p6Ef.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/9p6Ef.png"" alt=""Heap Usage Transient State""></a></p>

<p>Here's an illustration of the steady state heap usage:<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kQQMK.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kQQMK.png"" alt=""Heap Usage Steady State""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, the tenuring is happening very slowly (I also confirmed this using the heap information printed after each gc) before the first full GC, but after the first full GC, the tenuring starts happening very quickly.</p>

<p>I don't understand the reason for this, and I find the full GCs completely unnecessary - the full GC causes almost the entire heap to be reclaimed because the vast vast majority of objects have already lost their strong reference.</p>

<p>If it would help to include the heap information after each GC, I will do so, but for now, this should be sufficient information.</p>

<p>If anyone has any idea why this could be happening, please let me know. A full GC an hour seems too frequent for such an application.</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>As requested, here is some additional information:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am using Java 7, version 1.7.0_51.</li>
<li>I have allocated 1 GB of memory for this process, and the heap has been fixed at this size. </li>

<p>All methods that I am aware of rely on reading proc_fs:</p>

<ol>
<li>readlink on <code>/proc/$PID/exe</code></li>
<li>reading from <code>/proc/$PID/cmdline</code>, until the first null character</li>
<li>parsing the Name field in <code>/proc/$PID/status</code></li>
</ol>

<p>The first method seems to be reliable, if combined with method #3. Unfortunately, the path gets a <code>(deleted)</code> suffix when the executable is removed from the system, which can be a suffix part of an ordinary file name. The filter can not be robust if such names are used for executables.</p>

<p>The second method is dependent on the shell that started the process. This is just the first (position 0) argument of the process, and IIUC, shells are free to set it in anyway they see fit. For example, bash prepends dash to login shells.</p>

<p>The third method relies on a name truncated to 15 characters, as taken directly from a field in the kernel task_struct. This is obviously not robust, but is the only name available for kernel processes, and thus must supplement the other two. (Apparently, if the name contains non-ASCII characters they appear as escape sequences, so the method is reliable in this way.)</p>

<p>Altogether, I can not come up with a robust, shell-independent way, to support filtering by process executable name (or ideally path), allowing arbitrary file names. I will probably resort to the leading command parameter in cmdline, since it may fit my purposes, but I would like to make sure that I understand the available options.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Security, although an issue, is a different point. Checking the user identity of the process will be done if security is necessary. But what I desire for the name filter is just correctness. The aim is to implement a quality of service or per-process configuration reliably, and process name filtering will be involved.</p>

<p>My question pertains to each of the following scenarios:</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> In the same file as above we have the following code:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VKabR.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The piece I'm struggling with is the Right Content area - shown as the dotted red box above. The contents of this area will vary with individual pages. Sometimes it will be empty in which case the solid red Content should expand to fill the content zone. With content it will typically contain 1 or 2 lists of links - specific to the page.</p>

<p>I tried adding a HTML Text Field to the Page content type but then how do I position it? In the Content template (e.g. from the contoso theme ~/Themes/Contoso/Views/Content.cshtml) we can position Model.Content but not individual fields.</p>

<p>Or, if I add another zone on the right hand side of the layout is there a way to place page fields in other zones outside the Content Zone? I tried this in Placement.info as a test:</p>

<p><code>&lt;Place Fields_Common_Text=""ContentAside""/&gt;</code></p>

<p>but it didn't appear in the Content Aside Zone.</p>

<p>One annoying thing is that when I print <code>pandas.series</code> or <code>pandas.dataframe.info</code>, the result in the IPython notebook can't aligned well. as the image ""poor"" shows. But when I copy the result to the txt editor, it seems to aligned well. So how can I adjust these align in ipython notebook?</p>

<p>Is this something about the custom css of the ipython notebook? Or something about pandas?
sorry I can't post images the poor alignment in my ipython notebook seems like:</p>

<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/0fe5cf9093b21f4f632f"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/0fe5cf9093b21f4f632f</a></p>

<p>I apologize if the code is really bad/adds a few things that don't need to exist as I'm still trying to get used to how everything works as I go along.</p>

<p>I want to have comments for each post that is made on my website - and the logic I have is that users have many comments, and I suppose that the posts have many comments through the users. I do have that relationship added (though it doesn't seem to be doing anything in particular), and I feel as if all of my table references are correct (though I haven't added anything to users as I'm using devise and didn't feel like I needed to add anything as the post is a separate object itself).</p>

<p>As of right now, I can show all of the comments in general, as in I am able to create and save them. I was also saving, at the very least, the <code>user_id</code> variable, so it can understand which account is making the comment. I'm not really sure where/when I should be passing in the <code>post_id</code>, so that's the biggest issue. Any way I've tried to do it in the <code>posts_controller</code> (since in theory I should be able to edit that attribute when the post page is loaded), I get an</p>

<pre><code>undefined method 'post_id'
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>no post_id column
</code></pre>

<p>error, indicating that it doesn't exist, even though as far as I understand, I've defined it. The fact that the <code>user_id</code> is able to be saved, as mentioned before, further confuses me.</p>

<p>If I show the attributes on a comment created in my show view, I get the following:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""id""=&gt;1,
    ""content""=&gt;""text here"",
    ""posted""=&gt;Sat, 03 Nov 2012 20:36:53 UTC +00:00,
    ""user_id""=&gt;1,
    ""created_at""=&gt;Sat, 03 Nov 2012 20:36:53 UTC +00:00,
    ""updated_at""=&gt;Sat, 03 Nov &gt;2012 20:36:53 UTC +00:00
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is no <code>post_id</code>, although I did add it into the migration table for comments. Trying to pass the <code>@post.id</code> in the posts controller (to a show method's instance of a comment, as it would be available beneath a post) gives a mass assignment error. Messing around with the <code>:class</code> and <code>:foreign_key</code> options hasn't done much, either. Based on the research I have done, which includes some of Rails' own documentation, I don't believe I need a <code>has_many</code> through relationship, but I don't know where I'm missing what I need to have the information save accordingly.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is all due in part to my lacking understanding of database/model relationship design, although any help is appreciated. I have seen a couple of similar questions but I still find it difficult to apply their solutions to the context of my own particular issue.</p>

Anakin wins a thrilling Podrace and with it his freedom as he leaves his home to be trained as a Jedi. The heroes return to Naboo where Anakin and the Queen face massive invasion forces while the two Jedi contend with a deadly foe named Darth Maul. Only then do they realize the invasion is merely the first step in a sinister scheme by the re-emergent forces of darkness known as the Sith.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Ten years after the invasion of Naboo, the galaxy is on the brink of civil war. Under the leadership of a renegade Jedi named Count Dooku, thousands of solar systems threaten to break away from the Galactic Republic. When an assassination attempt is made on Senator Padmé Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, twenty-year-old Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect her. In the course of his mission, Anakin discovers his love for Padmé as well as his own darker side. Soon, Anakin, Padmé, and Obi-Wan Kenobi are drawn into the heart of the Separatist movement and the beginning of the Clone Wars.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Years after the onset of the Clone Wars, the noble Jedi Knights lead a massive clone army into a galaxy-wide battle against the Separatists. When the sinister Sith unveil a thousand-year-old plot to rule the galaxy, the Republic crumbles and from its ashes rises the evil Galactic Empire. Jedi hero Anakin Skywalker is seduced by the dark side of the Force to become the Emperor's new apprentice -- Darth Vader. The Jedi are decimated, as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Master Yoda are forced into hiding. The only hope for the galaxy are Anakin's own offspring -- the twin children born in secrecy who will grow up to become heroes.&lt;/p&gt;

Obi-Wan begins Luke's Jedi training as Luke joins him on a daring mission to rescue the beautiful Rebel leader Princess Leia from the clutches of the evil Empire. Although Obi-Wan sacrifices himself in a lightsaber duel with Darth Vader, his former apprentice, Luke proves that the Force is with him by destroying the Empire's dreaded Death Star.&lt;/p&gt;

After the Rebellion's defeat on the ice planet Hoth, Luke journeys to the planet Dagobah to train with Jedi Master Yoda, who has lived in hiding since the fall of the Republic. In an attempt to convert Luke to the dark side, Darth Vader lures young Skywalker into a trap in the Cloud City of Bespin. In the midst of a fierce lightsaber duel with the Sith Lord, Luke faces the startling revelation that the evil Vader is in fact his father, Anakin Skywalker.&lt;/p&gt;

Luke Skywalker confronts his father Darth Vader in a final climactic duel before the evil Emperor. In the last second, Vader makes a momentous choice: he destroys the Emperor and saves his son. The Empire is finally defeated, the Sith are destroyed, and Anakin Skywalker is thus redeemed. At long last, freedom is restored to the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>In the screenshot below, you can see that the text is inserted after the fact (this is what needs to happen) and appears highlighted in blue - I have no idea where to begin on how to make it just appear as normal, non-highlighted text. When clicking on it, it appears normally. In the bottom left corners of each edit control, one can see a square which should not be appearing there. Also, you can see some artifacts of what looks like to be a combo box dropdown selection appearing in the larger boxes.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/uwCoo.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I would appreciate any pointers on how to get rid of the artifacts and fix the highlighting issue with inserted text.</p>

"30146853","1","","","2015-05-10 01:46:58","","0","220","<p>I'm developing portlets with WebSphere Portal8.0 and am testing a new customized theme that is based on the Portal8.0 default theme having the Full profile.  I created four portal pages with each one displaying a single portlet.  The horizontal navigation menu at the top of the browser is the auto-generated navigation menu provided by the theme.   When I switch from one portal page to another, there is considerable lag time, about 5 seconds before I see any response in Firebug, and then the whole page goes blank for up to two seconds, and then finally loads the new page.  I expected only the body part of the browser that displays the contents of the current page to refresh, not the whole page including the header banner and navigation menu.  What could be causing this?  </p>

<p>Is there a particular theme resource or configuration file that is causing this?  Could it be a setting in the Portal itself, separate from the theme?   I have the Firebug console open when testing and notice that the same dojo1.7 modules are reloaded each time.  Why aren't the dojo1.7 modules cached?  I verified from the Portal admin console that each portal page enables cacheing for 24hrs, and I also verified that each portlet itself also enables a 24hr cache.   I also verified that the Firefox browser has 250MB cache enabled.  </p>

<p>I created and packaged the Portal8.0 based customized theme into a single WAR file.  In my customized theme, I have customized the theme_en.html, Default.jsp, and commonActions.jsp files.   I've begun trying to slowly revert the changes I made to each of those file with the hope that I'll discover the particular customization that is causing the significant lag, but so far am not seeing it.  </p>

<p>Am I on the right track?  Could the lag be due to the customized theme files?  Here are the customized theme files:</p>

<p>NOTE: I had early on set the trace string ""com.ibm.wps.resourceaggregator.CombinerDataSource.RemoteDebug=all"" through the Integrated Solutions Console as per article: <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.0.0/dev/csa2t_trble_tracemod.dita"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.0.0/dev/csa2t_trble_tracemod.dita</a>  which causes the portal to load the uncompressed js and css files, to help during configuring of the custom theme, but in an effort to load the faster compressed versions, have now removed that trace string and am seeing errors in Firebug console directly tied to having this trace string removed.  The initial two errors are:</p>

<p>I am told this is a concurrency exception but I am always the only user of the database so it can't be. I've checked the primary key of the data object returned has the correct primary key.</p>

    }

<p>The (much abreviated) process we are using client side is to initially 'synch' the data, store locally and update any changes later.</p>

<p>Firstlyt, load data and store in local storage:</p>

<pre><code>  var jobsQuery = new breeze.EntityQuery.from(""Jobs"");
  em.fetchMetadata().then(function () {
  em.executeQuery(jobsQuery).then(function (data) {
     _jobs = data.results;
     var emCache = em.exportEntities();
     store.setItem(""EmCache"", emCache);
     }, function (data) {
        deferred.reject(data); // passes back unsuccessful
     });
     }, function (data) {
        console.log(data);
        deferred.reject(data); // passes back unsuccessful
  });
</code></pre>

<p>then when they press synch later we issue:</p>

<pre><code>                em.saveChanges().then(function () {
                    deferred.resolve();
                }, function (error) {
                    // fail promise
                    console.log(error);
                    deferred.reject(error.message); 
                });
</code></pre>

<p>where we always get the error above. The data model is quite complex, though the change I am making is trivial. Apologies the code sample is brief but its from a much larger project with many dependencies. I've unpicked the main points. Any help or clues on where to look as to why this is happening would be appreciated, there doesn't seem to be much out there on this subject.</p>

<p>the first one is pretty easy since the first li is always a top-level list element.  i'm confused about targeting the last one since there could be a sub-menu on the last top-level list element.  </p>

<p>there was no solution selected, but per some of the responses at : <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8515847/how-to-add-class-into-last-li-of-first-level"">how to add class into last li of first level</a> </p>

<p>i've tried the following, which works on the first item, but adds the ""last"" class to ""Test Tag"" and all its children, whereas I only want this class added to the ""Test Tag"" li.  </p>

<pre><code>$​(""#primary-menu &gt; li:first"").addClass(""first"");
$(""#primary-menu &gt; li:last"").addClass(""last"");

And this is what I've experienced for the last two weeks I've been working on this project.  I change the model, delete the MDF, and rerun the project.  When I forget to delete the MDF, upon accessing the controller, the exception reminds me that the entity framework cannot recreate the database since it already exists.  This reminds me to delete the MDF, and all is well again.</p>

<p>At some point today, things changed.  Now, it attempts to recreate the database every time I run the project.<br>
Here's what I've done to validate I'm having a new problem...</p>

<p>I delete the MDF to start fresh.
Run the project, hit the controller, which creates the MDF, then stop the project.<br>
I then immediate run the project again... no code changes whatsoever.
I get the ""Additional information: Cannot create file '....mdf' because it already exists. Change the file path or the file name, and retry the operation."" (removed the actual mdf file name here for brevity).</p>

<p>I don't understand why it keeps trying to recreate the DB even when no model changes have occurred.  Any ideas what's going on?  I've restarted VS and Windows, but to no avail.  I'd sure appreciate any ideas/suggestions on what to check next.</p>

<p>I have a set of users who make client visits, each client may be visited more than once and my table records the date the visit was made (but not whether this was the first,second,third etc visit). So my table looks like:</p>

<pre><code>clientid   visitdate
100        10-apr-2012
101        15-apr-2012
101        25-apr-2012
102        26-apr-2012
100        28-apr-2012
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm looking to find out is how many (e.g.) second visits were made  for a given date period. So in the data above, there are 3 first visits and 2 second visits.</p>

<p>I'm assuming I need to use something like the @rownum functionality, like this:</p>

<p>SELECT visitdate, clientid @rownum := @rownum + 1 as row from visit, (SELECT @rownum := 0) a
ORDER BY clientid,visitdate</p>

<p>which gives me:</p>

<pre><code>clientid   visitdate     row
100        10-apr-2012   1
100        28-apr-2012   2
101        15-apr-2012   3
101        25-apr-2012   4
102        26-apr-2012   5
</code></pre>

<p>but what I'm really looking for is:</p>

<pre><code>clientid   visitdate     row
100        10-apr-2012   1
100        28-apr-2012   2
101        15-apr-2012   1
101        25-apr-2012   2
102        26-apr-2012   1
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm having trouble figuring out is how to reset the row counter for each clientid.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm approaching this in the wrong way, and I can do these calculations in the application (PHP) code, but it feels like something that should be achievable within the db.</p>

<p>I've seen approaches for SQLServer (eg: <a href=""http://www.sqlmonster.com/Uwe/Forum.aspx/sql-server-programming/74891/Auto-number-and-reset-based-on-data-value-in-a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqlmonster.com/Uwe/Forum.aspx/sql-server-programming/74891/Auto-number-and-reset-based-on-data-value-in-a</a>), but doesn't seem this works for mysql?</p>

<p>How does one debug this?  I am using firefox with firebug, my app is using PHP with javascript.</p>

<p>EDIT: it's almost as if the onComplete is being missed by java, and it just dumps it as the user is signing in.... it only happens when someone is changing pages and the java is running at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> If you want to see this for yourself,  you'll need visit my site and create an account and go through the signup process (2-3 mins to do tops), the website is <a href=""http://mikesandmegs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mikesandmegs.com</a> and the beta password is <strong>goldfish</strong>. What you want to do is login just as the check mail sends its request off. Its like I need to cancel something or tell java to throw the callback out or something. You should see the requests every 5 seconds, (well it adds 5 seconds each request) but you'll see.  <strong>It may take a couple try's or some luck, but it is reproducible.</strong></p>

<p>This is the javascript that is running (i think I have it all posted) If I seem to be missing anything, let me know.  I also posted an htnl input html that the javascript checks...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id=""hasMail"" type=""hidden"" value=""y""&gt;

&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
    mailTimer = setInterval(""checkMail();"", 10000);

function checkMail()
{
	// should we check the mail now?
	if ($('hasMail').value == ""y"")
	{
		// remove mail new mail alert (mail-check.php returns y or n
		new Ajax.Request('mail-check.php', 
		{ 
			method: 'post', 
			postBody: '',
			onComplete: checkMailNotify 
		});
	}
}

    function checkMailNotify(req)
    {
    	if (req.responseText.length &gt; 5)
    	{
    		$('hasMail').value = ""n"";

    		clearInterval (mailTimer);
    	}

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;

It seems to me that, whenever I invoke this method, it uses <code>seekg</code> to start counting the bytes from the beginning all the way to the end and get the size using <code>tellg</code>. I came up with this design to save some IO time in the first place, but: isn't this continuous counting impose a larger cost(if the number of calls to this method is high and log messages are small as in most of the cases)?</p>

<p>is there a better way to do this?</p>

<p>And a side question: is <code>1MB</code> a good number for buffer size in a normal nowadays computers?</p>

    *e2 = tmp;

void sortWords( char (* words2Darray)[10], unsigned short length ) {

        // Compare and move the word to the correct position

"11351176","1","","","2012-07-05 19:25:15","","2","207","<p>For the last few days I've been trying to build a simple load/save system for a game using Core Data. Either I'm totally missing something (read: <em>I'm blind and/or stupid</em>) or Core Data just isn't made for what I want to do with it.</p>

<p>Saving, loading and creating my UIManagedDocument works fine. Setting and loading values for attributes in my savegame entity works fine as well.</p>

<p>The problem is that these values are lost when my app quits, because I don't know how to access them.</p>

<p>I have about 200 attributes inside my savegame entity, such as (NSNumber *)currentIncome, <code>NSNumber *currentMoney, NSNumber *currentMonth</code> etc. Seems simple, right? If I were to group these into attributes with relationships, I'd probably end up with about 20 attributes. From what I gathered from the Core Data Programming Guide, in order to fill the entity with the values from my saved UIManagedDocument, I need to perform a fetchrequest with a predicate which fills an array of results.</p>

<p>This is where my first question arises: Would I need to perform a fetchrequest for every single attribute? This seems useful if you only have a few attributes or if you have 'to many' relationships. In my case, this would seem incredibly tedious though.</p>

<p>I might be missing something very essential here, but I would need something like <code>load my UIManagedDocument and automatically fill my NSManagedModel with the one that was saved in the document's context</code> and I cannot find it.</p>

<p>That is where my second question comes in: Is CoreData and UIManagedDocument even the right approach for this? 200 variables is too much for NSUserDefaults - I could imagine using NSCoding though. I definately want to incorporate iCloud savegame sharing at a later point, and UIManagedDocument and CoreData just seemed perfect for this.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Turns out I was blind and/or stupid. I just rewrote the entire Core Data fetching code (20 lines down to 10 or so).
Performing a fetchrequest for an entity without a predicate apparently returns the entire entity. 
If my <code>(NSArray *)</code>fetchedResults turns up nil (<em>database is empty</em>), I insert a new instance of my savegame entity in my managedobjectcontext.
If it turns up non-nil, i just do a <code>(NSManagedObject *)saveGame = [fetchedResults lastObject]</code> and every value gets loaded fine.</p>

<p>If anybody is interested, I'll post the entire code later today.</p>

<p>and no matter what the resolution of my screen, only the min-height : 1600px and max 4000px works, if I am not mistaken i can use height as a parameter correct? I also do not think there is a syntax issue. has anyone had this problem?</p>

<p><em>""i have code in domain A that is also useful in domain B but not in business services - where should i put the stuff with its tests"".</em> </p>

<p>let's assume the code is very abstract and domain agnostic, something very generic that could also be used by the ""other"" applications outside of soa.</p>

<p>so the question is:</p>

<p>a) put it in a ""generic-domain-stuff"" module which all domain inherit via maven dependencies. This will probably end up growing and growing until it is a mess….</p>

<p>b) create a module ""generic-stuff"" which can be used by soa and the ""other"" applications. This will probably lead to a lot of small maven modules….</p>

<p>c) duplicate the code until you have three use cases, then refactor to a) or b). This screems DRY (don't repeat yourself)</p>

I've organised my folder structures in a personal yet mobile state so that I can copy it across to another computer and resume without any extra set-up.</p>

<p>However, whenever compiling I'm receiving issues including files.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>spaaace\source\xmlparser.h(4): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'TinyXML\tinyxml.h': No such file or directory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I figured I must have forgotten to update the 'additional include directories' (which by the way, there is only one), but no, still the same issue.</p>

<p>This seems like such a simple little issue and I'm sure I'll slap myself in the face once I find the cause. I've spent over half an hour trying to fix it, Google it, and so forth.</p>

<p>To clarify, my project structure is somewhat like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>base\include\SFML</p>
  
  <p>base\include\TinyXML</p>
  
  <p>base\project\debug</p>
  
  <p>base\project\release</p>
  
  <p>base\project\project\source\</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With all my actual source files in the last one.
I've selected the include folder at least half a dozen times now via 'C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories' with no change.</p>

<p>I've tried including the folder about 20 different ways and the only one that seems to work is using a complete path (e.g. C:\users\admin\desktop\project\include) which seems impractical. I also find it impractical having to dump the entire include directory into my project which defeats the purpose of it in the first place.</p>

<p>I've tried:
></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>include ""tinyxml.h""</p>
  
  <p>include ""TinyXML/tinyxml.h""</p>
  
  <p>include ""include/TinyXML/tinyxml.h""</p>
  
  <p>include ""../TinyXML/tinyxml.h""</p>
  
  <p>include ""../../TinyXML/tinyxml.h""</p>
  
  <p>include ""../include/TinyXML/tinyxml.h""</p>
  
  <p>include ""../include/TinyXML/tinyxml.h""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and so forth, as well as using &lt;>s instead of """"s.</p>

<p>Just one more note, it's not just TinyXML that's having this issue, SFML too; it's not file specific.</p>

<p>And after scouring the internet for hours over the past couple days, I have not found a solution. I can't exactly tell you what it's not because it's hard to remember what I've already tried, but most of the articles/other questions I looked at weren't even applicable. </p>

<p>So why is this exception occurring and how can I fix it?</p>

I'm using mysql &amp; php. Loads of googleing only shows how to count how many times a value appears in several rows, I want check for a value in many different columns but in the same record. (I think this: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4286711/count-number-of-columns-that-have-data-for-each-row"">count number of columns that have data for each row</a> just might be about the same thing, maybe? but I don't get it.)</p>

<p>I have a table with goals that I hope to work on and achieve every day. So for every day I wish to mark: ""success"" or ""fail"". And insert is working great. How ever I'm looking for a way to calculate the number of success&amp; number of fails of ""today"", to show the right kind of smiley which will be encouraging or sad depending on number of fails and number of successes.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>ID  date          drinkMoreWater    goToBedEarlier    callADearFriend
1   2012 jan 15   fail              fail              fail
1   2012 jan 16   success           _(still empty)    success

<p>So if today is jan 15 the smiley will be very very sad.
If today is jan 16 the smiley will be really really hppy with stars in it's eye's (atleast until I fail goal 2  ;)  )</p>

<p>The form is sent via jquery and ajax to another controller function called <code>get_markers()</code> which queries the database successfully and returns an array of values including lng, lat and name which I need to pass back to my view. </p>

<p>The array is called <code>markerDetails</code> and when I do a <code>var_dump($query-&gt;result());</code> I can see that my query was a success.</p>

<p>I am new to using Codeigniter and the problem I have is caused because the form handling and database query are done in a separate controller function to the one that loads the map view. The <code>maps()</code> function creates the maps and <code>get_markers()</code>deals with the database query based on the form data submitted from the <code>mapsView</code> page.</p>

<p>I have tried moving all the code from the <code>get_markers()</code> controller function into the  <code>maps()</code> controller function but when I do the <code>var_dump($query-&gt;result());</code> returns everything in the table and not just the results of my query.</p>

<p>My main problem is that I need the results from my database query in the <code>mapsView</code> page but I cant reload the page because I will lose all the settings for my map.</p>

<p>The form is on the mapView page and is a standard radio button form with a hidden field that has a value for the location. on submit the form passes a value for the location and also for a type that has been picked via the radio buttons.</p>

<p>I am unsure how to approach this problem because the MVC method of doing things is new to me and am wondering if someone could point me in the right direction. </p>

When the service is called by a client running on the .NET 2.0 runtime, the operation fails with a 403.  If I examine the request in wireshark I see that the client is responding to the <strong>Certificate Request</strong> frame with a <strong>Certificate</strong> frame but no certificate is specified in that frame.  Looking at the list of CA certificates provided by the server in <strong>Certificate Request</strong> the CA used by the client's certificate is not present.  This seem to make sense as what is the point of sending a cert if the service will not trust it.  However, when I make this same call using the tool recompiled against the .NET 4.0 runtime the behavior is different.  The client's <strong>Certificate</strong> frame does contain the certificate it was configured to use.  I saw on the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171868%28v=vs.100%29.aspx#networking"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN</a> that changes were made to SslStream so is this what I am running into?

Within each request, I am sending about six to ten total Strings back and forth. Say a user logs in, clicks around ten times, it is not uncommon for that user to have created ten socket connections causing the transaction of ~80 Strings between server and client. I notice absolutely zero performance issues with my one connection as I test. </p>

<p>Before I advance any further, I want to make sure this isn't a terrible design. Imagine I had 500 users, all click ten times in ten seconds total... that's (500 * 10 * ~8) 40,000 Strings being sent or received in 10 seconds.</p>

<p>If I proceed with this method, is it possible to run into issues down the road? I am not factoring in hardware, strictly numbers here. </p>

<p>A possible solution, if this is a problem, is to take those 3-5 Strings, and send them as one. Then the server will separate them, and respond accordingly. This is my first stab at a server/ client concept, so I am really unsure on how to move forward. Perhaps there are standards that are known to preform the best.</p>

<p>Old DB:</p>

<pre><code>[""C""]=&gt;
string(23) ""3874163,3874197,3874201""
</code></pre>

<p>New DB:</p>

<pre><code>[""C""]=&gt;
resource(182) of type (stream)
</code></pre>

<p>Now when reading the streams sometimes there is an error of a non-existing stream resource beeing referenced and everything fails. I'm guessing the connection closed in the meantime without the stream beeing read and therefore the access is lost.</p>

<p>When changing the statements to include a casting against varchar for example:</p>

<pre><code>CONVERT(VARCHAR, C, 120)
</code></pre>

<p>Or like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT TO_CHAR(FUNC())
</code></pre>

<p>The value is returned as a string again but this is not really an optimal solution as every statement would need to be changed.</p>

<p>Is there any way/option to prevent LOBs from beeing delivered as streams so they are instead delivered as strings like in Oracle 10g?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>
We are using the oci function-set for db access.</p>

#   their path using -Lpath, something like:
LFLAGS = -L/Users/MY_NAME/Projects/Tank\ Game/Webcam_Tests/Webcam_Test_v1/lib

# define any libraries to link into executable:
#   if I want to link in libraries (libx.so or libx.a) I use the -llibname 
#   option, something like (this will link in libmylib.so and libm.so:
LIBS = -l libopencv_core.dylib  -lm

# define the C source files
SRCS = Webcam_Test_v1.c

# define the C object files 
#
# This uses Suffix Replacement within a macro:

<p>I wrote a query like:</p>

<pre><code>var reportalerts = pushDB.ReportAlerts

                         .Take(numResultsPerPage);
</code></pre>

<p>This creates the SQL that I'd expect:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT TOP (5) [t0].[Title], [t0].[Url], [t0].[DateStamp]
FROM [dbo].[ReportAlerts] AS [t0]
ORDER BY [t0].[DateStamp]
</code></pre>

<p>If I then add an extra property to my anonymous type, the sql generated is radically different:</p>

<pre><code>var reportalerts = pushDB.ReportAlerts
                         .Select(p =&gt; new {p.Title, p.Url, p.DateStamp, p.Text})
                         .OrderBy(p =&gt; p.DateStamp)
                         .Take(numResultsPerPage);
</code></pre>

<p>Becomes:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT TOP (5) [t0].[Title], [t0].[Url], [t0].[DateStamp], [t0].[PushReportAlertID], [t0].[DateOfAlert], [t0].[AlertProductID], [t0].[Description], [t0].[Mpid], [t0].[UIName], [t0].[CustomerDesc], [t0].[ProductArea]
FROM [dbo].[ReportAlerts] AS [t0]
ORDER BY [t0].[DateStamp]
</code></pre>

<p>That is it takes every column from the table now. It's like it has decided, this guy is selecting enough columns for me to just go and grab all of them now. This is a problem for me as I want to concat (i.e. UNION ALL) the query with a similar one from another table which has different columns. (before the order by/take) If it would take only the columns that are specified by my anonymous type properties it would not be a problem, but as it takes all the columns and the two tables have differing columns, it fails.</p>

<p>I can solve the problem in various different ways, so I'm not stopped by this, I just want to understand what is happening above, and if there is not a way you can get it to just return the columns you want.</p>

<p>I have certain restrictions, and the top part was a bit of a hack, but it works.  test only evaluates to either 0 or -1.</p>

<p>The assignment uses a specific compiler, and in the case of x = 0, y = -2147483648, and z = 2147483647, the compiler states that my code is returning -2147483648.</p>

<p>That wouldn't make sense since if x = 0, then test = 0.  If test = 0, then the ans expression will evaluate to z, i.e., 2147483647.</p>

<p>I have double-checked my outputs on two different compilers and it says I am returning 2147483647, the correct answer, so I'm left to assume this is a compiler error, perhaps related to the bounds of an integer?  Unless of course, the fault is in my code.</p>

<p>Also additional compiler info:
The compiler is called the dlc compiler.  I previously had ""parse error"" issues declaring my variables in the middle of my functions, and I was told the compiler was likely C89.  Moving these declarations to the top of the function fixed the problem.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
changing the negOne expression to ~1 + 1 did not fix anything.
I evaluated both sides of the ans expressions and, as expected, they evaluated to 0 and 2147483647, respectively, so that does not seem to be the problem either. The express would then finally evaluate 0 | 2147483647, which is 2147483647; and that's what the value of ans is, and I also checked the value of the variable receiving the return value of the function, and again, it is 2147483647.</p>

<p>The information I have found on MSDN shows how this can be done by adding code that calls Trace.Flush() and adding sources, switches and sharedlisteners, however I would like to continue using auto-flush and not alter the code.</p>

The column (ntext) I need to update contains a mix of regular text/comments and guid's. </p>

<p>Searching for ways to determine if some text is a uniqueidentifier/guid in SQL gave multiple solutions like som regex, but for some reason that did not remove all entries of guids from the select statement.

Another statement removing any whitespace as first step</p>

<p>SELECT * from TABLE

I have been downloading a .java-file from the internet.
It's pretty messy, and I have cleaned a lot of the code with Java Docs in mind.</p>

<p><strong>However:</strong><br>
The author of the code seems to practice three to four different ways of writing the for-loop, making it super-hard for me to debug.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1 (This is the form I like):</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++) {</code><br>
  <code>. . //Action inside the for-loop.</code><br>
  <code>}</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Example 2 (I can understand this one):</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++) //Action inside the for-loop.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Example 3 (It becomes harder...):</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++)</code><br>
  <code>. .  //Line 1</code><br>
  <code>//Line 2</code><br>
  <code>//Line 3</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Example 4 (I'm totally lost):</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++)</code><br>
  <code>. . //Line 1</code></p>
  
  <p><code>//Line 2</code><br>
  <code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++) //Line 3</code></p>
  
  <p><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++)</code><br>
  <code>. . //Line 4</code></p>
  
  <p><code>//Line 5</code><br>
  <code>//Line 6</code></p>
  
  <p><code>//Line 7</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question</strong><br>
The for-loop format i name ""Example 1"" is so clean; it got brackets and is tabbed.
Why are they using the other formats? Are they cooler than the first example?
How are the for-loops in example 4 working? Are they inside each other?</p>

<p>Thanks for your time and answers.</p>

"28993556","1","28998834","","2015-03-11 17:37:09","","1","101","<p>Imagine that you have n sets of elements in a tuple. For example the tuple could be</p>

<pre><code>std::tuple&lt;topBottomStr, topBottomStr, topBottomStr&gt; or
std::tuple&lt;fraction, fraction, fraction&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So maybe there is some template that represents ""topbottomthings""</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;
class TopBottomThing
{
private:
    T top;
    T bottom;
};
</code></pre>

<p>The point is that what is in the tuple has a notion of a top and a bottom. My question is, I need a function that returns an </p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;std::tuple&lt;TopBottomThing&gt;&gt; ArrangeTopBottomThingFunc(std::vector&lt;std::tuple&lt;TopBottomThing&gt;&gt; tup)
</code></pre>

<p>where the items in the return value </p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;std::tuple&lt;TopBottomThing&gt;&gt; retVal;
</code></pre>

<p>are arranged so that each consecutive entry's TopBottomThing, the bottom of <code>std::vector&lt;n&gt;</code> matches the top of <code>std::vector&lt;n + 1&gt;</code>, matches the bottom of <code>std::vector&lt;n + 2&gt;</code> etc, <strong>or</strong> the top of <code>std::vector&lt;n&gt;</code> matches the top of <code>std::vector&lt;n + 1&gt;</code>, <strong>or</strong> the bottom of <code>std::vector&lt;n&gt;</code> matches the bottom of <code>std::vector&lt;n + 1&gt;</code>. Only one case is guaranteed to happen as a constraint to the function. If the length of the input vector is n, either 0 matches or n - 1 matches are guaranteed.</p>

<p>For example, if <code>std::vector&lt;std::tuple&lt;TopBottomThing&gt;&gt;</code> tup represents standard fractions:</p>

<p>2/3 4/5 3/2,</p>

<p>ArrangeTopBottomThingFunc with that <code>std::vector&lt;tup&gt;</code> as input would return a <strong>sorted by this criterion</strong> an std::vector like this:</p>

<p>[0] = 3/2 [1] = 2/3 [2] = 4/5 (two matches top/bottom)</p>

<p>of if std::tuple tup had these fractions:</p>

<p>4/7 3/2 1/2</p>

<p>[0] = 3/2 [1] = 1/2 [2] = 4/7 (two matches bottom/bottom)</p>

<p>or </p>

<p>4/5 7/8 4/6</p>

<p>[0] 4/5 [1] = 4/6 [2] = 7/8 (two matches top/top)</p>

<p>or the degenerate case</p>

<p>4/5 6/3 2/7 (no matches)</p>

<p>would return in the order given.</p>

<p>or say std::tuple tup represents strings like this</p>

<p>""Straberry/Banana"" ""Blueberry/Kiwi"" ""Kiwi/Banana""</p>

<p>[0] = ""Kiwi/Banana"" [1] = ""Straberry/Banana"" [2] = ""Blueberry/Kiwi""</p>

<p>At least two of the three (n) top or bottom are guaranteed to match. It would be great if the algorithm worked for any length of</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;std::tuple&lt;TopBottomThing&gt;&gt; input. 
</code></pre>

<p>It simply sorts and returns an std::vector those things whose top/top or bottom/bottom or top/bottom match in ascending order. The rest that don't match in this way are simply added in any order.</p>

<p>Finally, it would be nice if the calling function understood how the thing was sorted by returning an enum like this:</p>

<pre><code>enum class WHICHSORT { NO_MATCHES, BOTH_TOP, BOTH_BOTTOM, MIXED_TOP_BOTTOM };

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Input ID creates problems&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;style type=""text/css""&gt;
   #prologue, #summary { margin: 5em; }
  &lt;/style&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Input ID creates a bug&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p id=""prologue""&gt;
   In this example, I make a list of checkboxes representing things which could appear in a book. If you want some in your book, you check them:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;form&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;input type=""checkbox"" id=""prologue"" /&gt;
     &lt;label for=""prologue""&gt;prologue&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;input type=""checkbox"" id=""chapter"" /&gt;
     &lt;label for=""chapter""&gt;chapter&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;input type=""checkbox"" id=""summary"" /&gt;
     &lt;label for=""summary""&gt;summary&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;input type=""checkbox"" id=""etc"" /&gt;
     &lt;label for=""etc""&gt;etc&lt;/label&gt;
     &lt;label&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;p id=""summary""&gt;
   For each checkbox, I want to assign an ID so that clicking a label checks the corresponding checkbox. The problems occur when other elements in the page already use those IDs. In this case, a CSS declaration was made to add margins to the two paragraphs which IDs are ""prologue"" and ""summary"", but because of the IDs given to the checkboxes, the checkboxes named ""prologue"" and ""summary"" are also affected by this declaration. The following links simply call a javascript function which writes out the element whose id is &lt;a href=""javascript:alert(document.getElementById('prologue'));""&gt;prologue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""javascript:alert(document.getElementById('summary'));""&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. In the first case (prologue), the script writes out [object HTMLParagraphElement], because the first element found with id ""prologue"" is a paragraph. But in the second case (summary), the script writes out [object HTMLInputElement] because the first element found with id ""summary"" is an input. In the case of another script, the consequences of this mix up could have been much more dramatic. Now try clicking on the label prologue in the list above. It does not check the checkbox as clicking on any other label. This is because it finds the paragraph whose ID is also ""prologue"" and tries to check that instead. By the way, if there were another checkbox whose id was ""prologue"", then clicking on the label would check the one which appears first in the code.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   An easy fix for this would be to chose other IDs for the checkboxes, but this doesn't apply if these IDs are given dynamically, by a php script for example.
   Another easy fix for this would be to write labels like this:
   &lt;pre&gt;
    &amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&amp;lt;input type=""checkbox"" /&amp;gt;prologue&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
   &lt;/pre&gt;
   and not need to give an ID to the checkboxes. But this only works if the label and checkbox are next to each other.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Well, that's the problem. I guess the ideal solution would be to link a label to a checkboxe using another mechanism (not using ID). I think the perfect way to do this would be to match a label to the input element whose NAME (not ID) is the same as the label's FOR attribute. What do you think?
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

    import tempfile
    import os
    filename = tempfile.mkstemp()[1]
    f = open(filename, 'w')

<p>One solution I was thinking of was using a different media folder for tests which must be kept synced with the test fixtures. Is there any way to specify another media directory in <code>settings.py</code> when tests are being run? And can I include some sort of hook to dumpdata so that it syncs the files in the media folders?</p>

<p>However, if I place the same metadata file under <strong>FOS/UserBundle/Resources/config/serializer</strong> (in the vendor bundle) and change the configuration to:</p>

<pre><code>jms_serializer:
  metadata:
    debug: true
    file_cache:

    #    path: ""@MyBundle/config/serializer/fosuser""
</code></pre>

<p>The serialization metadata is read and properly applied.</p>

Now that I have this list, I would like to use the models to generate values in another data.frame.</p>

<p>The list contains a model for each <code>DAY</code> and <code>variable</code> subset. I would like to apply the model to the same subsets in another data.frame.  For example, for <code>DAY</code> == 1 and variable == <code>Var.1</code> the model (y = mx+b) is <code>value = -4.521869(Location) + 21.315</code>. Using the model for the appropriate subsets, I would calculate values for <code>Var.1</code> in another data.frame (e.g. <code>dat_rec</code> which already has entries for <code>DAY</code> and <code>Location</code>).</p>

<p>Is there a way to use the models from the list on the same subsets in another data.frame (e.g. use the model to for <code>DAY</code> == 1 and <code>variable</code> == Var.1 to populate values in the data.frame everywhere[e.g. different <code>Sites</code>] <code>DAY</code> == 1 and <code>variable</code> == Var.1) Is there a similar list method to populate a data.frame with the values calculated using the models from the list?

Just a little introduction so you know what my application is right now : I have a UITableView which is created in IB and linked in my class ViewController.h and a UINavigationController created in the appDelegate.h. All the items in the tableView can be clicked and it will slide to another viewController but this part is not important for now. I'm just trying to support rotation in the main view for now.</p>

<p>I create the UINavigationController in my AppDelegate.h like this:</p>

<pre><code>@interface AppDelegate : UIResponder &lt;UIApplicationDelegate&gt;
{
    UINavigationController *navigation;
}
@property (strong, nonatomic) UIWindow *window;
@property (strong, nonatomic) UIViewController *viewController;
</code></pre>

<p>And then in AppDelegate.m I do this :</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];
    self.viewController = [[ViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""MainViewController"" bundle:nil];
    self.window.rootViewController = self.viewController;
    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
    [[UIDevice currentDevice] beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications];

    return YES;
}

- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application
{
    ViewController *viewController = [[ViewController alloc] init]; 
    viewController.title = @""Agrinuvo"";
    [navigation pushViewController:viewController animated:NO];
    navigation = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:viewController];
    navigation.navigationBar.tintColor = [UIColor darkGrayColor];
    [[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setTintColor:[UIColor orangeColor]];

    [_window addSubview:navigation.view];
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried in my ViewController.m viewDidLoad method these :</p>

<pre><code>self.navigationController.navigationBar.autoresizesSubviews = YES;
self.navigationController.navigationBar.autoresizingMask =  UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleLeftMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleRightMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleTopMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleBottomMargin;
</code></pre>

<p>I am able to resize the UINavigationBar but I cannot rotate it for the life of me (still in ViewController.m) :</p>

<pre><code>-(void) orientationChanged
{
CGRect frame = self.navigationController.navigationBar.frame;
if ([[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation] == UIDeviceOrientationPortrait)
{
    self.view.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(0);
    frame.size.height = 44;
    frame.origin.y = 15;
}
if([[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation] == UIDeviceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown)
{
    self.view.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(M_PI * 1);
    frame.size.height = 44;
}
if([[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation] == UIDeviceOrientationLandscapeRight)
{
    self.view.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(M_PI * -0.5);
    frame.size.height = 32;
}
if([[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation] == UIDeviceOrientationLandscapeLeft)
{
    self.view.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(M_PI * 0.5);
    frame.size.height = 32; 
}
self.navigationController.navigationBar.frame = frame;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ah yes, I also tried this method in all of my controllers and it is returning YES in all of them but the NavigationBar still does not rotate.</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation
</code></pre>

<p>So I'm wondering if it is actually possible to rotate a NavigationBar. Also do I create it like it should be created?
Should I be initiating my UINavigationController this way or should I be creating it in IB and link it to a .h class?</p>

<p>Sorry for the long read and thank you for any help you can provide</p>

<p>Here is a pen with my code <a href=""http://codepen.io/DanielVoogsgerd/pen/Giqow"" rel=""nofollow"">Clicka the clack</a></p>

<h2>What I'm trying to accomplish</h2>

<p>I've a table with 4 cells per row. Each cell is 25% of the width of the entire table. I want to display the images in a sort of grid. Every cell has a predefined aspect ratio. To do this I use the padding-bottom trick to create an element (figure in my case) with the right height.
Inside the element I want to display the image as large as possible without stretching the image (and I want it to be centered).</p>

<h2>The problem (<a href=""http://codepen.io/DanielVoogsgerd/pen/Giqow"" rel=""nofollow"">Pen</a>)</h2>

<p>In Chrome (v. 26) the portrait images are taller than the parent's height (Even though I set <code>max-height: 100%</code>)</p>

<h2>Partial solution (<a href=""http://codepen.io/DanielVoogsgerd/pen/lwpHC"" rel=""nofollow"">Pen</a>)</h2>

<p>I solved the issue by making the image <code>position: absolute</code>, but that makes it impossible for me to center the images. If somebody knows a way to center the images while being absolutely positioned feel free to post that as an answer.</p>

<p><a href=""http://localhost:51565/RestWebService/Search.svc/GetProjects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:51565/RestWebService/Search.svc/GetProjects</a></p>

<p>Now when I use the above URL in the address bar, the browser ask me for downloading the file. I am new the REST web service &amp; also JSON. I am not aware whether in the above case I am getting the JSON response or something else ? How can I identify that the above response is the JSON response ?  </p>

This PHP script just retrieves the image source of photos in a directory of a folder to an XML file. Instead, I'd like to write an XML file that would get the image source directly from a SlideshowPro Album. The first code below lists the images from an album directly from SlideShowPro.

<p>I know memcached is a giant key value hashing function using multiple servers. What is hadoop and how is hadoop different from memcached? Is it used to store data? objects? I need to save giant in memory objects, but it seems like I need some kind of way of splitting this giant objects into ""chunks"" like people are talking about. When I look into splitting the object into bytes, it seems like Hadoop is popping up.</p>

<p>I have a giant class in memory with upwards of 100 mb in memory. I need to replicate this object, cache this object in some fashion. When I look into caching this monster object, it seems like I need to split it like how google is doing. How is google doing this. How can hadoop help me in this regard. My objects are not simple structured data. It has references up and down the classes inside, etc.</p>

<p>I report new scores using the <code>GKScore reportScoresWithCompletionHandler</code> method. My issue is that when I report a new high score for the local player, when I open up my leaderboard GUI (which forces <code>loadScoresWithCompletionHandler</code> to be called), the player score isn't updated - it's displaying the old one he just beat.</p>

<p>But if I close(not kill) the game and then reopen it and open up the GUI again, hey-presto, the new score is shown. </p>

<p>This tells me that there must be some form of internal caching going on in GameKit that gets reset when the app resumes. I do know that upon the app resuming, GC calls my authenticationHandler to let me know that it has re-authenticated the player so maybe something in that method wipes whatever internal cache is set? </p>

<p>This is the first game I've worked on where I am displaying Game Center data using a custom UI and not the native GC view controller which I've never had this problem with. Has anyone had similar experience with this and could tell me why <code>GKLeaderboard loadScoresWithCompletionHandler</code> gives me old data?</p>

(I put <code>MsgBox(""hello"")</code> inside the <code>while</code> loop and nothing happened) I've also attempeted the following, also with zero success.</p>

<pre><code>Dim i = Me.PaymentTableAdapter.GetData().HazWasteAmtColumn.ToString()

<li>Watching the <code>i</code> (any of the <code>i</code>'s referenced above) always shows Nothing, no matter what I've tried.</li>
<li><p>Here's what happens when I call <code>Public Sub ReadData(ByVal connectionString As String, ByVal queryString As String)</code> (full function in linked page) with:</p>

<p>I'm working on a C++ program and I'm trying to implement a function named <strong>copy</strong> which takes a reference to another object as an argument.  Then, it returns a deep copy of this object.</p>

<p>Some background on my project: the <strong>Scene</strong> class contains a dynamic array (called ""Images"") of pointers to either NULL or an instance of the <strong>Image</strong> class, which is not shown here - but works as it should (it inherits all of its methods from a third party library, EasyBMP)</p>

<p>The reason I'm doing this is to avoid duplicating code in two places, but it's very possible that I'm taking the wrong approach.</p>

<p>I call this function in my assignment operator:</p>

<pre><code>Scene const &amp; Scene::operator=(Scene const &amp; source)
{
    if (this != &amp;source) {
        clear();
        copy(source);
    }
    return *this;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And my copy constructor: </p>

<pre><code>Scene::Scene(Scene const &amp; source)
{
    copy(source);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, my copy() method looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Scene const &amp; Scene::copy(Scene const &amp; source)
{
    Scene res(source.Max);
    for (int i=0; i&lt;res.Max; i++)
    {
        delete res.Images[i];
        if (source.Images[i] != NULL) 
            res.Images[i] = new Image(*(source.Images[i]));
        else
            res.Images[i] = NULL;
    }   

    return res;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, it does NOT work.  One problem I can see is that I'm trying to return a variable that goes out of scope as soon as the copy function ends. I tried returning a reference before, but the compiler threw errors and this wouldn't help with the scope issue anyways.</p>

<p>But I'm not even sure that my logic is right, i.e. can you even do something like this in a constructor?  Or should I just explicitly write out the code in the copy constructor and assignment operator (without implementing the helper method <em>copy</em>)?</p>

<p>I'm very new to C++ and pointers, so any guidance would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>I have a Array like this: </p>

<pre><code>[""47'"", """", ""Messi"", ""L.""]

<p><em>(Output from .split("" ""))</em></p>

<p>Sometime its:</p>

<p>Now I need to find the time (by '), Name and Lastname but I have no idea how could I get the time (once I get the position of time I know the position of the other).
My programming skills are not the best, I mostly use code snippets I found and try to understand and learn from them.</p>

<p>For better understanding: I loop over this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr class=""score_row""&gt;
    &lt;td class=""home""&gt;47'  &lt;span class=""slball""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Messi L.&lt;/td&gt;

<p>Some information that may be relevant:</p>

<ul>
<li>It only started happening when I installed Python 2.7.  It wasn't happening with Python 2.6</li>
<li>Python2.7 is installed into my home directory (from source, since there are no python2.7 packages for CentOS)</li>
</ul>

<p>How should I approach this problem?  Where is the problem most likely to be?  Is it in the libsvm source or the Python wrapper?  I'm pretty sure it's not in my Python source, since I shouldn't be able to crash the interpreter like that.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I retrained the models on the production environment and the problem appears to have gone away.  For reference, here are the diffs between the dev and production environments for both the models I'm using.</p>

}

}

The first view displays the <code>PFUsers</code> in a <code>PFQueryTableViewController</code> with the object <code>client</code>. The user can press on an the <code>PFUser</code> then it will segue showing the detail view with a bunch of information on the <code>client</code> object. The I have a button <code>Points</code> which I'm trying to show the points that the client has made in that season, this is its own object <code>points</code>. I want to show this all in  a <code>PFQueryTableViewController</code>. So what Im stuck on is showing that <code>PFUsers</code> <code>Point</code> object in the last <code>PFQueryTableViewController</code>. Here Is how it looks in the storyboard (I know it might sound a tad confusing so I added the image)</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ndSDG.png"" alt=""""> </p>

<p>Here is how I retrieve the <code>client object</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aCoder {

    self = [super initWithCoder:aCoder];
    if (self) {
        // Custom the table

        // The className to query on

        self.pullToRefreshEnabled = NO;

        // Whether the built-in pagination is enabled
        self.paginationEnabled = NO;

        // The number of objects to show per page
        self.objectsPerPage = 50;
    }
    return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Segue to the <code>Detail View</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender {
    // ""showDetail"" is the default segue identifier in a new Master-Detail Project for Table Cell -&gt; Detail View
    if ([[segue identifier] isEqualToString:@""show""]) {

        NSIndexPath *indexPath = [self.tableView indexPathForSelectedRow];
        // Pass the PFObject at this row to the detail view
        PFObject *object = [self objectAtIndexPath:indexPath];
        [[segue destinationViewController] setDetailItem:object];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Trying to Display the <code>PFUser/Clients</code> <code>Points</code> object in the final view:</p>

<pre><code>- (PFQuery *)queryForTable {
    PFQuery *query = [PFQuery queryWithClassName:@""player""];

    // The key of the PFObject to display in the label of the default cell style
    self.textKey = @""opponent"";

    // Uncomment the following line to specify the key of a PFFile on the PFObject to display in the imageView of the default cell style
    // self.imageKey = @""image"";

    // Whether the built-in pull-to-refresh is enabled
    self.pullToRefreshEnabled = YES;

    // Whether the built-in pagination is enabled
    //self.paginationEnabled = YES;

    // The number of objects to show per page
    self.objectsPerPage = 50;

    [query includeKey:@""user""];

    PFUser *user = [self.detailItem objectForKey:@""user""];

    [query whereKey:user.username equalTo:@""username""];  //where you set the username to the specific user to get only this user's post.
    // If no objects are loaded in memory, we look to the cache first to fill the table
    // and then subsequently do a query against the network.

    if (self.objects.count == 0) {
        query.cachePolicy = kPFCachePolicyCacheThenNetwork;
    }

    [query orderByDescending:@""createdAt""];

    return query;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Thought:</strong></p>

<p>I guess I might need to take the <code>PFUser.Username</code> id from the <code>Client</code> object then send it it the <code>Points View</code> to display the <code>Points</code> object for that specific user in a <code>PFQueryTableViewController</code>. If so how would I do so? </p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>

<p>To show the PFUser of the <code>Clients Object</code> in the <code>PointsController</code> so that I can Show the <code>Points</code> object of the PFUser!</p>

The most recent questionnaire is displayed by a php-script on the page itself and for the old version I have a simple drop down menu and depending on the which option was selected I have a different questionnaire loaded below, using an AJAX script, so the questionnaire is still on the same initial page but in its own div. So I have like page in the page.</p>

<p>I'm using JQuery to drag and drop questions and change their order. Jquery works fine on the questionnaire which is loaded by the page itself, but doesn't work on the page fetched by the AJAX request. When i say it doesn't work, I mean it doesn't see the questions as drag-able.</p>

<p>And it is interesting that if I open the second page separately in the browser, it works fine. So it is something to do with a conflict between the ajax and jquery.</p>

<p>There are quite a few blogs with people with the same problem, but I didnt' manage to find a working solution.
Ideas? </p>

At first I want to make the ball follow the player's hand movement by setting ball position. After some time I need to make the ball travel using kinematics eqations. I get the player right hand transform matrix using (I do this the moment I draw the player):</p>

<pre><code>glGetFloatv(GL_MODELVIEW_MATRIX, ball-&gt;transformMatrix);

<p>and then the moment I draw the ball I try to do:</p>

<pre><code>glLoadMatrixf(ball-&gt;transformMatrix);
glTranslated(0, 0, 0);
glCallList(lists[BALL]);
</code></pre>

<p>this works perfect and ball drawn at place.</p>

<p>The problem is when I need to move the ball</p>

<pre><code>x += velocityX*dt;
y += velocityY*dt + gravity*dt*dt;
z += velocityZ*dt;

velocityY += gravity*dt;
</code></pre>

<p>the movement is relative not to player transform but the global. I tried many ways to solve this but none works.</p>

<p>So how is it possible for me to calculate properly the x, y, z of the ball so I can translate the ball after it left the player hand?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I've managed to recieve the ball coordinates by multiplying ball->transformMatrix with the vector {0, 0, 0, 1} the result storing in world vector, after that calling (the moment I draw the ball):</p>

<pre><code>glGetFloatv(GL_MODELVIEW_MATRIX, currentTransformMatrix);

<p>then inversing currentTransformMatrix and multiplying inverse with world vector. The result is the ball proper coordinates {x, y, z}.</p>

<p>Mega menus are used on so many sites and one cant find much about the design consideration of these menus as a complete example. I wish some of the .net expert gurus can do an article which can address this issue which can act as a learning curve for many.</p>

<p>But you don't need to read that post. I'll give the relevant context here.
This might seem lengthy but really isn't that complicated if you read through once. I hope it will be interesting for all. For context, </p>

<pre><code>syra(n) = { 1 if n=1; 
            n + syra(n/2) if n is even; and 
            n + syra(3n+1) if n is odd
          }
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>syralen(n) = No. of steps to calculate syra (n)
</code></pre>

<p>e.g,
<code>syralen(1)=1</code>, <code>syralen(2)=2 since we need to go two steps.</code> 
<code>syra(10) = 10 + syra(5) = 15 + syra(16) = 31 + syra(8) = 39 + syra(4) = 43 + syra(2) = 45 + syra(1) = 46</code>. So syra(10) needed 7 steps. Therefore <code>syralen(10)=7</code></p>

<p>And finally,</p>

<pre><code>lengths(n) = syralen(1)+syralen(2)+...+syralen(n)
</code></pre>

<p>The question poster there is trying to calculate <code>lengths(n)</code></p>

<p>My question is about the recursive solution the Op has posted (which is the second snippet in that question). I'll repost it here:</p>

<pre><code>public class SyraLengths{

        int total=1;
        public int syraLength(long n) {
            if (n &lt; 1)
                throw new IllegalArgumentException();
            if (n == 1) {
                int temp=total;
                total=1;
                return temp;
            }
            else if (n % 2 == 0) {
                total++;
                return syraLength(n / 2);
            }
            else {
                total++;
                return syraLength(n * 3 + 1);
            }
        }

        public int lengths(int n){
            if(n&lt;1){
                throw new IllegalArgumentException();
            }
            int total=0;
            for(int i=1;i&lt;=n;i++){
                total+=syraLength(i);
            }

            return total;
        }

        public static void main(String[] args){
            System.out.println(new SyraLengths().lengths(5000000));
        }
       }
</code></pre>

<p>Surely an unusual (and probably not recommended) way of doing it recursively, but it does calculate the right thing, I have verified that. I tried to write a more usual recursive version of the same:</p>

<pre><code>public class SyraSlow {

    public long lengths(int n) {
        long total = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; ++i) {
            total += syraLen(i);
        }
        return total;
    }

    private long syraLen(int i) {
        if (i == 1)
            return 1;
        return 1 + ((i % 2 == 0) ? syraLen(i / 2) : syraLen(i * 3 + 1));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now here's the weird part - I tried to test the performance of both the above versions like:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args){
            long t1=0,t2=0;
            int TEST_VAL=50000;

            t1 = System.currentTimeMillis();
            System.out.println(new SyraLengths().lengths(TEST_VAL));
            t2 = System.currentTimeMillis();
            System.out.println(""SyraLengths time taken: "" + (t2-t1));

            t1 = System.currentTimeMillis();
            System.out.println(new SyraSlow().lengths(TEST_VAL));
            t2 = System.currentTimeMillis();
            System.out.println(""SyraSlow time taken: "" + (t2-t1));
        }
</code></pre>

<p>For <code>TEST_VAL=50000</code>, the output is:</p>

<pre><code>5075114
SyraLengths time taken: 44
5075114
SyraSlow time taken: 31
</code></pre>

<p>As expected (I guess) the plain recursion is slightly better. But when I go one step further and use <code>TEST_VAL=500000</code>, the output is:</p>

<pre><code>62634795
SyraLengths time taken: 378
Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.StackOverflowError
    at SyraSlow.syraLen(SyraSlow.java:15)
    at SyraSlow.syraLen(SyraSlow.java:15)
    at SyraSlow.syraLen(SyraSlow.java:15)
</code></pre>

<p>Why is it? What kind of optimization is being done by Java here that the SyraLengths version doesn't hit StackOverflow (It works even at <code>TEST_VAL=5000000</code>)? <strong>I even tried using an accumulator-based recursive version just in case my JVM was doing some tail-call optimization:</strong></p>

<pre><code>private long syraLenAcc(int i, long acc) {
        if (i == 1) return acc;
    if(i%2==0) {
        return syraLenAcc(i/2,acc+1);
    }
    return syraLenAcc(i * 3 + 1, acc+1);
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>But I still got the same result (thus there is no tail-call optimization here).</strong> So then, what's happening here?</p>

<p>P.S: Please edit to a better title if you can think of any.</p>

I have two columns, which the first column was for the input title, and the second column was mostly for the input tags. I have made the inputs inside the second column to be transparent and no borders, so it will looks like we really write inside the table itself. With only one problem: I give the table cell padding to make it feel spacious and less crumply. So the input are sitting a the center of each table's cell on the second column, with a white padding space surrounds it. If I need to change the content of the input, I need to exactly click on the input, which feels weird as I set the td's cursor CSS to be cursor:text. I want that if the user click on the td (or a div, for general), the javascript or jquery will automatically select only the first <strong>text</strong> input or <strong>textarea</strong>, <strong>inside</strong> the td?</p>

<p>example code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Name&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=""text"" name=""name""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Address&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;textarea name=""address"" cols=""40"" rows=""5""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Gender&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;input type=""radio"" name=""sex"" value=""male""&gt;Male&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;input type=""radio"" name=""sex"" value=""female""&gt;Female
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Day of Birth&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=""noautoselect""&gt;
            &lt;input type=""text"" name=""day""&gt;
            &lt;input type=""text"" name=""month""&gt;
            &lt;input type=""text"" name=""year""&gt;
       &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the first and second example, I want that the user can click on the second td and have the input or textarea set on focus instead.</p>

<p>In the third example, I don't want the user to set focus or select the first option because they accidentally clicked on td area. They're not text input, so they don't need to be counted on autofocus selection. And there's no another input text at that td, so no input need to gain any focus.</p>

<p>In the fourth example, I don't want the user to always set focus or select the first input (day) if the user accidentally click on the whole td area when he wants to click on month input, for example. Therefore, I set a class for the td <code>noautoselect</code> to selectively exclude any td or tag for checked for any input inside it.</p>

<p>Everything works fine with different plugins, but I'm experiencing strange behavior when I copy and paste an existing plugin assembly dll (but change it's XML configuration).</p>

<p>The original assembly (A) and copied assembly (B) are loaded, but it seems that that the application has loaded the exact same plugin (B) twice.</p>

<p>I know this because the plugin interface has a property called 'ApplicationName' and the value is read from the XML file in the appropriate plugin. The XML file is being read for each plugin correctly, and the property values are supposed to be 'A' and 'B', respectively.</p>

       LogMessage(""Plugin Application Name: "" + pluginInfo.ApplicationName.ToString()); // Same application name (B) even though different file loaded in the loop.
</code></pre>

<p>After I load the plugins, I write the property names out to the log, and the plugin has it's property read twice.</p>

<p>Is there a low-level operation happening here that I don't understand? Perhaps a pointer to the same assembly because they're exactly the same objects?</p>

<p>Current structure goes as follow</p>

<pre><code>Data Access --&gt; Business Logic --&gt; Controller --&gt; View
</code></pre>

<p>My data access layer is composed of a <code>Zend_Db_Table</code>, <code>Zend_Db_TableRowset</code> and a <code>Zend_Db_TableRow</code> for each table.</p>

<p>My business logic is stored in the model named based on a the <code>table</code></p>

<p>Example of problematic query :</p>

<p>I want to get a specific user based on his username. To do so I have a <code>user</code> table and a <code>role</code> table (<code>role.id</code> is referred as <code>role_id</code> in the user table).</p>

<p>I don't want to have to use the <code>findDependentRowset</code> that will run additionnal queries for each row that get returned. (will get problematic in data grid that display the data as many rows can be returned).</p>

<p>The choices I have (getName() is used in this example to simplify, but it can be any processing) :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make a custom join on the role table in the user table which will return an <code>index array</code> composed of <code>associative array</code>. In that case I can't call my <code>getName()</code> function defined in my <code>Model_DbTable_User</code> to build the name (first name + middle + last name). Even if I ""cast"" my array to a <code>Zend_Db_Table_Rowset</code> (or my custom table_rowset) I can't access my custom class method since I get a generic <code>Zend_Db_Table_Row</code> object.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a custom join but build the name using <code>CONCAT()</code> in my query at runtime, I still get an array but the name is build so I don't need the <code>getName()</code> method. But if I have specific logic to apply i'm stuck.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a view joining <code>user</code> and <code>role</code> tables in my database and create a new set of <code>Zend_DbTable</code>, <code>Zend_DbTableRowset</code> and <code>Zend_DbTableRow</code>. This way I can have specific logic in my database stack.</p></li>
<li><p>An ORM (propel or doctrine (1 or 2)), I have no experience with these, I might need more informations to make the right choice.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My alternate goal is to be sure I get consistency in my data structures</p>

<p>ie:
array all the way :</p>

    array(row1), 
    array(row2)

Whenever video recording starts, the screen flickers, I get a short pause, then video capture begins. However, using the phone's camera app, there isn't a flicker/pause at all.</p>

<p>Also, my camera preview display gets resized as soon as <code>recorder.start()</code> is called. I don't see why that is. It makes the preview distorted (everything looks squished and wider).</p>

<p>My Questions: How do I prevent the flicker/pause when starting video recording? How do I prevent <code>recorder.start()</code> from resizing my preview display?</p>

<p>Whenever ""video mode"" is enabled, <code>initRecording()</code> is immediately called. Once the user presses a button, <code>startRecording()</code> is called. Finally, when the button is pressed again, <code>stopRecording()</code> is called. Less importantly, when switching back to ""picture mode"", <code>destroyRecorder()</code> is called.</p>

<p>My current problem is that once the app is closed and reopened the purchaseButton is visible again. The app recognizes the item is already purchased so if the button is clicked again it will disappear.</p>

<p>What I would like to know is how to implement something where it will verify/query the purchase when the app starts so the button will no longer appear after the purchase</p>

"6759419","1","6761265","","2011-07-20 09:02:45","","4","722","<p>I have stumbled across a rather simple OCaml problem, but I can't seem to find an elegant solution. I'm working with functors that are applied to relatively simple modules (they usually define a type and a few functions on that type) and <em>extend</em> those simple modules by adding additional more complex functions, types and modules. A simplified version would be: </p>

<pre><code>module type SIMPLE = sig
  type t
  val  to_string : t -&gt; string
  val  of_string : string -&gt; t
end

module Complex = functor (S:SIMPLE) -&gt; struct
  include S
  let write db id t = db # write id (S.to_string t)
  let read db id = db # read id |&gt; BatOption.map S.of_string
end 
</code></pre>

<p>There is no need to give the simple module a name because all its functionality is present in the extended module, and the functions in the simple module are generated by camlp4 based on the type. The idiomatic use of these functors is: </p>

<pre><code>module Int = Complex(struct
  type t = int
end)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem appears when I'm working with records: </p>

<pre><code>module Point2D = Complex(struct
  type t = { x : int ; y : int }
end)

let (Some location) = Point2D.read db ""location""
</code></pre>

<p>There seems to be no simple way of accessing the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> fields defined above from outside the <code>Point2D</code> module, such as <code>location.x</code> or <code>location.Point2D.x</code>. How can I achieve this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: as requested, here's a complete minimal example that displays the issue:</p>

<pre><code>module type TYPE = sig
  type t 
  val  default : t
end 

module Make = functor(Arg : TYPE) -&gt; struct
  include Arg
  let get = function None -&gt; default | Some x -&gt; (x : t)
end

module Made = Make(struct
  type t = {a : int}
  let default = { a = 0 } (* &lt;-- Generated by camlp4 based on type t above *)
end)

let _ = (Made.get None).a (* &lt;-- ERROR *)

<p>This works great if none of the values in a cell are <code>0</code>. The class returns me a number 0 so it's nothing to do with the class, I think it's the way I am looping through the rows and then assigning them to the array...

$rainfall = array();

<p>Which indicates the bytes read from the file weren't added to the buffer. However, Turbo Debugger shows the byte count (<code>BX</code>) and the stop condition (<code>\n</code>) are correct for a read on the first line:</p>

<p><em>Comments are slightly different, only difference in code is an unnecessary <code>PUSH/POP DX</code> which was removed, the results are the same</em></p>

<p>The debugger also shows <code>STOSB</code> incrementing <code>DI</code> at each call, as expected. I tried using <code>LEA DI, [SBUFF + 0]</code>, no difference. Not using <code>CLD</code> also made no difference. Kinda lost here.</p>

But the thing is the creation only works once, subsequent requests in the same view do not trigger the backing bean action. Upon close inspection the only difference I found out is that subsequent requests lacks the <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> attribute in POST data, wich, I think, ends up creating a whole new bean.</p>

<p>Is this the default for JSF 2.2?</p>

I've started using Q promises and now unhandled exceptions are essentially converted to rejected promises.  This is fine, except when it comes to debugging.  Consider the example:</p>

<pre><code>promise.done(do_work)
</code></pre>

<p>Any exceptions thrown in the do_work function will be caught by Q and then thrown as unhandled exceptions in the next tick.  The problem with this is that the callstack in the Chrome debugger is boring and just represents the Q flush.  It is true that the stack property of the exception is correct, but that's just a tooltip in the Chrome debugger and annoying to use.</p>

<p>I've tried things like:</p>

<pre><code>promise.done(do_work, function(e){throw e;})
</code></pre>

<p>But those exceptions are just caught by Q again; and, anyway, it doesn't matter because by the time you get to the error handler the stack is already from the next tick.  I've also tried playing with Q.onerror and others, but they have the same problem.</p>

<p>Is there a way to cause Q to truly ignore exceptions for some calls during development so the Chrome debugger can get a nice original call stack to work with before Q goes to the next process tick?</p>

<p>I am running Rails 4.2.4 with Paperclip v4.3.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p>

<p>In models/image.rb I changed:</p>

io = open(URI.parse(image_url))
self.original_filename = io.base_uri.path.split('/').last
self.image = io
self.image_remote_url = image_url
 rescue
end
end
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code> def download_remote_image
io = open(URI.parse(image_url))
self.original_filename = io.base_uri.path.split('/').last
self.image = io
self.image_remote_url = image_url

end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I removed the rescue, created a migration to add original_filename to my images table and boom, problem solved!</p>

<p><strong>Well, the problem seems to have been solved by itself. I leave my question here just in case some people face the same problem I did. Looks like it's a bug on facebook's side.
Now everything works like a charm without any change in my code</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I'm trying to perform a few things using FB api.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an album on the page i'm managing (using page access token) => <strong>it works</strong></li>
<li>Get the id of the album (ALBUM_ID)  => <strong>it works</strong></li>
<li>Uploading a file to the newly created album (ALBUM_ID) => i got the id of the uploaded photo as a response (PHOTO_ID), <strong>so I assumed that everything went well</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>But that's not the case :</p>

<ol>
<li>When I use graph api explorer and query <strong>/ALBUM_ID</strong>, my album is there. Clicking the album link works, but there are no photos in it.</li>
<li>When I use graph api explorer and query <strong>/ALBUM_ID/photos</strong>, it's completely empty</li>
<li>When I use graph api explorer and query <strong>/PHOTO_ID</strong>, I get a message telling me the photo does not exist (""Some of the aliases you requested do not exist: PHOTO_ID"").</li>
<li>When I browse my albums listing on my FB page, the album does not show up (which makes sense since there are no photos in it :( )</li>
</ol>

<p>I remember having done this numerous times in the past, and I don't remember getting this problem.</p>

<p>It seems that even if I get a PHOTO_ID after uploading a file, the photo does not add up to the album in the end.</p>

<p>Does somebody facing the same problem ? Is it on FB's side (bug) ? Or is there any workaround to make it work?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1: CODE</strong></p>

<pre><code>$facebook = new Facebook(array(
  'appId'  =&gt; 'AAAAAAAAAAA',
  'secret' =&gt; 'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB',
));

// Id of Page I'm managing
$page_id = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXX';

// Get Page Access Token

I cannot really change the general setup, since it is part of a huge framework. But I have to ""move"" a button to a more suitable location. I am close, but not happy with the solution so far. Maybe you can give me some idea in this. Here is a dramatically simplified version to demonstrate my approach:  </p>

<p>I have two container divs, top and bottom. 
The top container shows a button on the left side. That button is fixed, but can have a different width due to the translation of its label. 
The bottom container holds lots of stuff. Amongst that a second button at its top which works fine, but looks wrong. I want to optically move it into the top container, since there is a logical connection to the button in there. Sure, really placing it in there would be the correct solution, but I currently cannot do that. Instead I use a fixed position which works fine, except for the horizontal placement. I have to decide how far pushed from the left to place the button, so that it certainly does not overlap the first button in the container. I obviously have to consider all translations, the result works, but depending on the first buttons label I have an annoying horizontal gap between the two buttons. </p>

<p>I tried to use a pseudo element (::before) on the second button to help with the layout. Since when rendering the view I obviously have the translated label of the first button I can copy that into some property of the second button and use that property in my css to fill a before pseudo element of the second button which has exactly the same length as the first button. That is what is shown in the code example posted below. </p>

<p>What I completely fail to do is to place that pseudo element such that is it left in the top container (so exactly below the first button). The idea is to indirectly place the second button that way. Looks like this is not possible, obviously. But since I am a bloody beginner in markup and styling I thought it might be worth asking here...</p>

<p><em>Notes:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>that in the above code the second button is placed with <code>left: 400px;</code>. That is more or less what I want to change. But obviously <code>left: 0</code> is not correct...</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>the visibility css rule for the pseudo element is currently commented out for demonstration purpose</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>keep in mind that the second button is *not* contained inside the top container, but actually logically below the title of the bottom container. The goal is to move it optically up into the top container which already is where close to what I want. Except for the horizontal alignment...</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is taken from the fiddle I posted above. I added the red ellipse which shows what element pair I want to move and the left pointing arrow indicating where I want to move that too. I want to move it exactly that far, that the two tests ""multilingual button text"" are exactly placed on top of each other, but <em>without</em> specifying an explicit left placement obviously. That is why the pseudo element exists: as a dummy placeholder. I would then hide that pseudo element and have the second button placed exactly right of the first button, regardless of how long the translated text in there is. </p>

<p>So the final result should like like that: </p>

<pre><code>COM object that has been separated from its underlying RCW cannot be used.
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried to google it, but i could find only solutions related to destructors/releasing objects.
It is not something i want to do.</p>

<p>First, here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>String^ filename=""c:\\wb.xlsx"";
Microsoft::Office::Interop::Excel::Application^ exApp= gcnew Microsoft::Office::Interop::Excel::ApplicationClass();
exApp-&gt;Visible=false;
exApp-&gt;Workbooks-&gt;Open(filename, 2, true, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, true, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing);
Worksheet^  exWss;
for (int x = 0; x &lt;= checkedListBox1-&gt;CheckedItems-&gt;Count - 1; x++){
    for (int p=0; p&lt;checkedListBox1-&gt;Items-&gt;Count; p++){
        if (checkedListBox1-&gt;CheckedItems[x]-&gt;ToString()-&gt;Equals(checkedListBox1-&gt;Items[p]-&gt;ToString())){
            p++;
            exWss  = safe_cast&lt;Worksheet^&gt; (exApp-&gt;ActiveWorkbook-&gt;Sheets[p]);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In short: i have a checkedlistbox, this part of code is ran when the necessary stuff have been selected. In the checkedlistbox the different sheets of the Excel workbook are listed. I am trying to select the sheet from the workbook according to the selected item in the checkedlistbox.</p>

<p>At the last code line (exWss  = safe_cast (exApp->ActiveWorkbook->Sheets[p]);) I get the mentioned error message.</p>

<p>I have seen that Marshal releasing can cause such problems. In another function although i run Marshal.Releasecomobject, but it is completely separated, and i get the same error without it also.</p>

<p>Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I have two table:</p>

<pre><code>User:
 - UserId (PK)
 - Name

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>Project:
  ProjectId (PK)
  Name
  ManagerId (FK from User Table)
  TeamLeadId (FK from User Table)
  DeveloperId (FK from User Table)
</code></pre>

<p>There is a one to many relation between User.UserId to Project.ManagerId, Project.TeamLeadId , Project.DeveloperId. There could be scenarios when there is no TeamLead assigned to the Project i.e. the column Project.TeamLeadId could be null.</p>

<p>Below are the modal classes:</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
    public string Cupid { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public virtual ICollection&lt;Project&gt; ManagerProjects { get; set; }
    public virtual ICollection&lt;Project&gt; TeamLeadProjects { get; set; }
    public virtual ICollection&lt;Project&gt; DeveloperProjects { get; set; }
}

public class Project
{
    public string ProjectId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string ManagerId {get; set;}
    public string TeamLeadId {get; set;}
    public string DeveloperId {get; set;}

    public virtual User Manager { get; set; }
    public virtual User TeamLead { get; set; }
    public virtual User Developer { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>with below Fluent api configuration in the DBContext:</p>

<pre><code>this.HasRequired&lt;User&gt;(s =&gt; s.Manager)
    .WithMany(s =&gt; s.ManagerProjects )
    .HasForeignKey(s =&gt; s.ManagerId );

this.HasRequired&lt;User&gt;(s =&gt; s.TeamLead )
    .WithMany(s =&gt; s.TeamLeadProjects )
    .HasForeignKey(s =&gt; s.TeamLeadId );

this.HasRequired&lt;User&gt;(s =&gt; s.Developer)
    .WithMany(s =&gt; s.DeveloperProjects )
    .HasForeignKey(s =&gt; s.DeveloperId );
</code></pre>

<p>With above code I am able to load the Manager, TeamLead and Developer user information in the Project instance.</p>

<p>I want to make the code efficient, so that:
1) I can avoid creating the virtual mapping between Project and User for each new user type added to project. Say, in future we want to add the TesterId to the Project.

I'm using the sample files provided with that tutorial. Everything works up until I go to publish for iOS. When I click publish I get the message ""Could not access digital certificate, could not load keystore file (password may be incorrect)""</p>

<p>This makes me think I'm entering the wrong password. Is the password needed the one associated with my Apple Developer account? Because this is the one I'm entering. If it isn't, and it's another password that's just for the certificate, that's the issue.</p>

<p>I created the certificate on a Windows machine using <a href=""http://help.adobe.com/en_US/as3/iphone/WS144092a96ffef7cc-371badff126abc17b1f-8000.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> tutorial. Then converted it to a .p12 file (that Flash Pro needs) using <a href=""http://help.adobe.com/en_US/as3/iphone/WS144092a96ffef7cc-371badff126abc17b1f-7fff.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> tutorial. The only time I was promoted about a password was when I exported the .cer file to a .p12 using command prompt. I was asked to enter export password, but when I typed, it didn't enter into the command line. The export was done anyway and so I didn't think the password was necessary and the tutorial I followed didn't mention it, it was just the end of the tutorial, so I closed command prompt. </p>

<p>After some reading online though, I've read that when you create a certificate on a Mac using KeyChain, you set a password. But during my creation of the certificate I didn't set one. I've tried leaving the password field in Flash Pro blank but you can't, it gives a message saying ""Please type password""</p>

<p>So, what password is the password field under where you add your certificate asking for? The one associated with your Apple Developer account or another one?</p>

<p>This is really confusing me and I'm surprised I haven't found more with Google or found other people asking this.</p>

<p>Thank you for the help.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I didn't know when command prompt asks for a password, it doesn't show any of the typing at all, not even stars. So I just assumed it wasn't letting me type anything. Thanks Paul! :)</p>

<p>(And without using an <code>ObjectQuery</code> by the way. I known I could easily convert those examples for using other querying solution like Linq-to-Entity, but my current use case requires for now to works with E-SQL query strings.)</p>

<p>Best match for weight 1 has a rank of 249 and while weight goes down to 0.2 ranking of best match increases to 998.
From 0.2 to 0.17 ranking decreases and from 0.16 results are inverted (<em>the weight values that reproduce this behavior depend on terms and maybe on columns searched...</em>)</p>

<p>It seems there is a point where weight means the opposite, something like ""do not include this term"". 
<br />Do you have any explanation of this behavior?
<br />Why ranking increases when weight decreases?
<br />Why ranking decreases after some point until results are inverted and how can you predict this point?
<br /><br />
I use a custom ""word-breaker"", when user searches for something creating the following query:</p>

<pre><code>CONTAINSTABLE(documentParts, title, 
      'ISABOUT (
          ""wordA wordB wordC"" weight (0.8), 
          ""wordA*"" NEAR ""wordB*"" NEAR ""wordC*"" weight (0.6), 
          ""wordA*"" weight (0.1), 
          ""wordB*"" weight (0.1), 
          ""wordC*"" weight (0.1), 
       ) ')
</code></pre>

<p>Am I to expect big ranks for for 0.1 words?<br /><br />
Is the following query the same as above and am I to expect some weird behavior with the 0.1 rankings?</p>

<pre><code>CONTAINSTABLE(documentParts, title, '
      ISABOUT ( ""wordA wordB wordC"" weight (0.8) ), 
      OR ISABOUT ( ""wordA*"" NEAR ""wordB*"" NEAR ""wordC*"" weight (0.6) ), 
      OR ISABOUT ( ""wordA*"" weight (0.1) ), 
      OR ISABOUT ( ""wordB*"" weight (0.1) ), 
      OR ISABOUT ( ""wordC*"" weight (0.1) ), 
      ')

<p>I am searching in two tables, ""documents"" and ""documentParts"" and use a union all to sum ranks and get my results. According to this article there it's wrong since indexed rows are counted to compute ranking so RANK will be like adding apples and carrots...</p>

<p>My solution for now is to compute a percentage for each CONTAINSTABLE like this:</p>

<pre><code>Log(RANK) / Log(Sum(RANK) OVER( PARTITION BY 1)) AS [PERCENT]

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;tbody id=""filtered-table"" data-bind=""foreach: assets, visible: assets().length &gt; 0""&gt;
    &lt;tr &gt;
        &lt;td style=""vertical-align: middle"" data-bind=""text: id""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;img data-bind=""attr:{ src: '/manager/files/' + poster }"" height=""100px"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style=""vertical-align: middle""&gt;&lt;span dir=""auto"" data-bind=""text: name""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style=""vertical-align: middle"" data-bind=""text: category""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style=""vertical-align: middle"" data-bind=""text: type""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style=""vertical-align: middle"" data-bind=""text: popup""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Even though I didn't change anything in the view model (I just took the html elements out of the template and put them into the foreach binded element) I get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>Uncaught Error: Unable to parse binding attribute.</code><br>
  <code>Message: ReferenceError: id is not defined;</code><br>
  <code>Attribute value: text: id</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would very much appreciate it if someone could explain what I am doing wrong. TIA!</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
  $.ajax({

            var viewModel = new ViewModel(data);

            ko.applyBindings(viewModel);
        }

<p>I want to transform the dataframe by taking rows with gen values that already exist and combining them with the duplicate row, assigning the mean of their other values to the other columns. That is kind of a mouth full that is best cleared up by an example.</p>

<p>Using the previous dataframe, you can see that the last row ( row 7) has a gen value of 2. I would like that row to combine with the other row with a gen value of 3 (row 3), and then would like the column values for row 3 ( avg_ep, avgin etc)to become means of the two. For example, the avg_ep of row 3 should become (1.197 + 117.189)/2.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I have also the data split up into a bunch of dataframes without duplicate gen values, and I have been merging them to get the data frame above and am now trying to figure out how to combine them.

<p>a) I have a button on screen which when initially pressed creates a calendar Entry E on a set datetime and with an alert X minutes before the event start.</p>

<p>b) After creation of the Event the button is now shown as checked and event created and we then want to be able to press the button again and remove the Event from the users Calendar.</p>

<p>What I have tried -</p>

<p>To use the Calendar Contract Intents to allow integration with whatever calendar the user has, i.e. -</p>

<pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent (Intent.ActionInsert, ContentUris.WithAppendedId (Android.Provider.CalendarContract.Events.ContentUri, (long) GameId));
intent.SetData(Android.Provider.CalendarContract.Events.ContentUri);

// Add Event Details
intent.PutExtra(Android.Provider.CalendarContract.ExtraEventBeginTime, CurrentTimeMillis(LocalGameDateTime));
intent.PutExtra(Android.Provider.CalendarContract.ExtraEventEndTime, CurrentTimeMillis(LocalGameDateTime.AddHours(2)));
intent.PutExtra(Android.Provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns.AllDay, false);
intent.PutExtra(Android.Provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns.EventLocation, ""Stuff"");
intent.PutExtra(Android.Provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns.Description, desc);
intent.PutExtra(Android.Provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns.Title, ""Title"");

// Add Alarm reminder
intent.PutExtra (Android.Provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns.Availability, (int) Android.Provider.EventsAvailability.Busy);
intent.PutExtra (Android.Provider.CalendarContract.RemindersColumns.EventId, GameId);
intent.PutExtra (Android.Provider.CalendarContract.RemindersColumns.Minutes, AlertTimeSettingsToMinutes (settings.AlertTimeBefore));
StartActivity(intent);
</code></pre>

<p>Now this pops up a nice calendar with Google Calendar or Samsung Calendar etc with mostly the right details, but these calendars do not seem to honour the alert time (Google defaults to 10 mins, Samsung ignores what is passed), so that is a showstopper for smooth integration as the calendar alert is key.  </p>

<p>I do not then also know how to ensure my EventId is passed / stored so I can retrieve it later to check if it exists (for button state) and delete it as required.</p>

<p>To summarise, could someone please tell me if they have some Programmatic code which  -</p>

<p>Adds a Calendar entry E with Alert 
Deletes a Calendar entry E</p>

<p>Preferably without any user intervention apart from button press.</p>

<p>OR failing that, can we ensure the Intents variation is bullet proof enough to allow the use case with some user interaction as expected with intents?</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript/jQuery:</strong><br>
To create three links to display ""photo_content"" which has DOM element and a photo referenced:</p>

<pre><code>$('.photo_panels .photo_panel').each(function(index){

<p>The code is simple the program will ask for the user to input number of test cases and ask for name and score.</p>

<p>Sample input:</p>

<pre><code> 4
 Name1 100
 Name2 900
 Name3 800
 Name4 150
</code></pre>

<p>Then puts it in a .Dat file.
Then sort it from highest to lowest.
Then outputs the top 20 (hence only 20 if some of the score that is in the dat, it will be disregarded.)</p>

<p>My only problem in the code is how do I get it from the File. I know how to sort.  But how do I get it?</p>

<hr>

<p>Books (book_id, title, description, genre_id, language_id, purchase_date, chapters, words, book_review_count)</p>

<p>BookSearchData (book_id, Fulltext-searchable titles and descriptions)</p>

<p>Genres (genre_id to genre_name)</p>

<p>Language (language_id to language_name)</p>

<p>CheckoutData (book_id, last_checkout_date, checkout_user_id)</p>

<hr>

<p>A bit of table-construction rationale: I made separate Books and CheckoutData tables because in my setup, I will be making frequent requests for the CheckoutData information and won't need anything other than the data included in the CheckoutData fields.  Hopefully this was the right way to go.</p>

<p>The most frequent data request, however, will be a book data summary, which currently involves JOINs between all of the tables.  A book result includes the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Genre Name</li>
<li>Language Name</li>
<li>Purchase Date</li>
<li>Chapters</li>
<li>Words</li>
<li>Review Count</li>
<li>Checked Out?  (Which is determined by whether or not the value of checkout_user_id equals 0 in the CheckoutData table row associated with the book)</li>
</ul>

<p>My question: Do you think it would be helpful (performance-wise) if I created another table in this database that included a simple two-colum setup consisting of a book_id and a book_data_summary?</p>

<p>The book_id would be, as you'd imagine, some kind of integer.  The book_data_summary would be a field of type TEXT.</p>

<p>The problem as I see it...this introduces a lot of data redundancy.  It also means that every time that a book is checked out (Table: CheckoutData) or if a book review is added by a user (Table: Books), I'll also need to update the book_data_summary field.</p>

<p>Is this worth doing?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  I need to clarify something.  In this case, I'm doing somewhat of a high-speed library scenario (yes, that seems kind of silly, but it's somewhat of an experimental project).  The CheckoutData table is going to be receiving a lot of inserts - very frequently (we're talking...a few hundred per minute).  And Book results will be requested at around the same rate, with perhaps 10 or 20 book entries being requested each time.</p>

<p>So TONS of checkouts, as well as TONS of requests for book summaries.</p>

<p>I've put the class file in C:\ (for now at least) and I've triple checked the class name but I'm still getting the exception. Is there something I'm missing here?</p>

<p>My file structure looks like this :</p>

<pre><code>styles/

      page1.css
      page2.css
      page3.css
      ...
    sass/

      partials/
         _sectionBegin.scss
         _sectionClients.scss
         ...
</code></pre>

<p>In each pages{number}.scss file I import the scss blocks I actually need like this :</p>

<pre><code>@import ""generics/general""; // inside this file _ie.scss is imported
@import ""generics/menu"";
@import ""partials/sectionBegins"";
@import ""partials/sectionClients"";

.additionalStyles {
    background: url(/example/example-cover.jpg) no-repeat;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, here is my Gruntfile.js :</p>

<pre><code>compass: {
     dev: {
        options: {
           sassDir: ['styles/sass'],
           cssDir: ['styles/css'],

           noLineComments: true,
           environment: 'development'
        }
     },
...
grunt.registerTask('default', ['compass:dev' , 'watch']);
</code></pre>

<p>So, what I am doing here is setting Grunt to watch the sass/ repository. As soon as it detects some changes the page.css will be overwrite.</p>

<p>Well, this project structure actually works perfectly when there are only a few pages but now that I have more than 40 pages the compilation time is taking approximately 1min.
Indeed supposed that I edit a .scss file which is used by all the pages, all the pages will have to be overwritten.</p>

<p>So, what I am missing here ? How can I improve my project file structure and do you have some good examples of a gruntfile conf in a similar scenario ?</p>

The information coming in from the network contains textual items and URLs for images. I'm currently fetching the images in a blocking manner without spawning a new thread to fetch the images. This works ok but I realized that I could make things a lot snappier by spawning another thread to fetch the images. I settled on a thread pool with 2 worker threads for handling this task but now I'm having intermittent issues with the app crashing. It seems to happen randomly and I don't know what exactly is going wrong. So here's how I currently do things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>User taps search and a new AsyncTask is spawned to fetch the required information.</p></li>
<li><p>In the new AsyncTask information starts to trickle in. As soon as enough information is available for a single item we add the item to a list adapter, jump onto the main thread and call <code>notifyDataSetChanged()</code> to update the list. We also submit a task to the thread pool to fetch the image and call <code>notifyDataSetChanged()</code> as soon as the image is ready.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to update the list until there are no more items to process.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think my setup is pretty good but I would like some suggestions for improving how I do things and maybe some pointers for tracking down what's causing the crashes.</p>

  this content &lt;a id=""link"" href=""http://www.google.com/""&gt;contains&lt;/a&gt; a link

<p>Set the selection to this range:</p>

<pre><code>var s = window.getSelection();
s.removeAllRanges();
s.addRange(r);

<p>Now query the window for the current selection range and check its <code>commonAncestorContainer</code>:</p>

<p>You will find that in Firefox the result is as expected; the same element with id <code>edit</code>.</p>

<p><strong>In WebKit browsers though, the selection range ancestor container suddenly is the text node inside the anchor; <code>""contains""</code>, yet when you start typing you will find that you really are not inside the anchor. WTF!?</strong></p>

I know that I can just copy and paste a standard highcharts function a bunch of time to render many graphs to a page in different containers, but since the number of highcharts I want to display is going to depend on a value that is extracted from a database (in the example below the number of charts will be equal to @value) I ideally want to write just one highcharts function, and loop over it many times, where in each iteration I would like to set the chart options to be something different.  I've tried various permutations the following code:</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt;= &lt;% @value %&gt;; i ++){
    $(function (i) {
       graphTitleArray = &lt;% @markers.split(',') %&gt;
       graphTitle = graphTitleArray[i]
       graphData = &lt;% @array[i].to_json %&gt;
       switch(i){
          case 0:
             containerNum =  'container0'
          case 1:
             containerNum = 'container1'

          ...
       }
       $(containterNum).highcharts({
          title: {
             text: graphTitle
          }

            }]
         //more options here
       })
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>After trying this type of strategy multiple times, I can't get the graphs to render or get the function to recognize the correct value of 'i'.  Does anyone know a better way to do this?

<p>I would like to get 64x64 icons for Documents/Pictures/Music libraries. Explorer.exe is able to do it. </p>

<p>I use API function SHGetImageList and I don't have any problem to get 48x48 or 256x56 but I don't know  how to get 64x64 icons.</p>

<p>When I use SHGetImageList with SHIL_EXTRALARGE I get 48x48 and when with SHIL_JUMBO I get 256x256....</p>

<p>Is there any way how to get icons 64x64 for Documents/Pictures/Music libraries in W7 ??? </p>

I wanted from within the program to be able to re-define everything when color options are applied but I couldn't do that so I thought of the idea that the current window of program closes and the same opens but with the new color applied. So I managed to open that project again but now I don't know how to close the last one.

<p>I need a way to keep track of what record have been done and the process/status of record. </p>

<p>Here a number of Teams I could think of:</p>

<li><p>Proof Reading Team</p></li>
<li><p>Admin Team</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When staff (Data Entry Team) completed a record - he/she will then click on the Complete button. Then somehow it should asssign to 'Proof Reading Team' automatically.</p>

<p>A record need to be checked twice from a Proof Reading Team. If StaffB finish proof reading then another member from Proof Reading Team need to check it again. </p>

<p>When Proof reading is done, Admin Team will then assign ""Record Completed""</p>

<p>In a few months later record might need to be updated (spelling mistake, price change, etc) - Admin might to assign record to Data entry team. </p>

That's because I want to share a result and I want my message to not be able to get modified by the user. My current Code:</p>

<pre><code>Button googleShareBtn = (Button) findViewById(R.id.googleShareBtn);
        googleShareBtn.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener()
        {
            @Override

            {
                // Launch the Google+ share dialog with attribution to your app.
                Intent shareIntent = new PlusShare.Builder(MyActivity.this)
                        .setType(""text/plain"")
                        .setText(""Your results: ""+result)

<p>Sometimes, when 3 or more touches are active, my UIView does not receive touchesMoved: events for the moving touch. This problem is intermittent, and can always be reproduced after a few attempts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Touch the screen with 2 fingers.</li>
<li>Touch the screen with another finger, and move this finger around.</li>
<li>The moving finger always dispatches touchesBegan: and touchesEnded:, but sometimes does not dispatch any touchesMoved: events.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever the moving touch does not dispatch touchesMoved: events, I can force it to dispatch touchesMoved: if I move one of the other touches. This seems to ""force"" every touch to recheck its position, and I successfully receive a touchesMoved: event. However, this is clumsy.</p>

<p>This bug is reproducible on both the iPhone 2G and 3GS models.</p>

<p>My question is: How do I ensure that my moving touch dispatches touchesMoved: events?</p>

<p>Does anyone have any experience with this issue? I've spent several days searching for answers. I found a post describing how to sync touch events with the VBL: <a href=""http://www.71squared.com/2009/04/maingameloop-changes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.71squared.com/2009/04/maingameloop-changes/</a> . However, this has not solved the problem.</p>

<p>I really don't know how to proceed. Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>I tried using AVPlayer as it sounds more correct to use it for my purpose as it is audio only application. But soon I came across this problem : <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11676836/avaudiosessiondelegate-called-at-endinterruption-but-begininterruption-not-call/12736557#12736557"">Here</a></p>

<p>Therefore I switched to MPMoviePlayerController and this is what Im trying to do :</p>

<pre><code>    pPlayer = [[MPMoviePlayerController alloc] initWithContentURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@""http://launch.fusionradio.fm:8004""]];
    pPlayer.movieSourceType = MPMovieSourceTypeStreaming;
    pPlayer.view.hidden = YES;

    [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback error:nil];
    [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setActive:YES error:nil];

    [pPlayer prepareToPlay];
    [pPlayer play];

    pPlayer.shouldAutoplay = YES;

    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(StreamStateChanged) name:MPMoviePlayerLoadStateDidChangeNotification object:pPlayer];
</code></pre>

<p>In my StreamStateChanged method Im doing :</p>

<pre><code>NSLog(@""Trying to replay"");
[pPlayer pause];

[pPlayer play];
</code></pre>

<p>pPlayer is MPMoviePlayer. Everything is fine except when there is an interrupt Console spits out the following : </p>

<pre><code>    Took background task assertion (1) for playback stall.
    Ending background task assertion (1) for playback stall.
</code></pre>

<p>The number after assertion keeps increasing. and then it recovers from it once the internet connection is stable.</p>

<p>My question is : Is this approach correct? Am I doing something wrong along the way? And Is it ok to ignore that assert message?.</p>

<p>P.S : Please suggest if there is a better approach for developing radio streaming app using different API as opposed to MPMoviePlayerController</p>

<p>Thank you :)</p>

I'm currently building out a Django Web Application using Visual Studio 2013 on a Windows 10 machine (Running Python3.4). While starting out I was constantly dealing with the MySQL connectivity issue, for which I did a mysqlclient pip-install. I had created two projects that use MySQL as a backend and after installing the mysqlclient I was able to connect to the database through the current project I was working on. When I opened the second project and tried to connect to the database, I got the same 'No Module called MySqlDB' error.
Now, the difference between both projects was that the first one was NOT created within a Virtual Environment whereas the second was.</p>

<p>So I have come to deduce that projects created within the Python virtual environment are not able to connect to the database. Can someone here please help me in getting this problem solved. I need to know how the mysqlclient module can be loaded onto a virtual environment so that a project can use it.
Thanks</p>

<p>What I want to do is simply disable all smarty caching if a user is logged in. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$smarty-&gt;cache_lifetime = 300;
$smarty-&gt;caching = ( $user-&gt;is_logged_in ) ? false : 2;
$my_cache_id = $_GET['article_id'];

}
$smarty-&gt;display('index.tpl', $my_cache_id);

<p>Granted this would have as much effect as defining dynamic blocks, but it would be much easier and much of my traffic is not logged in. </p>

<p>I'm pretty positive this will appear on the front end as I need it to, the <strong>real question is whether or not it will cache anything when I keep disabling it.</strong> But of course I would be interested in any other potential problems doing this.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>User 1 (not logged in)- Executes page and creates cache</li>
<li>User 2 (logged in)- Executes page- caching is disabled</li>
<li>User 3 (not logged in)- Will this load from the cache?</li>

There is a button on top of the video that takes me out of the video to a website. When that happens, I pause the player with <code>player.pause()</code>. When I return from the website, I resume the player with <code>player.start()</code>. I know that the surface gets destroyed when the activity is not displayed anymore, and it gets recreated as soon as the activity is restarted. In my <code>surfaceCreated()</code>, I set the surface for the player again (since it no longer has a surface at that point), and then resume. However, the player simply restarts the video from the beginning. </p>

<p>I've tried commenting out the line that takes me to the website, just to see if pause/start works properly and resumes from last spot. It does. I'm not sure why this behaviour doesn't happen when I leave and re-enter the video activity though.</p>

<p>I also tried using the <code>player.seekTo()</code> call. There was no difference. In fact, when I disabled the button taking me to a site to just pausing the video, with the <code>seekTo()</code> call the video ALSO started from the beginning despite position being not 0.</p>

<p>The player object is the same all the way throughout.</p>

<p>Just because the surface is a new one on restart, it doesn't know or care of its contents, does it? The player should be managing that, right?</p>

<p>I'm out of ideas at this point. Can anyone please offer any tips?</p>

"2766855","1","","","2010-05-04 15:55:14","","4","713","<p>the answer to this question is probably ""not possible"", but let me ask regardless :)</p>

<p>Assuming we have a very simple JAVA class that has a primary key, for example:</p>

<pre><code>class Person {
    String ssid;
    String name;
    String address;
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I want to store people in a collection, meaning I will have to override the equals method. Not a completely trivial matter, but on a bare basis I will have something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public boolean equals (Object other) {
    if(other==this) return true;
    if(!other.getClass().equals(this.getClass()) return false;
    Person otherPerson = (Person)other;
    if(this.ssid.equals(otherPerson.getSsid()) return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Excuse any obvious blunders, just typing this out of my head. Now, let's say later on in the application I have a ssid I obtained through user input. If I want to compare my ssid to a Person, I would have to call something like:</p>

<pre><code>String mySsid = getFromSomewhere();
Person myPerson = getFromSomewhere();
if(myPerson.equals(new Person(mySsid)) doSomething();
</code></pre>

<p>This means I have to create a convenience constructor to create a Person based on ssid (if I don't already have one), and it's also quite verbose. It would be much nicer to simply call</p>

<pre><code>myPerson.equals(mySsid)
</code></pre>

<p>but if I added a string comparison to my Person equals class, that would break the symmetry property, since the String hasn't got a clue on how to compare itself to a Person.</p>

<p>So finally, the big question, is there any way to enable this sort of ""shorthand"" comparisons using the overriden equals method, and without breaking the symmetry rule? </p>

<p>Thanks for any thoughts on this!</p>

<p>EDIT: Just to clarify, this is more of an open question than a problem seeking an exact solution. The equals should cater for cases when I want to extract a Person from a collection. So it should be possible to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Person&gt; people = ...
people.get(ssid);
</code></pre>

<p>It would appear obvious and intuitive to be able to define equality on a class based on a primary key, but I haven't found a straightforward way of doing that.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I came up with an answer. User <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/1301192/dog"">dog</a> helped me to achieve this.  </p>

<pre><code>public BigInteger Pow(BigInteger value, BigInteger exponent)
{
    BigInteger originalValue = value;
    while (exponent-- &gt; 1)
        value = BigInteger.Multiply(value, originalValue);
    return value;
}

<p>This is how it looks atm:</p>

    &lt;div class=""content""&gt;
    &lt;ul class=""menu""&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>And I'd like to change it into:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""clear-block block block-menu"" id=""block-menu-menu-sub-top-nav""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""content""&gt;
    &lt;ul class=""menu""&gt;

      &lt;li class=""leaf test2""&gt;&lt;a title=""Test 2"" href=""/test2""&gt;Test 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class=""leaf test3 active-trail""&gt;&lt;a class=""active"" title=""Test 3"" href=""/test3""&gt;Test 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class=""leaf test4 last""&gt;&lt;a title=""Test 4"" href=""/test4""&gt;Test 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>This would give me more styling power.
Any idea how that works?</p>

Now, when user swipes left or right,the text gets changed depending on whether it is swiped left or right.</p>

<li>I am able to set the list view items i.e lists of planet and I've implemented the onItemSelectListener() to it. </li>
<li>I've created the 9 activities also for each planet and I am able to call the particular activity for which the item is clicked using Intent(). </li>
<li>I have declared the facts for each planet in string-array items.But don't know how to set them on Text View.</li>

<li>Like when click on Earth, I am starting another activity that is displaying the first fact from the string-array items. I want when user swipes left or right, the second fact will gets displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p>P.S.. Though I am able to change the facts from string-array items, but for that I was using next and previous buttons in which I using a counter, but I want to use the swipe.</p>

<p>I tried several tuts about swipes but did understand much. Please help and suggest.</p>

<ul>
<li>One more thing, I am having a Samsung Galaxy Y S5360, how to install plug-ins in it, so that I can test my application directly because my emulator sucks.(i've heard using Kies slows down the system-any other alternative you can offer)</li>

<ol>
<li>Use apache to be a reverse proxy </li>
<li>Strip some params from a url in case of parameter hacking.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a url, something like:</p>

<p><code>http://server.com/search?param1=xxxx&amp;param2=yyyy&amp;param3===zzzz</code></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><code>http://server.com/search?param2=xxxx&amp;param1=yyyy&amp;param3===zzzz</code></p>

<p>You get the idea, the parameters could be in any order.</p>

<p>I want my end point server to only get param2=CONST. So I was stripping the param2 and adding my own.</p>

<p>To complicate things further, this can't be in <code>.htaccess</code> but <code>httpd.conf</code> (subtle difference in rewrite rules).</p>

<p>Here is what I have currently (not matching correctly).</p>

<pre><code>Options +FollowSymLinks
ProxyPreserveHost On
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(.+&amp;)?param2=(.*)&amp;(.*)?$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^/search$ http://%{HTTP_HOST}/search?%1%2&amp;%3&amp;param2=XXXXXX [R=301,L]


ProxyPass /search http://localhost:8080/search
ProxyPassReverse /search http://localhost:8080/search
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<hr>

<p>I got it working with the following:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !site=MY_CONST
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} (.*)(^site=[a-zA-Z0-9]+&amp;?|^&amp;site=[a-zA-Z0-9]+&amp;|&amp;site=[a-zA-Z0-9]+)(&amp;?.*) [NC]
RewriteRule ^/search$ http://%{HTTP_HOST}/search?%1%3&amp;site=MY_CONST [L,R=301,NS]
</code></pre>

<p>The first condition gets you out of the infinite recursion of rewriting a rule to the same resource (so it can be proxied).</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<p>I'm using a checkbox on a website to display the navigation menu. This checkbox is present on each page of the website (same id). The aim of saving the checkbox state is to have the navigation menu already ""open"" when a new page is navigated to. Currently the menu ""jumps"" closed upon page changes and defeats the purpose of the CSS transition effect.</p>

<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

    checkbox.addEventListener(""onChange"",OnChange,false);
}
function save(){
    var nav-btn=document.getElementById(""nav-btn"").value;
    sessionStorage.setItem(nav-btn);
}
window.addEventListener(""load"",checkFunction,false);
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>THE PROBLEM:
I am using Helvetica Neue font (CSS setup from <a href=""http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Bootstrap</a>) and I use <code>font-stretch:condensed;</code> property on some of my CSS rules. Unfortunately I have soon figured out that this property is not supported in Webkit and some other browser, and I began searching for a fallback rule. </p>

<p>One solution found <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5612506/how-can-i-use-helvetica-neue-condensed-bold-in-css"">here</a> for webkit browser is to use post script font name <code>font-family: ""HelveticaNeue-CondensedBold"",""Helvetica Neue"",Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;</code>. But it is really only Mac solution. Windows browsers will not have this font and will fallback to non stretched font.</p>

<p>So the only real solution for using condensed font is to import a font from a site like myfonts.com, google webfonts etc... Since I am looking for a FREE solution I found some FREE fonts that come close to Helvetica Neue Bold Condensed. I am now wondering is there a way to specify a CSS rule only target the browsers that do not support <code>font-stretch</code> property?</p>

<pre><code>eval(function (_0xc23ex1,_0xc23ex2,_0xc23ex3,_0xc23ex4,_0xc23ex5,_0xc23ex6){_0xc23ex5=function (_0xc23ex3){return (_0xc23ex3&lt;_0xc23ex2?_0x3da8[4]:_0xc23ex5(parseInt(_0xc23ex3/_0xc23ex2)))+((_0xc23ex3=_0xc23ex3%_0xc23ex2)&gt;35?String[_0x3da8[5]](_0xc23ex3+29):_0xc23ex3.toString(36));} ;if(!_0x3da8[4][_0x3da8[6]](/^/,String)){while(_0xc23ex3--){_0xc23ex6[_0xc23ex5(_0xc23ex3)]=_0xc23ex4[_0xc23ex3]||_0xc23ex5(_0xc23ex3);} ;_0xc23ex4=[function (_0xc23ex5){return _0xc23ex6[_0xc23ex5];} ];_0xc23ex5=function (){return _0x3da8[7];} ;_0xc23ex3=1;} ;while(_0xc23ex3--){if(_0xc23ex4[_0xc23ex3]){_0xc23ex1=_0xc23ex1[_0x3da8[6]]( new RegExp(_0x3da8[8]+_0xc23ex5(_0xc23ex3)+_0x3da8[8],_0x3da8[9]),_0xc23ex4[_0xc23ex3]);} ;} ;return _0xc23ex1;} (_0x3da8[0],62,668,_0x3da8[3][_0x3da8[2]](_0x3da8[1]),0,{}));
</code></pre>

<p>Also on the other hand, before this eval function there are few variable assignments like below(just a snippet of what i have).</p>

<pre><code>var _0x3da8=[""\x62\x3D\x5B\x27\x33\x44\x27\x2C\x27\x34\x58\x2D\x34""]
</code></pre>

<p>and i decoded them using <a href=""http://www.ddecode.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ddecode</a> which decoded to this below code but i still cant make any sense of it. What else should i be doing? What am i missing?</p>

<pre><code>var

<p>I have a C# .Net desktop application (Windows Forms but it could just as easily be WPF I would think) that is a sales order entry and management system. The problem I'm running into is that one of the most important lists of data that I need to use in the application is rather big (about 15k records, and growing) and is contantly changing and I'd like to keep the list in memory in-sync with the database, while not polling the database every 2 seconds or whatever. The application is also not single-instance so all these lists the application needs are brought into memory from the database and persisted once per instance.</p>

<p>Ok, now that you can see the dilema, let's see if we can come up with a solution.</p>

<p>My thoughts:</p>

<p>If we are able to use .NET 4.0 (which I can) I think the answer to the keeping only one set of data in memory is the use of memory mapped files.  While it seems at face value a homerun, it is much more complex to manage and might be overkill. Thoughts?</p>

<p>For keeping the data loads from the database to a minimum I was thinking of something like persisting the various lists to XML text files on the user's PC in some special folder, and then one final XML file for keeping track of the XML files and their dates. On application startup a single call to the DB is executed getting the list of tables/lists and the ""last updated date"" for each. For each XML file that has the same last updated date, I can load from the XML file rather then query the database.  As for lists that are out of date I could query for the changes since the date I have and then load the XML file and then commit the changes. This way, more then likely the only changes I'll have to wait on are the changes from the more frequently updated lists, not all the tables/lists. Ok, I'll admit I'm not the best at explaining things but I think you should be able to visualize it.</p>

<p>As for the keeping things up to date in real time I was thinking about having insert and update triggers (no deletes will occur) that call SPs that then, and this is where I'm a bit fuzzy, somehow pass the inserted/updated info to a WCF service which the applications have subscribed to and the updates are pushed to the clients though WCF callbacks. Now I think this should all work but, for example wouldn't this cause 3 instances of the app be tring to update the same change in memory at the same time? Is the WCF service able to send the updates to only one instance per client PC; can it differenciate?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any and all thoughts, opinions, and input on this.  I will reserve ""awarding"" an answer for at least 48 hours as I would like to give everyone a chance to throw their 2 cents in and make this thread a little more useful for the future...</p>

  <p>program too bit to fit in memory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose the problem is that the file doesn't have the layout of a Windows executable.</p>

<p>Searching around I found that <code>zip</code> has an option <code>-A</code> that can be used to fix this problem. Is there a way to to that with <code>rar</code>?</p>

<p>I have a CSV file that I am trying to read using Python, and looking to come up with charts. The problem I am facing is renaming the X-Axis labels. </p>

<p>Essentially, the chart is trying to plot a count of different types of Audit Violations, but has really long descriptions of the said violations. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not approved by regional committee.......another 300 words - 17</li>
<li>No contract with vendor.......another 300 words - 14</li>
<li>Vendor Registration not on record.......another 300 words - 9</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of having these verbose reasons though, I would like to rename the X-Axis labels to just numbers or alphabets so that the graph reads somewhat like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>A - 17</li>
<li>B - 14</li>
<li>C - 9</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the code I have used, and except for the label names, I am happy with the result.</p>

<pre><code>%matplotlib inline
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np 
import pylab as pl
pd.set_option('display.mpl_style', 'default') 
pd.set_option('display.width', 5000) 
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 60)
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (15, 5)
fixed_data = pd.read_csv('audit-rep.csv',sep=',',encoding='latin1',index_col='Index', parse_dates=['Report Date'],dayfirst=False)

viol_counts = data['Audit Flag'].value_counts()
viol_counts[:10]
viol_counts[:10].plot(kind='bar')
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried to rename the x-axis labels using the code below.</p>

<pre><code> viol_counts.set_ylabel('No. of Violations')
 viol_counts.set_title('Audit Results')
 viol_counts.set_xticks(ind+width)
 viol_counts.set_xticklabels( ('A', 'B','C') )
</code></pre>

<p>This is the error I get when using the above code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'set_ylabel'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have come across a few other posts related to this issue, but not seen one that specifically addresses the renaming of individual labels.
This isn't utterly important though, and I'm just trying to learn using python, and the actual work has been done in excel.</p>

<li>Extending <code>AbsListView</code> and implementing it myself</li>
<li>Extending <code>TableLayout</code> and giving it fields to pass in an adapter</li>
</ul>

<p>Both seem cumbersome. I was wondering if people could see the light at the end of the tunnel, or know of any 3rd party libraries that already have what I'm seeking.</p>

<p>I was hoping to do this with <code>takeRow()</code>. <a href=""http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/qstandarditemmodel.html#takeRow"" rel=""nofollow"">The documentation</a> for this method says:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>list-of-QStandardItem QStandardItemModel.takeRow (self, int row)

The list-of-QStandardItem result
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Removes the given row without deleting the row items, and returns a
  list of pointers to the removed items. The model releases ownership of
  the items. For items in the row that have not been set, the
  corresponding pointers in the list will be 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It takes no parent parameter, which would be needed to specify a row location in a tree, and seems to only take away top-level rows. Is there a way to use <code>takeRow()</code> to take a child/grandchild of a top-level row? For instance, can it be used to take row 02 below?</p>

<pre><code>|--row 0
|  |--row 00
|  |--row 01

|--row 1

"24508571","1","","","2014-07-01 10:57:50","","1","54","<p>I have a data translation problem, and would like guidance on how I can crack it:</p>

<p>I have an inbound list of items that represent train cars assigned to segments along a journey. Each item has an index, a car reference, an origin and a destination.
E.g.</p>

<pre><code>Index Car Origin Destination
1     C1  L1     L2
2     C2  L1     L2
3     C3  L1     L2
4     C1  L2     L3
5     C2  L2     L3
6     C4  L2     L3
</code></pre>

<p>The example above show four cars (C1, C2, C3, C4). Cars C1-C2 travels from L1 to L3. C3 travels from L1 to L2. C4 travels from L2 to L3. The index maintains the order of the cars within each 'leg', but it is relative: For the second leg (L2-L3), the first index in use is 4.</p>

<p>I need to translate this into a different model that provides a distinct list of cars, while maintaining the order of the cars within the train.
E.g.</p>

<pre><code>Index Car Origin Destination
1     C1  L1     L3
2     C2  L1     L3
3     C3  L1     L2
4     C4  L2     L3
</code></pre>

<p>The second model doesn't allow for a complete re-ordering of the train cars mid journey. I.e. I can't allow cars A, B, C, D to change order to A, C, B, D. I would have to apply some heuristic to obtain the resulting car order, and it would not reflect reality. I'm happy to accept this drawback.</p>

<p>Also, although the target model index specifies car order within the train, it doesn't matter whether I index from the front or the back of the train. It would be nice to use lower indeces for car assignments earlier in the Journey.</p>

<p>So, for the solution: I think I need to employ graphs to make this translation but I'm unsure where to start. I think I should be modeling a car as a vertex, and a coupling of a two cars in the same leg as an edge. But I'm not sure where I go from there.</p>

<p>I'd be very grateful for any pointers on how to approach the problem: Modelling tips, merging algorithms...</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
One more complication: On some legs the order of cars in a train may completely reverse. This is used to indicate the train changed direction. I don't need to capture that reversal, but I do need to retain the inter-connected order of the cars.</p>

I am succeeding in loading them appropriately, however, when they are all loaded, any click on the site becomes delayed for at least 2 seconds. </p>

<p>When the svg.load function is removed, the website is very fast.</p>

<p>This is the jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>function initFloorPlans(){
    $('.list-item', '#tab1').each(function(){
            var zoneID = $(this).attr('data-value');

            $(this).find('.svg-load').svg();
            svg = $(this).find('.svg-load').svg('get');
            var path = ""svg/thumbs/""+zoneID+"".svg"";

             svg.load(path,{
                addTo: false,
                changeSize: true
            }); 
    });

}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is an HTML sample:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""tab1""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""list-item"" data-value=""zone1-1""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""svg-load""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""list-item"" data-value=""zone1-2""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""svg-load""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""list-item"" data-value=""zone1-3""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""svg-load""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""list-item"" data-value=""zone1-4""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""svg-load""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""list-item"" data-value=""zone1-5""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""svg-load""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""list-item"" data-value=""zone1-6""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""svg-load""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure if the above is enough information for an informed answer, but if you see anything suspicious, or if you can recommend an area where I can begin to check my code, that would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>The filenames go (zone1-1.svg), (zone1-2.svg) etc.</p>

<p>specific question: If there are some lingering events going on, is there a particular success function that might clear things up?</p>

I want PublicWeb to be my default one. that means it should be accessed like www.mysitename.com/mycontroller/myaction( no area name inbetween) and other two to be accessed with the area name (www.mysitename.com/crm/mycontroller/myaction). What routing/ Area configuration i should have ? I tried  <code>AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();</code> and it works only for my default one (web). When i access the other 2, it threw 404 error.</p>

<p>I tried to register indidually like the below one</p>

<pre><code>        var area2reg = new crmAreaRegistration();
        var area2context = new AreaRegistrationContext(area2reg.AreaName, RouteTable.Routes);
        area2reg.RegisterArea(area2context);

        var area1reg = new webAreaRegistration();
        var area1context = new AreaRegistrationContext(area1reg.AreaName, RouteTable.Routes);
        area1reg.RegisterArea(area1context);
</code></pre>

<p>Then my publicweb works. But when i access my forum it threw this error,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Multiple types were found that match the controller named 'home'. This can happen if the route that services this request ('crm/{controller}/{action}/{id}') does not specify namespaces to search for a controller that matches the request. If this is the case, register this route by calling an overload of the 'MapRoute' method that takes a 'namespaces' parameter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My RegisterArea function for <code>web</code> is this</p>

<pre><code>    public override void RegisterArea(AreaRegistrationContext context)
    {
        context.MapRoute(
            ""web_default"",
            ""{controller}/{action}/{id}"",
            new { controller = ""Home"", action = ""Index"", id = UrlParameter.Optional }

        );
    }
</code></pre>

<p>and the one for <strong><code>crm</code></strong> is this</p>

<pre><code>    public override void RegisterArea(AreaRegistrationContext context)
    {
        context.MapRoute(
            ""crm_default"",
            ""crm/{controller}/{action}/{id}"",
            new { controller = ""home"", action = ""Index"", id = UrlParameter.Optional }

<p>How would I go about modifying my code below, to use promises correctly? And maintain a flow, so I can validate <code>modules</code> based upon a previous <code>row</code> ?</p>

<pre><code>var Promise         = require('bluebird');
var db              = require('../shared/db');
var queryHelper     = require('../shared/queryHelper');
var schemas         = require('../schemas/schemas');
var _               = require('lodash');
var serverSettings  = require('../shared/coreServerSettings');

// Create new instance of mysql module
var connection      = new db();
var queryhelper     = new queryHelper();

// Promised methods
var queryAndWait = Promise.promisify(connection.query);
</code></pre>

<p>..snip..</p>

<pre><code>queryAndWait(query + '; ' + queryFoundRows, params).then(function (result) {
  var payload = [];
  var site_access = [];
  var module_access = [];

  _.each(result[0], function (row) {
    var sites = row.site_access.split(',');
    _.each(sites, function (site_id) {
      site_access.push(site_id);
    });

    row.site_access = site_access;
    site_access = [];

    queryAndWait(queryModules, [row.priv_id]).then(function (result) {
      _.each(result, function (module) {
        var modulePriv = {
          priv_name: module.priv_name,
          priv_num: module.priv_num,
          enabled: module.enabled
        };

        module_access.push(modulePriv);
      });

      //console.log(""am assigning "" + JSON.stringify(module_access));
      row.module_access = module_access;
      module_access = []
    });

    payload.push(row);
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>To clarify:</p>

<p>Sorry, modules are groups of products that users (row) have access to, which are calculated on the fly (bitwise - hence no join available and a separate query), the module query returns something like the following, which I then loop through and attach to the row prior to returning the payload: </p>

<pre><code>[{""priv_name"":""INTERACT"",""priv_num"":1,""enabled"":1},{""priv_name"":""STAFF_ADMIN"",""priv_num"":32,""enabled"":1},{""priv_name"":""INT_EDIT"",""priv_num"":64,""enabled"":0},{""priv_name"":""FAILED_LOGIN"",""priv_num"":128,""enabled"":0},{""priv_name"":""INT_TAGS"",""priv_num"":256,""enabled"":0},{""priv_name"":""NC"",""priv_num"":512,""enabled"":0},{""priv_name"":""CC_TIMETABLE_MGR"",""priv_num"":1024,""enabled"":0}]

However, when I try to use it as a WAR file on Tomcat, it throws several errors.</p>

<p>PDFBox seems to be unable to access the images in the PDF file I provide to the application. The PDF file is loaded from disk in a directory read/write accessible to the tomcat instance. The structure of the PDF seems to be detected by PDFBox. However, when I try to access images within the PDF using the code below, <code>getRGBImage()</code> returns <code>null</code>. This is only true on the server, however, as the same code successfully returns a <code>BufferedImage</code> when run as a JAR.</p>

<p>It appears that the 'for' loops written as ""x = 0"" are called upon and then, somehow, render without reading the pixel array. The same happens when ""int x = 0"" but with the opposite result. What is causing this and what is causing the code to ignore the pixel array?</p>

<p>If the asynchronous request pulls down the number 56, I would like to see the paragraph text change from 28 to 56, showing many (or most) or the intermediates while it increments. What I'm currently doing is setting another interval to constantly check the paragraph text, and the local variable. If the paragraph text is lower than the variable value, it increments it by 1. It does this every half-a-second.</p>

<p>My question is this: Is there a better way to do this without having an interval constantly running? Is this animated-incrementing something I can invoke from the response of an asynchronous request, and then have it cease once the two numbers have met in value? I should note also that there exists the possibility that the next request will take place before the two numbers have been reconciled in value.</p>

"30487001","1","","","2015-05-27 15:35:10","","1","49","<p>I'm new to knockout, and still learning how best to work with it.  I have a few input fields in an app which are tied to a bunch of calculations that update in real time.  The fields on their own work great, and all is fine... </p>

<p>EXCEPT, I need to format the input as the user enters it, for display only (the raw data must be retained for the calculations, but 3 should appear as 3% or in another field 3000000 should appear as 3,000,000 etc.).  I have this <em>somewhat</em> working, but I think there's a major flaw with my solution as the result is consistently buggy and it's possible to break the input field entirely.</p>

<p>So, an example of one of the input fields, which ties to another field to always equal 100%:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id='sm' data-bind='textInput: s_smixe' readonly='true'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is bound to:</p>

<pre><code>self.s_smixebase = ko.observable(30);
self.s_smixe = ko.pureComputed({
    read: function(){
        return this.s_smixebase();
    },
    write: function(value){
        if (parseFloat(value)&lt;100) {
            var otherValue = 100 - parseFloat(value);
            this.s_smixebase(value);
            this.s_rmixebase(otherValue);
        } else {
            value = 100;
            this.s_smixebase(value);
            this.s_rmixebase(0);
        }
    },
    owner: this
}).extend({percent:{}});
self.s_smixeraw = self.s_smixe.raw;
</code></pre>

<p>Which is then extended by:</p>

<pre><code>ko.extenders.percent = function(target) {
    var raw = ko.observable();
    var result = ko.computed({
        read: function() {
            var value = target();
            if (value.toString().indexOf('%')===-1){
                raw(parseFloat(value));
                value = value + '%';
                return value;
            } else {
                value = value.replace('%','');
                raw(parseFloat(value));
                value = value + '%';
                return value;
            }       
        },
        write: target
    }).extend({notify:'always'});
    result.raw = raw;
    return result;    
};
</code></pre>

<p>So, what happens here, is that the first character input by the user formats correctly, the second character input by the user disappears, and the third joins the first and formats correctly.  This happens the same if the field is computed or a regular observable, and the computed code is working fine without the extension applied.  So to input 77% you would have to type 7 - X - 7 (where X can be any value since it gets lost to the process somewhere).</p>

<p>It should also be noted that I am using a virtual javascript numeric keyboard in this app so I am adding values via javascript (though this has not affected any of the other functionality, so I'm not sure why it would here).</p>

<p>Can anyone offer suggestions on what I'm doing wrong?  What am I missing that is causing the input to be so buggy?  I'm really determined not to ditch this notion of real-time input formatting as it makes for much cleaner presentation, but I if I have to I'll just format on blur.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</p>

I do so by iterating over each table name and type in GetSchema.  Then, depending on the DataType and name, I select the parent Node into which I want to add a new item.  Sometimes that item does not exist in the treenode (depending on user settings certain tables may or may not have been added as nodes of the treeview), which is fine, in that case I want either:</p>

<p>A) An exception to be thrown so I KNOW that it failed to find the node as asked for.  Or B) null to be returned for the failed accessor.</p>

<p>A (highly modified) snippet of my code: </p>

<pre><code>TreeNode parent = null;
if( tableName.StartsWith(""prefix"") )
{
    parent = tablesNode.Nodes[""Node Name which might not exist""];
}

if (parent == null &amp;&amp; IgnorePrefixedTables)
{
    continue;
}
else if (parent == null)
{
    throw Exception();
}
....&lt;More Code For Filling Out that node&gt;...
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, that when I step through this code (or rather, the real code) when I reach tablesNode.Nodes[""Node Name which might not exist""] for a node name that doesn't exist I am unable to catch the exception because none is thrown.  If I step into or over that line of code the whole method returns me up to the highest level (my form immediately gets shown and the UI is partially complete).  What's up with that?</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong></p>

<p>Here's a VERY simplified version of my problem:</p>

<pre><code>namespace TestZone
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            treeView1.Nodes.Add(""Hello"", ""Hello"");
            var x = treeView1.Nodes[""Hello""];
            x.Nodes.Add(""World-PL"", ""Swiat"");
            x.Nodes.Add(""World-EN"", ""World"");
            var y = treeView1.Nodes[""World-EN""];
            MessageBox.Show(y.Text);
            y = treeView1.Nodes[""World-SP""];
            MessageBox.Show(y.Text);
            y = treeView1.Nodes[""World-PL""];
            MessageBox.Show(y.Text);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code relies on textBox1 being on Form1. (P.S. PL is Polish).  Apparently treeView1 can't find World-EN either which makes me think I'm <em>really</em> not understanding how treeView works.  The first MessageBox never gets shown and breakpoints on y = treeView1.Nodes[""World-SP""]; fail to break (since that line of code never gets called).</p>

<p>I have both the framework linked and It works just fine in another file within the same project, but I am getting the error that it cannot find the protocol declaration for ""AVAudioPlayerDelegate"", nor does it recognize the line <code>AVAudioPlayer * audioPlayer</code> because it is an <code>unknown type name</code>.  Any ideas why this isn't working despite my import statement, including the framework, and the fact that it's working fine in another file?</p>

I asked earlier about this and got some good comments and advice, but have since understood the assignment more clearly and the issue has changed a bit. So here's the assignment:</p>

<pre><code>                                        ***
</code></pre>

<p>Your task is to complete the program below by writing three methods (askInfo, copyInfo and setArray). Program should ask for integers (max 100 integers) until the users types in zero. Integers can vary from one to one hundred and they are stored in an array that has 100 elements. Numbers are asked for with the askInfo method, which receives the array with numbers as parameter. Method returns the number of integers. The number zero is not saved in the array; it is merely used to stop giving input. The given numbers are then copied to another array which size is the amount of given numbers. Copying is done with copyInfo method which receives both arrays as parameters. After this the elements of the new array are put in ascending order with setArray method and printed on screen with printArray method.</p>

<p>Program to complete: </p>

<p>import java.util.*;</p>

<p>public class RevisionExercise {</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {



    int[] tempArray = new int[100];

    System.out.println(""Type in numbers. Type zero to quit."");

    int amountOfNumbers = askInfo(tempArray);



    int[] realArray = new int[amountOfNumbers];

    copyInfo(realArray, tempArray);



    setArray(realArray);



    printArray(realArray);

}


// Your code here


public static void printArray(int[] realArray ) {

    System.out.println(""\Ordered array: "");

    for(int i = 0; i &lt; realArray .length; i++) {

        System.out.println(realArray [i]);

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Example print:</p>

<p>Type in numbers. Type zero to quit.
1. number: 3
2. number: 8
3. number: 5
4. number: 6
5. number: 9
6. number: 0</p>

<p>Ordered array: 
9
8
6
5
3</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm struggling with the askInfo method. So far I've written this but it returns only zeroes. Here's my askInfo method:</p>

<p>public static int askInfo(int[] tempArray) {   //askinfo-metodi</p>

<pre><code>    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
</code></pre>

<p>int i;</p>

<pre><code>    for (i = 0; i &lt; tempArray.length; i++) {

        System.out.print((i+1) + "". number: "");
        tempArray[i] = reader.nextInt();

    if (tempArray[i] == 0) {
    return tempArray[i];    
    }


    }

    return tempArray[i];

}   



                       ***
</code></pre>

<p>How can I make it to register the input and get the amount of numbers to be passed to the next method in the assignment as described in the assignment.</p>

<p>I have two models I'm working with, let's call them players and teams. A player can be on multiple teams and a team can have multiple players). I'm working on creating a UI element on a form that allows a user to select multiple teams (checkboxes). As the user is selecting (or deselecting) teams, I'd like to display the teams grouped by the players.</p>

<p>So for examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the selected teams have no players that intersect, each team would have its own section. </p></li>
<li><p>If the user selects two teams and they have the same players, there would be one section containing the names of the two teams and all the players.</p></li>
<li><p>If TEAM_A has players [1, 2, 4, 5] and TEAM_B has players [1, 3, 5, 6]. There would be the following sections: SECTION_X = [TEAM_A, TEAM_B, 1, 5], SECTION_Y = [TEAM_A, 2, 3], SECTION _Z = [TEAM_B, 3, 5]</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I hope that's clear. Essentially, I want to find the teams that players have in common and group by that. I was thinking maybe there is a way to do this by navigating a bipartite graph? Not exactly sure how though and I might be overthinking it. I was hoping to do this by creating some type of data structure on the server and using it on the client.

<p>Possible Route: <code>&lt;page&gt;(/&lt;subpage&gt;(/&lt;action&gt;))</code></p>

<p>The problem with above mentioned route is that it only supports a hierarchy with two levels. If the site needed to be able to handle ""sub-sub-pages"" like <code>http://example.com/company/contact/sub</code>, I would have to change the route.</p>

<p>Also, I'd like one single page controller to handle the request. It could, for example, accept <code>company/contact/sub</code> as a string parameter. I'm aware of the <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> key and I'm not planning to use it.</p>

<p>I go to certain files and make some changes; however, for some reason, PHPStorm would also automatically create other diffs that I did not make, and those diffs are simply removing and re-adding the same lines without changing them.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose I have xyz.php:</p>

<pre><code>$j = 1;
$f = 2;

<p>...then I make some little change</p>

<pre><code>ErrorDocument 404 /404.html 
</code></pre>

<p>set up in both httpd.conf and .htaccess in my webroot dir, but whenever I purposefully request a page that doesn't exist to test it, Apache returns nothing at all - not my 404 error page or the default Apache 404 page, just a blank page, with nothing in it at all. I think this is one of the ""soft 404"" problems, because the Apache logs and Chrome both say that the request for the non-existent page resulted in a 200 OK response, but I have no idea how to fix it, because I'm not getting anything from the server. The logs don't tell me anything, and my searches on Google / etc. haven't resulted in any solutions for the problem I'm facing. Could it be that because I'm using a PHP semi-redirect script to route all requests that would have gone to <code>http://localhost/*</code> to <code>http://localhost/testing/</code> that errors are being generated and then interpreted as not errors? For example, a request for <code>http://localhost/foo.html</code> will redirect to <code>http://localhost/testing/</code> (not /testing/foo.html, but this is expected behavior), but a request for <code>http://locahost/testing/foo.html</code> (which doesn't exist) will result in a empty page and a 200 OK from Apache. If I request a page that exists though I usually get what I want, but sometimes Apache will also send back nothing at all for a PHP script that exists - for example I'm playing with sNews, and a request for index.php (<code>http://localhost/testing/snews/index.php</code>) will result in a blank page, even when the page has HTML that should display even if nothing is parsed / inserted. </p>

<p>Other then this, PHP, MySQL, Perl, and almost everything else works perfectly. A normal page will load if it exists, and the only problems that exist are those explained above, and this is really annoying because it's preventing me from finishing a certain project.

This is their ""sample"" problem, with a very forgiving time limit (limit of 3 sec, their <a href=""https://uva.onlinejudge.org/data/p100.c.html"" rel=""nofollow"">sample solution</a> with no caching at all runs in 0.738 sec, my best solution so far run in 0.016 sec), so I thought however I'd experiment with the code, I should always fit in the limit. Well, I was mistaken.</p>

<p>The problem specification is simple: each line of input has two numbers <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>, and the output should print these numbers followed by the maximum length of the Collatz sequence whose beginning is in between <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> inclusive.</p>

<p>I've prepared four solutions. They are quite similar and all produce good answers.</p>

<p><a href=""http://ideone.com/CEgpur"" rel=""nofollow"">The first solution</a> caches up to <code>0x100000</code> sequence lengths in a <code>vector</code>. Length of <code>0</code> means the length for the sequence that starts at this particular number has not yet been calculated. It runs fast enough - 0.03 sec.</p>

<p><a href=""http://ideone.com/k8YvIH"" rel=""nofollow"">The second solution</a> is quite similar, only it caches every singe length in a sparse array implemented with an <code>unordered_map</code>. It runs fairly slower than the previous solution, but still fits well in the limit: 0.28 sec.</p>

<p>As an exercise, I also wrote <a href=""http://ideone.com/06etzG"" rel=""nofollow"">the third solution</a>, which based on the second one. The goal was to use the <code>max_element</code> function, which only accepts iterators. I couldn't use <code>unordered_map::iterator</code>, for incrementing such iterator is, AFAIK, linear in map size; therefore, I wrote a custom iterator, operating on an abstract ""container"" that ""holds"" the sequence length of every possible number (but in fact calculates them and caches them only as needed). In it's core, it's actually the same <code>unordered_map</code> solution - only there's an extra layer of iterators added on the top. The solution did not fit in the 3 sec. limit.</p>

<p>And now comes the thing I can't understand. While obviously the third solution is overcomplicated on purpose, I could hardly believe that an extra layer of iterators could produce such a slowdown. To check this out, I added a same iterator layer to the <code>vector</code> solution. This is <a href=""http://ideone.com/Gzu3KH"" rel=""nofollow"">my fourth solution</a>. Judging from what this iterator idea did to my <code>unordered_map</code> solution, I expected a considerable slowdown here as well; but oddly enough, this did not happen at all. This solution runs almost as fast as the plain <code>vector</code> one, in 0.035 sec.</p>

<p>How is this possible? What exactly is responsible for the slowdown in the third solution? How is it possible that overcomplicating two similar solutions in an exactly the same way slows one of them down very much, and hardly harms the other at all? Why adding the iterator layer to the <code>unordered_map</code> solution made it not fitting in time, and doing the same to the <code>vector</code> solution hardly slowed it down at all?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I found out that the problem seems to be most visible if the input contains many repetitive lines. I tested all four solutions on my machine against the input of <code>1 1000000</code>, repeated 200 times. The solution with a plain vector processed all of them in 1.531 sec. The solution with the vector and the additional iterator layer took 3.087 sec. The solution with the plain unordered map took 33.821 sec. And the solution with the unordered map and the additional iterator layer managed took more than <strong>half an hour</strong> - I halted it after 31 minutes 0.482 sec! I tested it on Linux mint 17.2 64 bit, g++ version Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04 with flags -std=c++11 -O2, processor Celeron 2955U @1.4 GHz x 2</p>

<pre><code>Player(Id,TeamId,FirstName,LastName)
Team(Id, Name, IsProfessional)
</code></pre>

<p>Player can belong only to one team. Using TPT (DB first), we have two classes mapped to those tables:</p>

<pre><code>public class Player
{
   public int Id{get;set;}
   public int TeamId{get;set;}
   public string FirstName{get; set;}
   public string LastName{get; set;}
   public Team Team{get;set;}
}

public class Team
{ 
   public int Id{get; set;}
   public string Name{get;set;}
   public bool IsProfessional{get;set;}
   public IEnumerable&lt;Player&gt; Players{get;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to achieve is property IsProfessional on Player entity:</p>

<pre><code>public class Player
    {
       public int Id{get;set;}
       public int TeamId{get;set;}
       public string FirstName{get; set;}
       public string LastName{get; set;}
       public Team Team{get;set;}
       **public bool IsProfessional{get;}** should be read-only
    }

<p>Is it possible to configure mapping that way IsProfessional property can be used in linq queries?</p>

<pre><code>var result= db.Players.Where(p=&gt;p.IsProfessional==true);
</code></pre>

<p>and to have that field populated every time Player entity is materialized?</p>

<pre><code>Player pl = db.Players.Where(p=&gt;p.FirstName=""Lionel"").FirstOrDefault();
if(pl.IsProfessional)
{
//do something...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Already tried with:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Entity Splitting</strong>. Not possible because I want to keep Team mapping and because relationship is not 1:1)</li>
<li><strong>Mapping Player entity to a db view</strong>. Didn't like it because there are other relationships Player entity has that I need. I know it is possible to create them manually, but updating edmx from database will reset ssdl.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>Based on second option in Gert Arnold answer, solution that fits my needs is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I create function <code>GetIsProfessional</code> (had to do it because computed fields normally can be made only from own table fields)</p>

<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[GetIsProfessional](@teamId as INT)
RETURNS bit

BEGIN

DECLARE @isProfi AS bit

SELECT @isProfi = IsProfessional
FROM Teams
WHERE Id = @teamId

RETURN @isProfi

END
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I created computed field on <code>Player</code> table</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE Players ADD [IsProfessional] AS dbo.GetIsProfessional(TeamId)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>As I'm using db first approach, I just update model from database and that's it, I can query on that field and it's pre populated when Player object is materialized.</p></li>

I know I can't guarantee it'll work there without finding an OS X 10.8 system (maybe in a virtual machine) and running it there, but is there any way I can check that I'm not using any 10.9-only APIs?  Or even get a list of 10.9-only APIs that my application uses?</p>

<p>My understanding is that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>""Deployment Target"" doesn't do this -- this just sets the LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX, so that if you tried to run it on an earlier version of OS X, it would refuse to even start.</p></li>
<li><p>""Base SDK"" doesn't do this -- this is the version of the API it's compiled with.  Some features added in newer versions of the SDK are available even on older versions of OS X at runtime (e.g., NSArray -firstObject).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Xcode's static analysis is pretty good at identifying the source of symbols (classes / methods) that I use, so it seems like this should be fairly easy to do, but I don't know how to do it.</p>

All the nice samples in the <a href=""https://github.com/mookid8000/Rebus"" rel=""nofollow"">Rebus ReadMe file</a> uses Windsor Castle, but I don't have that option; instead I must use Unity.</p>

<p>My first challenge was to find a suitable adapter for the Unity IoC Container, as the example states:</p>

<pre><code>var someContainerAdapter =
    new AdapterForMyFavoriteIocContainer(myFavoriteIocContainer);
</code></pre>

<p>I finally found some code <a href=""http://www.koders.com/csharp/fid6E93C0F14A07DD3014593C36991A3E76A5D3688E.aspx?s=control"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> that seems to do the job, but perhaps a better container exist, as I have to implement the <strong>IContainerAdapter</strong> interface myself (I wonder if that is needed...).</p>

<p>But I can live with that...</p>

<p>My next problem is worse and I haven't found out yet. In the Rebus Getting started-example the following is used to add a handler to  the IoC container:</p>

<pre><code>container.Register(
    Component.For&lt;IHandleMessages&lt;DateTime&gt;&gt;()
    .ImplementedBy&lt;PrintDateTime&gt;());
</code></pre>

<p>This above is Windsor Castle syntax and I don't know how the Unity syntax should be for the same action. So I need some help here. A suggestion would be if I could get a reference to a small solution that works with Unity. </p>

This is a WooCommerce theme from theme forest that has Cloud Zoom JQuery built into the single product pages. I am also using the ""WooCommerce Variation Swatches and Photos"" plugin. This creates visial swatches to replace WooCommerce drop down selector menus for product variations.</p>

<p>The swatch on the page uses js to highlight the one that has been clicked so that is can be highlighted and for when the item is added to the cart.</p>

<p>The gallery images use js to change the attachment src of the main image place for the cloud zoom.</p>

<p>My client wants the main image to also change when clicking on the swatch so that it shows an image that matches the color that was just selected.</p>

<p>I have edited the swatch plugin to offer an option to save an image url for each attribute in the product when editing the swatch settings. When this is set the swatch has the same code added to the tag that the gallery image uses. This successfully loads the chosen image int the main image place like desired. However the swatch does not get selected anymore.</p>

<p>Also the ""loading"" on the main image does not go away when loaded with the swatch. But it does go away when loaded with the gallery image.</p>

<p>It is hard to explain in words. If you visit this product page:</p>

<p><a href=""http://tummytrimmerz.com/shop/cami-with-jog-bra/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tummytrimmerz.com/shop/cami-with-jog-bra/</a></p>

<p>You will see the size swatches xs, s, m ,l ... are working as they should. And you can see the three color swatches are not working like the size ones but they are loading the main image.</p>

The user can scroll through the DataGrid using the up and down arrow keys easily, but when the user reaches the last row in the DataGrid something odd happens: Instead of keeping the focus on the last row it enters the RowDetailTemplate.
I wouldn't mind loosing the focus in the row selection, but the problem is that the first UserControl in the RowDetailTemplate is a ComboBox which then also reacts to the down arrow key by changing its selection. I have some few customers that already that complained that they changed the values in that ComboBox unintentionally, because they did not notice that the focus moved from the row into the ComboBox.</p>

<p>The only solution that I found so far is to set the IsTabStop to false, but this also means that the user cannot use the tab key anymore to reach the said ComboBox.</p>

<pre><code>NotificationCompat.Builder builder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(context);

builder.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)

notificationManager.notify(NOTIFICATION_ID, builder.build()); // ***THROWS***

Background; I am developing code in C on an ARMv7 chip. The system has an SD card with FAT16 filesystem for file access.
I am using a library for FAT16 file read and write operations to do any work with file output/input.
Currently I am declaring a struct globally before the main function;</p>

<pre><code>struct config_information
{
    char *name;

    //version
    char *fwversion;

    //IP address
    char *ip;
};

//Declare structs for config information
struct config_information config;
struct config_information loadedconfig;
</code></pre>

<p>The pointers are for string use.
I read the data into these variables using &amp;config.name for example. I have to use a function I have written to read in characters received over the serial port into another char pointer to strcat to another, but this works correctly and I have verified the details input by a user match the recorded input (there is a quick prompt screen on a terminal window to prompt for details if anyone was wondering).</p>

<p>I then implement the provided library function to save the struct to a file;</p>

<pre><code>fat16_write_file(CONF_FILE,&amp;config, READBUFSIZE);
</code></pre>

<p>Where CONF_FILE is just the file handle for the file to use, &amp;config is an output buffer and READBUFSIZE is the size of the buffer (defined as 148, big enough for my purposes but later I hope to change it to calculate the size of the struct to output, and then calculate the file size to be able to read it back in correctly). I have added the function definition provided by the library with the opening statement at the end for reference in case I haven't been clear.</p>

<p>This works perfectly, the output in the file is;
Name1.1 192.168.1.1
with alot of whitespace. Obviously I input Name as the Name, 1.1 as the firmware and the IP is self explanatory.</p>

<p>Naively I thought I could do the reverse to read it back into the loadconfig struct I declared with this;</p>

<pre><code>fat16_read_file(CONF_FILE,&amp;loadedconfig,READBUFSIZE);
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly this has no hope of working as the struct doesn't have any pre-defined sizes for it to know how much to read back in.</p>

<p>So, how can I read the data I have saved back into the same struct that it came from?
The name could be of any size, not massive but it cannot be safely predicted. The FW version will only ever be #.# and the IP is obviously within already defined limits.</p>

<p>Thanks for any hints or nudges in the right direction. Please ask if you feel you need more information to understand the scope.</p>

<p>For reference;</p>

So instead of returning values that should be returned, it returns wrong set of values, and designer tries to make methods based on these returned values.</p>

<p>Why is designer working like that and is there some default value for INT parameters, or is he ignoring default values? I have noticed similar behavior in Entity Framework too.</p>

I am working on a Windows Forms Application and have a <code>ListDialogBox</code> that doesn't seem to accept any of the methods I have tried to display a new line when I am adding display items with a <code>StringBuilder</code> </p>

<p>Code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>public string VehicleInfo()

    // StringBuilder and List of Vehicles
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    List&lt;Vehicle&gt; _vehicles = new List&lt;Vehicle&gt;(Vehicle v1, Vehicle v2, and so on...);

    foreach (Vehicle v in _vehicles)
    {
        sb.Append(v.VIN);
        sb.Append(v.Make);
        sb.Append(v.Model);
        sb.Append(v.Year);
        sb.Append(v.Color);
        sb.Append(v.License);

        // Here is what I have tried
        sb.Append(""\n"");
        sb.Append(""\\n"");
        sb.Append(""\r\n""); // Edit (I've tried this as well)
        sb.AppendLine();
        sb.AppendLine(Environment.NewLine);
    }
    return sb.ToString();
}

<p>And then I am adding display items to the list dialog box</p>

<pre><code>ListDialog ld = new ListDialog();

ld.AddDisplayItems(Owner.ToString()); // The Owner to list Vehicles for
ld.AddDisplayItems(Owner.VehicleInfo()); // The list of vehicles the owner has

ld.ShowDialog();
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I am working with vehicle and owner classes, part of a <strong>Vehicle Registration System</strong> project in my Software Architecture and Design course. The simple objective in this case is displaying the information about an <strong>Owner</strong> followed by information about each of the <strong>Vehicles</strong> he/she owns.</p>

<p>The <code>StringBuilder</code> seems to just add each string of <strong>Vehicle</strong> info onto the end of the preceding, ignoring all of my intentions to produce a new line for each one.</p>

<p>Any help and/or advice is appreciated!</p>

There will be a mobile App too, e.g. Android or iPhone. These Apps have to authenticate or login somehow, to access data and update stuff that belongs to the user. Since there is no username and password one could provide to authenticate the mobile device, I wonder how to achieve this.</p>

<p>Two ways came into my mind:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Generate some key on the server that must be entered on the device. This key will be send as auth-key when the mobile device sends or requests data and the user can be linked that way. When using this Option, the key should be transported somehow to the user, so he doesn't have to type it in. Maybe via email, SMS or by scanning a barcode.</p></li>
<li><p>The mobile App uses the Browser or shows an integrated Web-Panel that opens a special page of the Webapp. On this page, the user has to login in, and could then allow the mobile App to read and write data.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My question is: Are both ways possible and save? Which one would you prefer? What are the details to watch out for? Are there any other ways to do this? If I got it all right, it would not be possible to use OpenId on the Device, and link the mobile and the webapp that way, right?</p>

<p>Here's my repository method to filter and order items</p>

<pre><code>public IList&lt;E&gt; Get(Expression&lt;Func&lt;E, bool&gt;&gt;   filterLambda = null,
                    Expression&lt;Func&lt;E, object&gt;&gt; orderbyLambda = null,
                    int? page = null, 
                    int? pageSize = null)
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to call it using:</p>

<pre><code>var a = Repo.Get( filterLambda:  Specification.Where(   StringListOfFilters),
                  orderbyLambda: Specification.OrderBy( StringListOfOrderBy),
                  page: 1,
                  pageSize: 100 );
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas on how to convert a string list of OrderBy fields into a strongly typed lambda expression?  Examples of the strings would be:</p>

<pre><code>fieldname
fieldname descending
</code></pre>

<p>Another note:</p>

<p>I am translating the strings coming from the client, which are <code>fieldname op value</code> validating them with Regex to prevent injection.  Also, I am only referencing Dynamic Linq in the Specification object, not the repository.</p>

After playing around with querying Win32_Product to find a software version, I couldn't understand why the results were so dog-slow. As much as 15 times slower than querying Win32_service or Win32_process. So coming here to see if I'm missing something, I find that others have reported the same issue, and this <a href=""http://sdmsoftware.com/group-policy-blog/wmi/why-win32_product-is-bad-news/"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> explains why.</p>

<p>The most-often suggested alternative to finding installed software is querying a registry entry or three. That was going to be my first solution, except my company hasn't moved to configure servers to accept PSRemoting yet. Any reg queries just return Kerberos authentication errors. I can enable PSRemoting on individual servers, but my team supports 30K systems. So that solution is out.</p>

<p>Bottom line, we're upgrading Symantec Endpoint Protection from v. 11 to v. 12, and I want a simple check to find what version is installed on a server. Are there any alternatives to find the version other than Win32_Product and registry queries?</p>

Then I decided to modify the app so it runs as a standalone web app on my iPad. This was no problem as I found pretty good information on the web.</p>

<p>Because I'm using many app-internal links, I added the following JavaScript jQuery code to the app:</p>

<pre><code>if (window.navigator.standalone) {
    // running as web app

    $(function () {
        $('a').each(function () {
            if (!$(this).hasClass('external')) {
                var href = $(this).attr('href');

            }
        });
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>In case the app is run in standalone mode, this code modifies all links which do not have the CSS class <code>external</code> so they won't open in a new Safari window. This code works fine.</p>

<p>The problem is that if I open a link that <strong>is</strong> external, a new Safari window opens (as expected). But when I switch back to my app (using the four-finger-gesture), the app is frozen: No scrolling, nothing clickable, no task switching, no five-finger-gesture anymore. When I press the Home button, the iPad shows my home screen for a split second, and then instantly switches to the iPad search screen. When I turn the screen off and on again, I'm on the home screen.</p>

<p>The only gesture that works is the four-finger-gesture to bring up the task bar (is that its name?). When I terminate the app using the task bar, it is still on the screen and the iPad behaves as if I hadn't terminated the app (see last paragraph). Feels like the app crahed in some crazy way.</p>

<p>I don't know what I've done wrong. It's a pretty simple web page with very few JavaScript and an HTML structure that is not deeply nested.</p>

<p>I write code to get the current month. After getting current month, I am adding one month.</p>

<p>I want the month in string format like january, february, etc.. like this not like 1, 2... </p>

<p>This is my code:</p>

<pre><code>DateTime dt = new DateTime();
dt = DateTime.Now;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)
{
    dt= dt.AddMonths(1);
    int smnth = dt.Month;  
    int year = dt.Year;   
    Response.Write(smnth.ToString ());
}
</code></pre>

<li>Verified .NET framework is the same (v4.0) for all projects in solution</li>

<li>Verified that <strong>System.Data</strong> resides on the build server under C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework.NETFramework\v4.0</li>

I'm trying to set left/right margins like the attached picture. I succeeded to implement it by adding UITextView to UIScrollView.
However, I could achieve almost everything I want with UITextView alone. For example, with UIScrollView, when I manually change the text of UITextView, it automatically scrolls to bottom regardless of setting its .scrollEnabled to No. </p>

<p>It would be perfect if a scroll indicator of UITextView appears outside UITextView.
In the attached picture, let's say the red box represents the entire UITextView. I tried to change UITextView's scrollIndicatorInsets property, but a scroll indicator can be moved only inward to be visible.</p>

<p>Several apps such as Pages, aWriter, Plaintext achieve this feature.
Could you give any suggestion?</p>

<p>This works fine however when a new message is received, the <code>push notification</code> triggers the table refresh. Sometimes a new message will be placed in the array just before <code>deleteRowsAtIndexPaths</code> finishes executing and hence the app crashes because the number of rows in the table after the method completes does not equal the number of rows before minus the number of deleted rows. Example error message:</p>

<p>That gives a table like this:</p>

...
</code></pre>

<p>I am looking to use this query to make a ""table"" for a sub-form that will be below a graph, for reference only. The formatting of the ""table"" is of importance, as it needs both Column (Date) and Row headings. I have table in parentheis to emphasize that the table is generated in real time; in other words, not stored as an Access object.</p>

<p>The end result will be someting like this:</p>

<pre><code>Date         | 11/26/2012 | 11/27/2012 ...
# Insp       | 7          | 8

# Failed     | 2          | 4
% Acceptance | 71         | 50
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to be an optimal case, as the axis are just flipped, but for the life of me, I cannot find a solution that does not destroy the data. A Crosstab Query only gave me filtering on one or more categories against a single value. Is this something a union would be used for; or a pivot? Would a transform be needed? It seems like it should be such a simple problem. Is this something that can be done in SQL or would VBA be needed to arrange the ""table?"" Thanks for the help!</p>

The analytics company requires the final URL to be sent like this:</p>

<pre><code>https://thisurl.html?assetName="" + assetName + ""&amp;assetType="" + assetType + ""&amp;custType="" + custType);
</code></pre>

<p>To gather the assetName and assetType, I've created this function, which has already been in production and works fine for reporting the assetName and assetType.</p>

<pre><code>function tracker(assetName,assetType) {
  var fileref=document.createElement('script');
  fileref.setAttribute(""type"",""text/javascript"");
  fileref.setAttribute(""src"", ""https://thisurl.html?assetName="" + assetName + ""&amp;assetType="" + assetType + ""&amp;custType="" + custType);
  if (typeof fileref!=""undefined"") {        
    document.getElementsByTagName(""head"")[0].appendChild(fileref);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Now, we need to also track whether the client is ""new"" or ""current"", so I have this function:</p>

<pre><code>function cStatus(elem) {
    var els = [];
    while (elem) {
        els.unshift(elem);
        elem = elem.parentNode;
        if (elem.id == ""new"") {
            break;
        } else if (elem.id == ""current"") {
            break;
        }
    }
    custType = elem.id;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To clarify, the call-to-action button is included on the page twice, once in the ""new"" div and the other in the ""current"" div.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""new""&gt;
...button code...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""current""&gt;
...button code...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In order to create that URL string for reporting, my thinking is to use the ""cStatus"" function to identify the div id ('new' or 'current'), then use the cStatus function to get the info on the button click. The button has an onclick that passes the 'assetName' and 'assetType':</p>

<pre><code>onclick=""tracker('PDF','document.pdf')
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I'm having is getting all three of those variables into one function, so I can create the URL string for reporting. I've search and found solutions for functions without parameters, but cannot figure out how to pass a variable from one function with parameters ""function cStatus(elem)"" to another function with parameters ""tracker(assetName, assetType), so that it can ultimately be passed along in a URL string for reporting. </p>

<p>I'm also looking into ways to multithread the processing of the data, though this may not end up buying me anything.</p>

In Linux and Windows it's easy enough to setup a Python script so the user can double click an icon and the script will start without opening any extra windows. Is there an easy way to do this with OS-X? Would the user have to install a different Python than the one that comes with OS-X? I haven't been able to find a definitive answer. </p>

<p>I've tried to only include the basic code that is needed, (have deleted the getter methods, setter methods, default constructors compareTo etc.)</p>

<p>Here's some of the code of the classes:</p>

<p>Store</p>

<pre><code>public class Store  {

private int id;
private String name;
private String location;


private ArrayList &lt;Stock&gt; stockItems = new ArrayList&lt;Stock&gt; ();


public Store(int idIn, String nameIn, String locationIn) {
    id = idIn;
    name = nameIn;
    location = locationIn;
    stockItems = new ArrayList&lt;Stock&gt; ();
}





//to add stock items to a store?
public void addStockItem(Stock s) {
    stockItems.add(s);

}


}
</code></pre>

<p>Stock</p>

<pre><code>public class Stock {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private double price;
    private int units; 



    public Stock(int idIn, String nameIn, double priceIn, int unitsIn) {
        id = idIn;
        name = nameIn;
        price = priceIn;
        units = unitsIn;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>GUI: (just the code that's related to my question)</p>

<pre><code>    int indexStore = lst_Store.getSelectedIndex(); //store that the user selects from list
    int indexStock = lst_Stock.getSelectedIndex(); //stock item selected by user

    //get the specific stock details
    Stock s = stocks.get(indexStock);

    Store z = new Store(); //so i can call method below

    z.addStockItem(s);
</code></pre>

<p>It's the GUI code that's really messing me up, basically I want to add the stock selected to the store that was selected. When this is done, how would you go about accessing the information in the arrayList of a particular store too?</p>

My goal is to write each of these 100 parents lists into a different text file. I have been able to successfully output the text files (code is included below); however, the order is incorrect.</p>

<p>When I list the elements contained within the parent list I get the following:</p>

<p>The order listed above is correct (beginning at 001 and ending at 100).  However, when I ask R to order the list and print the first element I get the following:</p>

<pre><code>ctl_out[order(ctl_out[1]))]
  $ctl067
</code></pre>

<p>Consequently, when I open the text file that is saved with the file name ctl001.txt it has all of the information that should be in #067 rather than #001.</p>

<p>Is anyone familiar with a method to re-order or sort the list order so that <code>ctl_out[order(ctl_out[1])]</code> yields <code>$ctl001</code> instead of <code>$ctl067</code>?</p>

<p>For reference, I am developing the parent <code>ctl_out</code> list using the following code (after cleaning out my environment so that it only includes the 100 parent lists):</p>

<pre><code>ctl_out &lt;- as.list.environment(environment())
</code></pre>

<p>I am then writing out each of the 100 parent lists into individual text files using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>for(i in seq_along(ctl_out)) {
   write.table(ctl_out[i], paste0('ctl', sprintf('%03d', i), '.txt'),
               row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, sep = '\t', quote = FALSE)

<p>This is the actual minimax method (it has a bunch of commented out code that shows it should return a range of values depending on how good the board is if its not a clear cut win or loss but right now I'm just trying to have it make decisions based on a win or loss (if none of that happens in the requested depth it makes a random move)).</p>

<p>and finally this is a method that is called by the AI to get the best move from the list that minimax added the ColumnAndScores too.</p>

<pre><code>public int getBestMove()
{
    int highestScore = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
  int best = -1;

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; cas.size(); ++i) { 
      if (highestScore &lt; cas.get(i).score) {
         highestScore = cas.get(i).score;
          best = i;
      }
  }

  if (highestScore == 0)
    return 1 + ((int) (Math.random() * 7));
  else
    return best;
}
</code></pre>

<p>While I believe there are a couple of logic errors the thing I am having the most difficulty with at the moment is that when I do<code>futureGameState = new ConnectFour();
    futureGameState.setCurrentGameState(game.getCurrentGameState());</code></p>

<p>This should put it into a separate instance so that when I then make a move it should only last for that branch of the tree and not corrupt the actual game being played but that isn't the case. It is changing the actual state of the game being passed in.</p>

<p>Above is a jsfiddle of my application. I apologise that there is a lot of code in the fiddle but the code is needed to get the app working and I have really tried to cut the code down a lot.</p>

<p>But please use the jsfiddle by following the steps below:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When you open fiddle, click on the ""Open Grid"" link and select the ""True or False"" option. You will see ""True"" and ""False"" buttons appear and a text input which states 1.</p></li>
<li><p>If you click on the ""Add Question"" button, an alert appears stating you have selected less answers than the require amount. This is true as the text input states you need <code>1</code> number of answers but you havn't selected an answer. So Select either ""True"" or ""False"" then click on the ""Add Question"" button.</p></li>
<li><p>You will see that it appends a row into the table of what you have entered. Now within the row turn off the selected button so that neither ""True"" or ""False"" button is turned on. Now at bottom of application click on the ""Submit Details"" button. You realise that no alert appears stating you selected less answers.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is the problem I am having, how came when I click on the ""Submit Details"" button that no alert appears stating that you have selected less answers? I know that the submit button will display other validation messages so there is nothing wrong on how I am calling the function, it is within the validation() function where I am trying to validation number of answers selected where I am having a problem.</p>

<p>Below is the code for the validation which is at the bottom of the jsfiddle:</p>

<pre><code> function validation() {

    var marks = parseInt($(""#total-weight"").text());
    var _qid = """";
    var _msg = """";

    var maxQuestions = 5;
    var questionsAdded = $('tr.optionAndAnswer').length;

    var alertValidation = """";
    // Note, this is just so it's declared...
    $(""tr.optionAndAnswer"").each(function () {


        _qid = $(""td.qid"", this).text();
        _msg = ""You have errors on Question Number: "" + _qid + ""\n"";

        $("".numberAnswerTxtRow"", this).each(function () {


            var currenttotal = $(this).closest('.optionAndAnswer').find('.answerBtnsOn').length;

            if (currenttotal &lt; $(this).val()) {
                alertValidation += ""\n\u2022 You have selected less answers than the required amount\n"";
            }

            if (alertValidation != """") {
                return false; //Stop the each loop 
            }

        });



        if (alertValidation != """") {
            return false;
        }
    });



    if (alertValidation != """") {
        alert(_msg + alertValidation);
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

<p>The problem is :</p>

<ul>
<li>Squid and Squidguard see my user as : <code>user@domain.local</code> so <strong>the '%s' variable of squidguard is <code>'user@domain.local'</code></strong></li>
<li>Into my ldap query there is no default property who can interpret this string.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example :</p>

<pre><code>src ldap {
        ldapusersearch ldap://dc1.domain.local:3268/dc=domain,dc=local?sAMAccountName?sub?(&amp;(sAMAccountName=%s)(memberOf=CN=group,OU=Groups,DC=domain,DC=local))
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>And sAMAccountName should be only <code>'user'</code> and not <code>'user@domain.local'</code> !!!</strong></p>

<p>So I found a solution but It's not very comfortable :</p>

<p>I edit a unused attribute of the AD user and I write into it my kerberos login so my conf looks like this :</p>

<pre><code>src ldap {
        ldapusersearch ldap://dc1.domain.local:3268/dc=domain,dc=local?displayNamePrintable?sub?(&amp;(displayNamePrintable=%s)(memberOf=CN=group,OU=Groups,DC=domain,DC=local))
}
</code></pre>

<p>And it works !!!</p>

<p>Anyone an idea to bypass the need to create a custom attribute in AD who contents ?</p>

<p>I precise that <code>userPrincipalName</code> is the same as the email and can't interpret Kerberos login.</p>

<p>Thanks all !!!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The dropdown labeled ""Ciudad de salida"" refreshes another dropdown after i choose a country here, updates the list that feeds the second dropdown and it works fine. The problem is when i press the ""Guardar"" button to save the entity (vueloMB.instancia is my entity) with JPA, because it doesn't do anything. </p>

<p>So, i added the attribute immediate=""true"" to the button, it calls the ManagedBean method, but when i see the entity, only the field vueloMB.instancia.paisSalida isn't null, even if i fill all the fields. Because of that, i assumed that, because the dropdown calls an MB method because it refresh the second dropdown, it's value is refreshed on the MB. Based on that, i modified the first field like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p:inputText value=""#{vueloMB.instancia.numPasajeros}"" maxlength=""3"" &gt;
    &lt;p:ajax /&gt;
&lt;/p:inputText&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I added the ajax tag to my inputText. After doing that, i press the ""Guardar"" button and the field that i've modified (Número de pasajeros) now it carries the value on vueloMB.instancia.numPasajeros. </p>

<p>So, if i add  to all my fields, when i press the submit button it will work, it will save the entity without problems and all the fields will travel to the managed bean, but is necessary to do that with every field? There's no automatic way JSF does this? Or i have something wrong with my code?</p>

<p>However in our case, which I imagine is pretty common, the S3 bucket periodically receives new files with more recent data. We'd like to be able to load only the files that haven't already been loaded.</p>

<p>Given that there is a table stl_file_scan that logs all the files that have been loaded from S3, it would be nice to somehow exclude those that have successfully been loaded. This seems like a fairly obvious feature, but I can't find anything in the docs or online about how to do this.</p>

<p>Even the Redshift S3 loading template in AWS Data Pipeline appears to manage this scenario by loading all the data -- new and old -- to a staging table, and then comparing/upserting to the target table. This seems like an insane amount of overhead when we can tell up front from the filenames that a file has already been loaded.</p>

<p>I know we could probably move the files that have already been loaded out of the bucket, however we can't do that, this bucket is the final storage place for another process which is not our own.</p>

<p>The only alternative I can think of is to have some other process running that tracks files that have been successfully loaded to redshift, and then periodically compares that to the s3 bucket to determine the differences, and then writes the manifest file somewhere before triggering the copy process. But what a pain! We'd need a separate ec2 instance to run the process which would have it's own management and operational overhead.</p>

<p>There must be a better way!</p>

In this application I'm looping over an KML file that contains information about some restaurant and for each one of them I'm trying to build a <code>Place</code> object with the available information, compare a distance and keep the <code>Place</code> which is the closest to a given point.</p>

<p>Here is my Place model, a very simple model (Place.swift):</p>

<pre><code>import Foundation
import MapKit

class Place {

    var name:String
    var description:String? = nil
    var location:CLLocationCoordinate2D = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude:0, longitude:0)

    init(name: String, description: String?, latitude: Double, longitude: Double)
    {
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.location = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: latitude, longitude: longitude)
    }

    func getDistance(point: CLLocationCoordinate2D) -&gt; Float
    {
        return Geo.distance(point, coordTo: self.location)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and here is the part of the application that is looping over the items from the KML file.</p>

<pre><code>NSURLConnection.sendAsynchronousRequest(request, queue: NSOperationQueue.mainQueue()) {(response, data, error) in
    let xml = SWXMLHash.parse(data);

    var minDistance:Float = Float(UInt64.max)
    var closestPlace:Place? = nil
    var place:Place? = nil

    for placemark in xml[""kml""][""Document""][""Folder""][""Placemark""] {

        var coord = placemark[""Point""][""coordinates""].element?.text?.componentsSeparatedByString("","")

        // Create a place object if the place has a name
        if let placeName = placemark[""name""].element?.text {

            NSLog(""Place name defined, object created"")

            // Overwrite the place variable with a new object                
            place = Place(name: placeName, description: placemark[""description""].element?.text, latitude: (coord![1] as NSString).doubleValue, longitude: (coord![0] as NSString).doubleValue)

            var distance = place!.getDistance(self.middlePosition)

            if distance &lt; minDistance {
                minDistance = distance
                closestPlace = place
            } else {

            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I added breakpoints in this script, when the distance is calculated. The value of the <code>place</code> variable is nil and I don't understand why. If I replace this line:</p>

<pre><code>place = Place(name: placeName, description: placemark[""description""].element?.text, latitude: (coord![1] as NSString).doubleValue, longitude: (coord![0] as NSString).doubleValue)
</code></pre>

<p>by this line:</p>

<pre><code>let place = Place(name: placeName, description: placemark[""description""].element?.text, latitude: (coord![1] as NSString).doubleValue, longitude: (coord![0] as NSString).doubleValue)
</code></pre>

<p>I can see that my place object is instantiated correctly now but I can't understand why.
Also I have the exact same issue when I tried to save the closest place:</p>

<pre><code>closestPlace = place
</code></pre>

<p>In the inspector the value of <code>closestPlace</code> is nil even after being set with my place object.</p>

'observations' is where the chart data (e.g. date and value reside).  I want to be able to create a chart of a single hack that can have a variable number of serials, each of which contain the values for the chart within 'observations.</p>

<p>My hack controller's 'show' action looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>def show
  @hack = Hack.find(params[:id])
  @obj = {}
  @hack.serials.each do |s|
    @obj[:name] = s.series_name
    data = s.observations.order(""id asc"").map{|x| [x.hs_date, x.value]}.to_s.gsub('""', '')
    @obj[:data] = data
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The show.html.erb file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""container"" style=""height: 500px; min-width: 500px""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
$(function() {
  // Create the chart

    },
    series : 
      &lt;%= raw @obj.to_json %&gt;
    });
});
&lt;/script&gt;   
</code></pre>

<p>When running this code the chart displays 'invalid date'.  I know the data is correct because Highstocks correctly generates the chart when I'm using a single data series.  In that case the hack controller's show action is:</p>

<pre><code>def show
  @hack = Hack.find(params[:id])
end
</code></pre>

<p>With the show.html.erb file as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""container"" style=""height: 500px; min-width: 500px""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

$(function() {
  // Create the chart

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt;   
 &lt;/div&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>JS function to make equal heights:</p>

<pre><code>function resizeBoxes()
{

    $('div.view').each(function() 
    {

<p>And init isotope function:</p>

<p>I use fetchall() to create a list of column names in my table. However, another statement doesn't work:</p>

<p>I have a recursive relationship in <strong>Option</strong> entity (<em>childrenOptions, parentOption</em> - as lazy load), and I'm loading a plane list through HQL query like this:</p>

<pre><code>Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
session.beginTransaction();

List result = session.createQuery(""from Option as o"").list();

session.getTransaction().commit();
session.close();
return result;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to build the user's options tree manually, out of Hibernate session, because it's depend on other Role entities previously loaded.</p>

<p>So, when I try to use <strong>getChildrenOptions()</strong> property to .add sub-options, I'm getting <em>""could not initialize proxy - no Session""</em> error.</p>

<p>I have already tried <strong>session.evict()</strong> and <strong>.getHibernateLazyInitializer().getImplementation()</strong>, but </p>

<pre><code>if (option instanceof HibernateProxy)
</code></pre>

<p>is always false.</p>

<p>Is it possible to unable/remove this proxy behaviour and work with collection properties like normal POJO's?</p>

<p>It's seems like a performance issue to eager load all options, I would like to build the tree by myself.</p>

The answer was always to use texture mapping but what I really want to do is represent the star as a single vertex - you may think I'm copping out with a simplistic method but in fact, a single point source of light actually looks pretty good and realistic. But I want to process that point of light with something like a gaussian blur too give it a little more body when zooming in or for brighter stars. I was going to texture map a gaussian blur image but if I understand things correctly I would then have to draw each star with 4 vertexes. Maybe not so difficult but I don't want to go there if I can just process a single vertex. Would a vertex-shader do this? Can GLKBaseEffects get me there? Any suggestions?</p>

I'm trying to accomplish an animation of star shapes that moves along a sort of arc(trying to simulate an orbit on a 2d wise). The orbit Action is used with a Timer to animate the stars. </p>

<p>Simply put, I have drawn several stars at various positions in a jpanel. The translation of the stars y position depends on how far that star is away from the the x axis of decline which is initialized to 300(the center of the jpanel). The closer a star is to the point of decline, the less their y position is going to change. When a star reaches or passes the right side of the panel(or goes out of view), reset to the left side at its original y position(ugly, i know). I chose to do it this way since the stars are placed at random. I cant have all the stars start with the same dy, if it were so, all the stars would move along their own arc instead.</p>

<p>However, when I run this, after the third pass, the x positions of all the stars become smaller(into the negative ranges and out of view). Any suggestions for a better way to accomplish the original task are welcome. Thanks.</p>

<p>In doing my own research, I've come across the SQLBULKLOAD class.  In fact, I've found some example code online that shows (at least partially) exactly what I'm trying to do:  </p>

<pre><code>using System;

            {

        }
    }
}  
</code></pre>

<p>With the code above, I'm able to import an .XML file into a SQL Server instance.  However, my problem is generating the 'Response' .XML file to provide information about the bulk loading operation (i.e. how many records were inserted, if the insert was successful).<br>
As it stands now, I'm thinking that I may be using the wrong class for what I'm trying to accomplish.  Am I using the correct class, or should I be using a different one?<br>
If possible, could anyone point me in the direction of some more material to assist me?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Firstly, I'm using <a href=""http://www.sanwebe.com/2012/05/ajax-image-upload-with-progressbar-with-jquery-and-php"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""AJAX file upload"">this JQUERY AJAX file upload with progress bar example</a> to handle the file upload. So here you can pretty much see my coding for that mechanism. Although I added ""dataType: 'json'"" to the options to handle the response.</p>

<p>In the PHP script, I handle the file upload, clean up the file name, etc. Then I call an external cmd process. This process throws out updates such as ""Completed: 10%"", through to ""Completed: 100%"". This is the info that I wanna throw out to the browser via json. Here is my code for this:</p>

<pre><code>ob_implicit_flush(true);
ob_end_flush();

$cmd = //call exe with arguements

$descriptorspec = array(
    0 =&gt; array(""pipe"", ""r""),
    1 =&gt; array(""pipe"", ""w""),
    2 =&gt; array(""pipe"", ""w"")
);
flush();
$process = proc_open($cmd, $descriptorspec, $pipes, NULL, NULL);
if (is_resource($process)) {
    $return = array();
    while ($s = fgets($pipes[1])) {
        $return['status'] = substr($s,0,16);
        echo json_encode($return);
        //file_put_contents($file, json_encode($return));
        flush();
    }
}      
proc_close($process);
</code></pre>

<p>This throws out this json output:</p>

<pre><code>{""status"":""Completed: 10%\r\n""}
{""status"":""Completed: 13%\r\n""}
{""status"":""Completed: 16%\r\n""}
... truncated ...
{""status"":""Completed: 90%\r\n""}
{""status"":""Completed: 95%\r\n""}
{""status"":""Completed: 100%\r"",""output"":""&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\""images\/accept.png\"" width=\""16\"" height=\""16\"" alt=\""\"" valign=\""top\"" \/&gt; Successfully converted:&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;a href=\""test.zip\""&gt;test.zip&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;""}
</code></pre>

<p>So, I want to be able to output the status values every 2/3 seconds. The final output value is outputted in the JQUERY success function.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind, I'm a lightweight user of JQUERY and AJAX.</p>

<p>[EDIT] The alternate route would be for me to write the status message(s) to a unique txt file and have JQUERY poll that every few seconds.</p>

<p>I am struggling with a simple concept of populating a simple UITableView in MonoTouch.  I have seen examples of doing this with custom cells, and extensively customizing the list with varying pieces of information, but I am just looking for the bare minimum of how to achieve this simple thing.  I'm a professional .NET developer and very new to iOS, so still wrapping my head around how it works.</p>

<p>I just want the following.
Create a list of items
Assign that list of items to the UITableView to allow the user to scroll the list.  Looking for a very very simple example.</p>

<p>The biggest thing I am struggling with is creating a UITableViewDataSource object.  It's abstract so I can't create an instance of it.  I could create my own class that inherits it, but I am looking for a concrete implementation in the framework to use without having to create my own.  Am I too spoiled by .NET and have to create a new class for it, or does it exist somewhere in the Framework and I just can't find it?</p>

<p><strong>[Answer here]</strong>
I found an answer, but StackOverflow won't let me answer my own question with less than 100 reputation or unless I wait 8 hours which I am not willing to do.  Answer below:</p>

<p>I created the following class that inherits UITableViewSource.  It is a requirement to do it this way.  GetCell controls how you will render the cell on the table.</p>

<p>Create an instance of this and pass in a list of strings to populate.</p>

<p>This example came from (I modified it slightly) the book I am reading from Wrox Press - ""Professional iPhone Programming with MonoTouch and .NET C#""</p>

<pre><code>public class TableViewSource : UITableViewSource
{
    private List&lt;string&gt; rows;

    public TableViewSource (List&lt;string&gt; list) 
    { 
            rows = list; 
    }

    public override int RowsInSection (UITableView tableview, int section) 
    { 
        return rows.Count; 
    }

    public override UITableViewCell GetCell(UITableView tableView, NSIndexPath indexPath)
    {  
        UITableViewCell cell = new UITableViewCell(UITableViewCellStyle.Default,""mycell""); 
        cell.TextLabel.Text = rows[indexPath.Row];
        return cell;
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Put the following code in ViewDidLoad on your screen.</p>

<pre><code>var list = new List&lt;String&gt;()
{   
    ""San Francisco"",    
    ""Buenos Aires"", 
    ""São Paulo""
};

TableViewSource tableData = new TableViewSource(list);
this.tblTrips.Source = tableData;
</code></pre>

<p>This gives me what I am looking for without requiring a deep dive into MonoTouch.Dialog</p>

<p>That would be great, but I haven't found any way to add this new voter to the authorization process without completely redefine the AccessDecisionManager bean. This is very inconvenient because my business logic should be added transparently and does not require any specific decision manager. Instead, it should only tells his opinion (vote) and let the enclosing application apply its own authorization policy.</p>

<p>Even the spring security's suggested example (<a href=""https://spring.io/blog/2009/01/03/spring-security-customization-part-2-adjusting-secured-session-in-real-time"" rel=""nofollow"">https://spring.io/blog/2009/01/03/spring-security-customization-part-2-adjusting-secured-session-in-real-time</a>) uses this approach.</p>

<p>So, I was wondering if there is some way to add my voter to the current AccessDecisionManager without having to take care of it. Any thoughts?</p>

<a href=""http://www.float4x4.net/index.php/2011/07/hardware-instancing-for-pc-in-xna-4-with-textures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.float4x4.net/index.php/2011/07/hardware-instancing-for-pc-in-xna-4-with-textures/</a></p>

<p>I have created the needed shader (without texture atlas though, single texture only) and I am trying to use this method to draw a simple tree I generated using 3DS Max 2013 and exported via FBX format. </p>

<p>The results I'm seeing left me without clue as to what is going on.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZFEQn.jpg"" alt=""Tree without it's trunk, for some reason.""></p>

<p>Back when I was using no instancing methods, but simply calling Draw on a mesh (for every tree on a level), the whole tree was shown:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/KxJya.jpg"" alt=""Correct render, but not instanced (could be very slow on several hundred objects per level""></p>

<p>I have made absolutely sure that the Model contains <em>only one Mesh and that Mesh contains only one MeshPart</em>. </p>

<p>I am using Vertex Extraction method, by using Model's Vertex and Index Buffer ""GetData&lt;>()"" method, and correct number of vertices and indices, hence, correct number of primitives is rendered. Correct texture coordinates and Normals for lighting are also extracted, as is visible by the part of the tree that is being rendered.</p>

<p>Also the parts of the tree are also in their correct places as well. </p>

<p>They are simply missing some 1000 or so polygons for absolutely no reason what so ever. I have break-pointed at every step of vertex extraction and shader's parameter generation, and I cannot for the life of me figure out what am I doing wrong. </p>

<p>My Shader's Vertex Transformation function:</p>

<pre><code>VertexShaderOutput VertexShaderFunction2(VertexShaderInput IN, float4x4 instanceTransform : TEXCOORD1)
{
        VertexShaderOutput output;

        float4 worldPosition = mul(IN.Position, transpose(instanceTransform));
        float4 viewPosition = mul(worldPosition, View);
        output.Position = mul(viewPosition, Projection);
        output.texCoord = IN.texCoord;
        output.Normal = IN.Normal;

        return output;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Vertex bindings and index buffer generation:</p>

<pre><code>instanceBuffer = new VertexBuffer(Game1.graphics.GraphicsDevice, Core.VertexData.InstanceVertex.vertexDeclaration, counter, BufferUsage.WriteOnly);
            instanceVertices = new Core.VertexData.InstanceVertex[counter];

            for (int i = 0; i &lt; counter; i++)
            {
                instanceVertices[i] = new Core.VertexData.InstanceVertex(locations[i]);
            }

            instanceBuffer.SetData(instanceVertices);

            bufferBinding[0] = new VertexBufferBinding(vBuffer, 0, 0);
            bufferBinding[1] = new VertexBufferBinding(instanceBuffer, 0, 1);
</code></pre>

<p>Vertex extraction method used to get all vertex info (this part I'm sure works correctly as I have used it before to load test geometric shapes into levels, like boxes, spheres, etc for testing various shaders, and constructing bounding boxes around them using extracted vertex data, and it is all correct):</p>

<pre><code>public void getVertexData(ModelMeshPart part)
        {
            modelVertices = new VertexPositionNormalTexture[part.NumVertices];
            rawData = new Vector3[modelVertices.Length];
            modelIndices32 = new uint[rawData.Length];
            modelIndices16 = new ushort[rawData.Length];

            int stride = part.VertexBuffer.VertexDeclaration.VertexStride;

            VertexPositionNormalTexture[] vertexData = new VertexPositionNormalTexture[part.NumVertices];
            part.VertexBuffer.GetData(part.VertexOffset * stride, vertexData, 0, part.NumVertices, stride);

            if (part.IndexBuffer.IndexElementSize == IndexElementSize.ThirtyTwoBits)
                part.IndexBuffer.GetData&lt;uint&gt;(modelIndices32);
            if (part.IndexBuffer.IndexElementSize == IndexElementSize.SixteenBits)
                part.IndexBuffer.GetData&lt;ushort&gt;(modelIndices16);

            for (int i = 0; i &lt; modelVertices.Length; i++)
            {
                rawData[i] = vertexData[i].Position;
                modelVertices[i].Position = rawData[i];
                modelVertices[i].TextureCoordinate = vertexData[i].TextureCoordinate;
                modelVertices[i].Normal = vertexData[i].Normal;
                counter++;
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>This is the rendering code for the object batch (trees in this particular case):</p>

<pre><code>public void RenderHW()
        {
            Game1.graphics.GraphicsDevice.RasterizerState = rState;

            treeBatchShader.CurrentTechnique.Passes[0].Apply();
            Game1.graphics.GraphicsDevice.SetVertexBuffers(bufferBinding);
            Game1.graphics.GraphicsDevice.Indices = iBuffer;
            Game1.graphics.GraphicsDevice.DrawInstancedPrimitives(PrimitiveType.TriangleList, 0, 0, treeMesh.Length, 0, primitive , counter);

            Game1.graphics.GraphicsDevice.RasterizerState = rState2;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>If anybody has any idea where to even start looking for errors, just post all ideas that come to mind, as I'm completely stumped as to what's going on. </p>

<p>This even counters all my previous experience where I'd mess something up in shader code or vertex generation, you'd get some absolute mess on your screen - numerous graphical artifacts such as elongated triangles originating where mesh should be, but one tip stretching back to (0,0,0), black texture, incorrect positioning (often outside skybox or below terrain), incorrect scaling...</p>

<p>This is something different, almost as if it works - the part of the tree that is visible is correct in every single aspect (location, rotation, scale, texture, shading), except that a part is missing. What makes it weirder for me is that the part missing is seemingly logically segmented: Only tree trunk's primitives, and some leaves off the lowest branches of the tree are missing, leaving all other primitives correctly rendered with no artifacts. Basically, they're... <em>correctly missing</em>. </p>

<li>If a user is signed in (and assuming he selected remember_me), there is another Cookie for remember_user_token with the browser.</li>

<li>The above methods call <a href=""https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/v1.5/lib/devise/strategies/rememberable.rb#L19"" rel=""nofollow""><code>authenticate!</code></a>, which itself calls <a href=""https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/v1.5/lib/devise/models/rememberable.rb#L114"" rel=""nofollow""><code>serialize_from_cookie</code></a>, that uses <code>remember_token</code> to authenticate the user.</li>

<li>When is that used, and how? </li>
<li>If a user is signed in, for my rails application (or devise) to uniquely identify the user, will it ever use session_id?</li>

<p>I tried to move it in actions/clickedAction.jsx (or .js) and import it using <code>import ""actions/clickedActions.jsx""</code> but I keep getting <code>Illegal import declaration</code>. How can I achieve this?</p>

<p>I am not using RequireJS and would like to avoid it if possible. One alternative solution I have found is to include this in the HTML file,</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='xxxxx/actions/clickedAction.js"")'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>, but this is not ideal and would like to find another way. Thanks for your attention and help.</p>

<h2>In Short</h2>

<p>What is the difference between <code>clang -O1</code> and <code>opt -O1</code>?
I observed that these two commands behave in a significantly different way.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>I would like to test LLVM optimization passes. More specifically, I would like to pick a subset of <code>-O1</code> passes so that 1) the subset's performance is as good as the whole <code>-O1</code>, and 2) the selected passes are easy to reason about their correctness.</p>

<p>To test the performance of subset, I wrote a shell script like:</p>

<pre><code>clang -o a.bc -emit-llvm -c a.c
opt (..., optmizations like -adce, ...) a.bc &gt;a.opt.bc
clang -o a a.opt.bc
</code></pre>

<p>After a lot of tries, I figured out that:</p>

<pre><code>clang -o a.bc -emit-llvm -c a.c
opt -O1 a.bc &gt;a.opt.bc
clang -o a a.opt.bc
</code></pre>

<p>and
    clang -O1 -o a a.c</p>

<p>emit significantly different binary. The latter is much more efficient, for e.g., for an example program the former takes 49 secs to run, while the latter takes 29 secs.</p>

<h2>Tried Approaches</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I searched what does it mean for <code>clang -O1</code>, and found some references like <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15548023/clang-optimization-levels"">Clang optimization levels</a>, but the article is really about <code>opt</code>, not <code>clang</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried to find official documentation for <code>clang</code>, but it was unfruitful.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried to understand <code>clang</code> source code, but I could not...</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Found Facts</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I tried with</p>

<p>clang -o a.bc -emit-llvm -c a.c
opt -mem2reg -O1 a.bc >a.opt.bc
clang -o a a.opt.bc</p></li>
</ul>

<p>since a reference(<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15548023/clang-optimization-levels"">Clang optimization levels</a>) said that <code>opt -O1</code> does not contain <code>mem2reg</code> pass. It helped to close some gap, but not completely. (49 secs -> 40 secs) That means, I guess, <code>clang -O1</code> performs some preliminary optimizations, such as <code>mem2reg</code>, before <code>-O1</code> does something else.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I tried with</p>

<p>clang -o a.bc -emit-llvm -c a.c
opt -mem2reg -O1 a.bc >a.opt.bc
clang -O1 -o a a.opt.bc</p></li>
</ul>

<p>since I expect some target-dependent optimizations after LLVM IR passes. Actually it worked. (40 secs -> 26 secs, even faster than just <code>clang -O1</code>'s 29 secs)</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, I guess there is a pre- and post- LLVM IR passes in <code>clang -O1</code> which is not present in <code>opt -O1</code>. So is there anyone who knows the difference between <code>clang -O1</code> and <code>opt -O1</code>? Any reference to official docs or source code, or ways to solve my initial problem will be much appreciated.</p>

<pre><code>*For Example (SQL of Course, just something to work with)*

If I had a Database named ""whatever"" &amp; it contained two tables.  
We'll name these ""tableA"" &amp; ""tableB"", respectively.

Let's say they look like this:

 - tableA - 
ID | Column1 | Column2 | Column3

 - tableB - 
ID | Column4 | Column5 | Column6

SELECT tableA.Column1, tableA.Column2, tableB.Column4 
FROM tableA 
INNER JOIN tableB ON tableA.ID = tableB.ID

Would give me something like:

 - newTable -

<p>I've followed <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/mobile/ios/build/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> introduction outlined on the Facebook developer site, and everything works as it should--at least according to their implementation. </p>

<p>Their way of doing things means the user is presented with the choice to connect their account to the app after applicationDidFinishLaunching is called, via a series of methods and calls within the app delegate. </p>

<p>I would instead like to only force this upon the selection of a button within a view controller buried elsewhere in the app. That is, I don't want to deal with authorisation when applicationDidFinishLaunching is called--I want my own method in a view controller to force it. Also, I will be referencing the Facebook classes from a number of my own view controllers, if that makes any difference.</p>

<p>I've searched far and wide and have yet to come up with a fully explained solution (or anything at all, really) for dealing with this. If anyone has ideas about how to go about this, please let me know. StackOverflow is a last resort most of the time :) </p>

<p>Edit: As beryllium brought up below, I can simply take everything that is meant to be in the app delegate and slap it into each individual view controller. It works, but is this the best way to handle this unique situation or is there a better implementation to be had?</p>

<p>Whenever I run a aggregate function on a field NUMBER(19,9), the resulting column returns a NUMBER datatype to Delphi, and on some machines it loads as a TBCDField with a precision of 38, and everything goes well, but on some machines it loads as a TBCDField with a precision of 255, and I get a BCD overflow on the field.</p>

<p>To replicate the problem, just create a table with a column NUMBER (19,9), and run a SELECT SUM(<i>column_name</i>) <i>column_name</i> FROM <i>table_name</i> GROUP BY <i>column_name</i>.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the column is a NUMBER(19,9), the resulting column will be a NUMBER with no precision defined.</p>

<p>In Delphi, load the query into a ADOQuery, with a DataSetProvider linked to it and a ClientDataSet linked to the DataSetProvider. After I call the ClientDataSet.Open, on some machines I get a BCD overflow message on the NUMBER field, but in a lot of machines it works nice.</p>

<p>Why am I getting this 255 precision on some machines, when the midas.dll, ADO, server, user, oracle client are all the same on both machines? Any ideas?</p>

One of my menu items is also affected by OnActivityResult and therefore that menu item doesn't work unless that method is posted into every fragment as well. This just seems like a lot of duplicated code. I would simply put everything in the main activity but that seems like bad practice and surely the main activity should have minimal code and the fragments should hold their own separate code. I need to use the OnCreateView method in my fragments in order to refresh an image adapter because the ViewGroup needs to be accessed.

<p>I am using a self written pagestore, which uses hazelcast. The pages are stored in the wicket default sessioncache and also in the hazelcast store. If I restart my webserver, the pages are stored from hazelcast, because I don't have anything in my session cache on my webserver anymore.</p>

<p>I go through my flow on my web application the following way:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to my page and filling my form</li>
<li>I go further and go to page 3</li>
<li>I restart my webserver, and click continue to follow to page 4. The page is stored from hazelcase and everything seems to work.</li>
<li>I fill some fields and click continue to page 5</li>
<li>I fill another form and click continue, ""here I get a Validation error""</li>
</ol>

<p>I suppose the following, because I tested and debugged through my application. After the restart of my webserver wicket is storing the wrong pages in the session cache. At the 5th page a wrong page is stored from sessioncache and the expected page is a different page then I want. On another position of my application I get a ""component has been removed from page"" error. Why I think that wicket is storing the wrong page in the sessioncache ? Because after the restart of my web application the ids of my pages changes. I have usually urls like: www.mysite.de/flow?1</p>

<p>The 1 is the pageid. Usually I get urls like www.mysite.de/flow?1 for 1st page. www.mysite.de/flow?2 for 2nd page and so on. After restarting my webserver the ids of my url dont change and I think that at this point the pages are stored wrongly into the session cache.</p>

<p>I am sorry, that I dont have code here. But it will help me alot if someone can describe how pagestore and sessioncache works in wicket.</p>

<p>I tested abit and it seems that the pageId didn't count further. The Session class has a method named nextPageId(). This method is called but the pageId is the same. The pageId in the url is always the same. For any reason after the restart of my webserver there is a problem with my Session. It don't counts the pages anymore right.</p>

<p>This is the view in second tab controller an instance of the generic UIViewController. Blue Background is a UIView that contains a segmented control (1,2,3,4). The steel blue navigation bar at the top is a simulated UI Element from Interface Builder. I need to put a navigation Controller such that it has a list table view that changed depending on the switch selected in segmented control UI. </p>

<p>I have following options</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add UINavController as root controller for second tab directly with table view inside it. In that case how do I accomodate the UIToolbar having segmented control?</p></li>
<li><p>I add UISegmentedControl as part of the view of Second Tab's view controller and add navigation based table view as another element to that view. Is this doable? How can I add a nav based controller to a UIView and control the frame so that it does not cover the UIToolBar. </p></li>

"8088553","1","","","2011-11-11 01:14:09","","1","529","<p>I have a Cocos2d app (1.0.1) that breaks on my iPhone 4 running iOS 4.2.8.  It is working fine in the 4.1, 4.3, and 5.0 simulators.  It works fine on iPhone 3g and iPod Touches running 4.2.1 also.  But it breaks a different way on the 4.2 sim.</p>

<p>On my phone it freezes when I attempt to set up the GL view and hook the director &amp; scene up to it.  There's no error and no easy explanation of what went wrong.  In the 4.2 simulator, the OpenGL view in question is simply blank but there is no freezing.</p>

<p>The freeze isn't even a ""crash,"" exactly.  It simply freezes up, then about 60-75 seconds later it unfreezes and continues as if nothing is awry at all.  After the device unfreezes, all my inputs seem to have been buffered up because they then all go through in sequence (including screenshots, sleeping the phone, hitting the Home button, etc)</p>

<p>Also, the app itself works perfectly after the unfreeze.  But,the game is only supposed to last 60 seconds, so at first it didn't appear to be working at all because it'd be in some weird state because it was frozen when the game was supposed to end.  But then just for debug purposes I lengthened the game time limit to 95 seconds left and it is totally playable after the unfreeze (usually when there's 15 seconds left) and seems to work flawlessly at that point.</p>

<p>Here's the viewWillAppear method where it freezes.  (I do virtually nothing in init:)</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated
{
    [super viewWillAppear:animated];

    if (self.view.subviews.count == 0)
    {
        UIImageView *scoreAreaBackground = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""ScoreBar"" ofType:@""gif""]]];
        scoreAreaBackground.frame = CGRectMake(0, CalculateScoreAreaTop(), GAME_SCREEN_WIDTH, CalculateScoreAreaHeight());
        [self.view addSubview:scoreAreaBackground];

        image1View = [[[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(CalculateImageLeft(), CalculateImageTop(), CalculateImageWidth(), CalculateImageHeight())] retain];
        [self.view addSubview:image1View];

        EAGLView *glView = [EAGLView viewWithFrame:CGRectMake(CalculateGridX(gameParameters.boardWidth), CalculateGridY(gameParameters.boardHeight), CalculateGridWidth(gameParameters.boardWidth), CalculateGridHeight(gameParameters.boardHeight))
                                       pixelFormat:kEAGLColorFormatRGB565   // kEAGLColorFormatRGBA8
                                       depthFormat:0                        // GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16_OES
                            ];

        [self.view addSubview:glView];

        CCDirector *director = [CCDirector sharedDirector];
        [director setOpenGLView:glView];
        [director setAnimationInterval:1.0/60]; 
        [director setDisplayFPS:NO];

        ...
</code></pre>

<p>I incrementally commented out every piece of code, and the ""offending"" line is this one:</p>

<pre><code>[director setOpenGLView:glView];
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't actually freeze on executing that line.  I can debug and step through the entire viewWillAppear method, and it responds fine.  Then whenever I hit ""Continue program execution"" the app freezes.</p>

<p>What I mean by it's the offending line is that I can comment out everything following that (and all code referencing Cocos2d in the rest of the app) and it will freeze the device exactly as described.  Then if I comment out that line it works fine with no freeze - except of course there's nothing happening in my OpenGL view.</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea what is wrong here?  It's particularly strange that this works fine on other devices and the simulator but doesn't work on just my phone, which makes me suspect some kind of build setting thing (I have it set to require armv6 since otherwise it wouldn't run on the older devices at all)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>As the choice is checked, a new fragment with a new question and set of possible answers is created.</p>

<p>How do I get the state of the radio buttons to stay between fragments? I've tried storing their ID in system preferences but when you navigate back the ID changes. Say it starts at 1, you navigate away, mark another radio button, navigate back and the ID (1) is different.

<p>I obviously need to downcast the result of the <code>component()</code> function in order to call methods defined in <code>DerivedComponent</code>. I had hoped that Swig would perform automatic downcasting like I believe that Boost.Python does.</p>

<p>Short of defining a whole bunch of typecasting functions in c++ and exposing them to Python, is there any better solution for downcasting using either Swig or Python? What are my options?</p>

I came across the <a href=""http://clojure.org/other_libraries"" rel=""nofollow"">Clojure zipper</a> function that seems like it should be perfect, but for the life of me I can't figure out how to use it.</p>

<p>For example, say I create a zipper with</p>

<pre><code>(def zipped (zip/seq-zip `(+ (- 1 2) 3)))
</code></pre>

<p>I understand this to represent a tree with + at the root, one that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>   +
 -   3
1 2
</code></pre>

<p>My zipper, though, doesn't agree with this: If I ask for the first node with <code>(-&gt; zipped zip/down zip/node)</code> it gives me <code>+</code> (which is correct) but it <code>(-&gt; zipped zip/down zip/down)</code> doesn't take me to <code>-</code>, instead it returns <code>nil</code>. Indeed, <code>(-&gt; zipped zip/down zip/rights)</code> gives the rest of the tree as siblings to the right of the root, which suggests to me that I don't have a tree at all:</p>

<pre><code>user&gt; (-&gt; zipped zip/down zip/rights)
((clojure.core/- 1 2) 3)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm pretty sure I'm representing my trees correctly because when I execute them I get the right answer. Does zipper expect a different layout?</p>

<p>I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and I want to execute a Python script from the terminal without using the full path. 
So i added /home/kyril/python/scripts/ to the PATH variable through putting the following into ./bashrc:</p>

<pre><code>kyrilpathvariable=""/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/home/kyril/Python/scripts/:/home/kyril/Bash/scripts""

if [ ""$kyrilpathvariable"" = ""$PATH"" ]; then
    echo PATH already exported

else

PATH=$PATH:/home/kyril/Python/scripts/
PATH=$PATH:/home/kyril/Bash/scripts/
export PATH

fi
</code></pre>

<p>(I know the if clause is not necessary but I did not like to have everything two times in my PATH if I type exec bash.)</p>

<p>Now the problem: this perfectly works for my Bash scripts, so after making them executable via chmod I can just type <code>$ script.sh</code> and it is executed. However if I type <code>$ python3 script.py</code> the following error is raised: <code>python3: can't open file 'script.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory</code></p>

<p>if I type in the full path to the script it works. Anybody has an idea what I am doing wrong? Do I have to add the directory to the PYTHONPATH? (As I understood this only helps for importing modules).</p>

<p>Thanks guys!</p>

<p>I'm trying to put magicsuggest in my bootstrap page. But no matter what I do, it ends up looking like the images below:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/DBIKV.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/klCwj.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I want it to look like a normal input box like this one:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/uPnY8.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I tried adding in the <code>cls</code> config option as <code>form-control</code> and also added in <code>form-control</code> to the magicsuggest <code>div</code> tag but neither of them worked.</p>

<p>Here's the HTML code I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""container-fluid""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""row""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""col-md-8 col-md-offset-2""&gt;
      &lt;div id=""magicsuggest""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""row""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"" id=""content""&gt;
      ...
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the magicsuggest jquery code:</p>

<pre><code>var ms = $('#magicsuggest').magicSuggest({
    valueField: 'id',
    allowFreeEntries: false,
    maxSelection: 1,
    resultAsString: true,
    method: 'get',
    data: result,
    renderer: function(data) {
      return data.name + "" ("" + data.year +"")"";
    }
  });
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using Bootstrap 3.3.2, Jquery 2.1.3 and MagicSuggest 2.1.4</p>

<p>EDIT: So, I got it to sort of work with a strange hack. It looks like the elements aren't getting the <code>form-control</code> class applied correctly. It gets applied to the outer <code>div</code> and completely skips the <code>input</code> button. So I added the following lines after instantiating magicsuggest and it <em>looks</em> okay. It still has issues when you enter a value and select the suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>  var ms = $('#magicsuggest').magicSuggest({
    valueField: 'id',
    allowFreeEntries: false,
    maxSelection: 1,
    resultAsString: true,
    method: 'get',
    data: result,
    renderer: function(data) {
      return data.name + "" ("" + data.year +"")"";
    }
  });
  // Hack for Magicsuggest
  $('#magicsuggest').removeClass(""form-control"");
  $(""#magicsuggest div input"").addClass(""form-control"")
  // End hack

<p>I skip adding the header and footer information for the document because I have a cover page. Because the various parts are disparate information, I have broken them down into chapters and subsections based on the various areas. Also, the users have the option of printing out a number of PDF's at once generated from database information. And at the start of each chapter, I set the footer text using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>this.PageEventHandler.footer = ""(Part 1) - Page: "";
</code></pre>

<p>Or at least I am trying to. When it comes to doing the second section (Employment History), if a person has been swapped around various departments a lot in their employment history they can build up quite a record and it overflows onto several pages.</p>

I want to loop through the rows of the DataTable, and with each row, fill an object in the same way as the above FillDataItem() method.</p>

<p>Of course I can just create an overloaded new method that takes the DataRow as the parameter:</p>

<pre><code>private void FillDataItem(DataRow datarow)
{
    this.CompanyCode = datarow[""COMPANY""].ToString();
    this.Name = datarow[""NAME""].ToString();
    //...and so on
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that is so similar to the IDataReader version, that I would really like to know how I can get achieve my goal in one method so that such similar code doesn't need to be duplicated.  Considering that I have a lot of fields, the FillDataItem method is like 200 lines long.  To copy/paste this into a DataRow version seems wasteful and hard to maintain.</p>

I can make this work with functions that take arguments (like tune() below) but I have not found a way to make it work for functions that take no arguments.</p>

<pre><code>struct Base { };
struct ObjA : public Base { };
struct ObjB : public Base { };
struct ObjC : public Base { };

template &lt;class ... Obj&gt; struct ObjGetter;

template &lt;class Obj, class ... Tail&gt;
struct ObjGetter&lt;Obj, Tail ...&gt; : public ObjGetter&lt;Tail ...&gt;
{
  using ObjGetter&lt;Tail ...&gt;::tune;  // resolve ambiguous lookups for tune()

  void tune(Obj * obj) { } // no problem with this one, disambiguated by obj type

  Obj * check() const { return 0; } // problem with this one, no arg to disambiguate
};

template &lt;&gt; struct ObjGetter&lt;&gt; { // to terminate the recursion
  void tune(void);  // needed by the using statement above but should not be used, hence different syntax
};

struct MyGizmo : public ObjGetter&lt;ObjA, ObjC&gt; // variadic
{
  void testit() {
    ObjA * a = 0; ObjB *b = 0; ObjC *c = 0;

    a = ObjGetter&lt;ObjA, ObjC&gt;::check(); // too ugly!
    c = ObjGetter&lt;ObjC&gt;::check(); // too ugly!

    tune(a); // no problem
    //tune(b); // correct compile-time error: no matching function for call to ‘MyGizmo::tune(ObjB*&amp;)’
    tune(c); // no problem

    // I would like a simple syntax like this:
    //a = check&lt;ObjA&gt;(); // should call ObjGetter&lt;ObjA, ObjC&gt;::check()
    //b = check&lt;ObjB&gt;(); // should give a compile-time error
    //c = check&lt;ObjC&gt;(); // should call ObjGetter&lt;ObjC&gt;::check()
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried the following but am not fully satistified:</p>

<p>First I can use a secondary, simply-templated class that gets carried around in the hierarchy, to reduce the ugly call to have just one template arg; yields something like:</p>

<pre><code>a = ObjGetterHelper&lt;ObjA&gt;::check(); // still ugly! MyGizmo user should not have to know about ObjGetterCore
c = ObjGetterHelper&lt;ObjC&gt;::check(); // too ugly!
</code></pre>

<p>I can use a Type2Type helper and give check() an argument, this works fine, looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>a = check(Type2Type&lt;ObjA&gt;()); // pretty ugly too
c = check(Type2Type&lt;ObjC&gt;()); // pretty ugly too
</code></pre>

<p>I could use macros but I don't want to go there...</p>

<pre><code>#define CHECK(X) check(Type2Type&lt;X&gt;())
</code></pre>

<p>I think that template aliases will provide a solution but I am using g++ which does not support them yet. Is there anything else in the meantime? Thanks much!</p>

<p>EDIT: The problem is fixed with WinDbg. I changed the baud rate to 115200 and inserted break (Ctr ^ Break) before Target system completely boots up. I am able to debug the code now. If I insert break after the target system completely boots up then I am unable to debug. I don't know exact reason for it but Happy with current situation.</p>

<p><code>
    Here are the things I have done</p>

<pre>1) Prepared Target system for debug mode by editing the boot.ini file. Added     “/debugport=com1 /baudrate=57600”  to boot.ini

2) On Host system, started kd.exe and seeing the following output

C:\Program Files\Debugging Tools for Windows&gt;kd.exe -k com:port=1,baud=57600
Microsoft (R) Windows Debugger  Version 6.6.0007.5
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
Opened \\.\com1
Waiting to reconnect...

3) Rebooted Target system, system boots slowly than normal boot and I am seeing some     messages &lt;&lt;below&gt;&gt; on Host system console

4) At this time, If I press Ctl-C on KD console then Target system freezes (hangs)         and proceeds if I enter ""g"" at kd prompt.  This means that Target system     is going to debug mode

5) However After some time I am seeing the following message on the host machine console

ERROR: DavReadRegistryValues/RegQueryValueExW(4). WStatus = 127  
ERROR: DavReadRegistryValues/RegQueryValueExW(5). WStatus = 127  
ERROR: DavReadRegistryValues/RegQueryValueExW(6). WStatus = 127  

After the above message there are no messages appearing on kd console.

I searched internet for ""ERROR: DavReadRegistryValues/RegQueryValueExW(6). WStatus =     127"" but didn't get proper reason for it.

I pressed Ctl^D and kd console and I am seeing 
READ: Timeout.  
READ: Wait for type 7 packet  
READ: Timeout.  
READ: Wait for type 7 packet  
READ: Timeout.  

I have tried above steps with following options ..but no luck

I disabled firewall &amp; antivirus software on both Host and Target systems. 
I unplugged and re-plugged serial cable connection between each trail
I have logged-in with Domain account local account with Admin rights 


Can someone show some light on how to proceed? Both systems are running on XP 32bit     SP3 OS.

Although it is still not really clear for me why Java NIO could be superior to standard sockets. When writing a server using either of these technologies, in most cases it comes down to having a dispatcher thread that accepts connections and further passes them to working threads.</p>

<p>I have read that in a threaded-model we need a dedicated thread per connection but still we can create a thread pool of a fixed size and reuse them to handle different connections (so that a cost of creation and tear down of threads is reduced).</p>

<p>But with Java NIO it looks similar. We have one thread that accepts requests and some worker thread(s) processing data when it is received.</p>

<p>An example I found where Java NIO would be better is a server that maintains many non-busy connections, like a chat client or http server. But can't really understand why.</p>

<p>I have a folder that contains a bunch of library projects and 2 projects generating actual executables. Both <strong>exe</strong> projects utilize the libraries from that folder to do its stuff but otherwise are separate programs. So, I have two SUBDIRS projects in that folder.</p>

<pre><code>super1.pro
super2.pro 
</code></pre>

<p>Also, there is not a lot of that, but <strong>some</strong> code paths in libraries depend on the superproject that is actually being built. The dependency is resolved by adding this into the .cpp file</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef SUPER1
</code></pre>

<p>So, what's the problem? The problem is that</p>

<pre><code>DEFINES+=SUPER1

<p>added in super1.pro will not be visible in subprojects and adding it into subprojects either directly or by means of .pri file fails to address the 
time when one will need to build the <strong>other</strong> project. It will have to be manual code change to <strong>super2</strong> then and this is just no good.</p>

<p>I have my solution to that problem below, but it just feels way too complex. If anyone has a better one that I am missing, please comment/answer.</p>

How to do that is described <a href=""http://www.vogella.com/articles/EclipsePreferences/article.html#preferencepage"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> <br>
Is it possible to add an entry field to the preferecne-page, which will be saved <strong>encrypted</strong>, in a Secure storage?</p>

<p>Until now I only found a way to use Secure storage programmatically. <br>
This is not a solution for me, because the preference-page entries are saved automatically.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong>
I did, what Tonny Madsen said to:<br></p>

<ul>
<li>extended the <code>SecureIPreferenceStore</code> class, which is an <code>IPreferenceStore</code>.</li>
<li>made the new class store all preferences in a secure storage by using a private variable of type <code>ISecurePreferences</code></li>
<li>set the new class as the PreferenceStore for the preference page</li>
</ul>

<p><pre><code>

 * or {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.preferences.InstanceScope InstanceScope}
 * 
* @param qualifier - the qualifier to look up the preference node. An example of a qualifier would be the plug-in identifier that the preference is associated with,
* (e.g. the ""org.eclipse.core.resources"" uses the preference node in the instance scope where the preferences for ""org.eclipse.core.resources"" are stored)

<pre><code>SELECT (SUBSTRING(p.filename,5,9))AS pub,

    COUNT(hc.queue)AS Hold,
    COUNT(pff.queue)AS ppf,
    FROM Preflight_Queue p

    LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT status,COUNT(*)AS queue FROM Preflight_Queue WHERE status = 4 GROUP BY status)hc on hc.status= p.status
    LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT status,COUNT(*)AS queue FROM Preflight_Queue WHERE status = 2 GROUP BY status)pff on pff.status= p.status
    group by SUBSTRING(P.filename,5,9)
</code></pre>

<p>Which give a record set like this:</p>

<pre><code>pub            Hold     pff    
RET-S0313       14      14
ABC-X0313       20      5
</code></pre>

<p>However in a separate  table (Preflight_Status) I need to get two additional fields.(forecolor and backcolor).</p>

<p>The two tables have relationship based on theses two fields:</p>

<p>preflight_queue.status = preflight_staus.id </p>

<p>SO I attempted the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SELECT (SUBSTRING(p.filename,5,9))AS pub,</p>

<pre><code>COUNT(hc.queue)AS Hold,(hc.forecolor)as holdfc,(hc.backcolor) AS holdbc,
COUNT(pff.queue)AS pff,(pff.forecolor)as pfffc,(pff.backcolor) AS pffbc   FROM Preflight_Queue p  LEFT OUTER JOIN (
                 SELECT p.status,s.forecolor,s.backcolor,COUNT(*)AS queue FROM Preflight_Queue p
                 JOIN preflight_Status s on s.id = p.status WHERE p.status = 4 
                 GROUP BY p.status,s.forecolor,s.backcolor
                 )hc on hc.status= p.status
 LEFT OUTER JOIN (
                 SELECT p.status,s.forecolor,s.backcolor,COUNT(*)AS queue FROM Preflight_Queue p
                 JOIN preflight_Status s on s.id = p.status WHERE p.status = 2 
                 GROUP BY p.status,s.forecolor,s.backcolor
                 )pff on pff.status= p.status  group by  SUBSTRING(P.filename,5,9),hc.forecolor,hc.backcolor,pff.forecolor,pff.backcolor
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>however since I now have to group the forecolor and backcolor fields. I get this results:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>pub          Hold     pff    holdfc    holdbc       pfffc         pffbc

RET-S0313     14      14      null       null        null         null
RET-S0313     null    null   0x000000    0xFF99FF    null         null
ABC-X0313     20      5       null       null        null         null
ABC-X0313     null    null    null       null      0x000000     0xFFCCFF
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>what I'm looking to do is to have it all on the same row like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>pub          Hold    pff    holdfc       holdbc      pfffc       pffbc

RET-S0313     14      14    0x000000    0xFF99FF    0x000000    0x000000

</code></pre>

<p>not sure how to get the one row?</p>

<p></p>

<p>My issue is that they don't play together.</p>

<p>They work as individual filters but if I want to check a development and bedrooms and then between a price bracket then it ignores the checkbox.</p>

<p>Visa versa - i set a price bracket and its ok, then i check a development and bedrooms and it ignores the price bracket. </p>

<p>Any Help would be amazing...</p>

<p>The result is the same whether I add the <code>.encode(""-utf-8"")</code> bit or not. </p>

<p>I tried this before with a similar website and practically identical code and it worked. 
But this one also has player names instead of just team names and some of the player names include special characters. That might be what causes some additional difficulty but. So what can I do to write the results to a file? </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> Alright, just to make sure I'm being completely clear:</p>

<p>I'm using the Tri.be Events plugin to allow a user to create a calendar of events. On the front page for this WordPress site, I need to display a list of upcoming events. Each event should be output like this:</p>

<p><img src=""//i.imgur.com/WzzTkqs.jpg"" /></p>

<p>This event should be output like this:</p>

<p>This is incorrect. If that where the case, I could easily output this on my own. The correct format is:</p>

<p>and all the others...</p>

<p>However, i would also like the Entity Frame Work context to track my entity's so the navigation property's on those entity's still work i can call SaveChanges... this doesn't seem to work if i have new classes.<br>
<strong>And that is the crux of it i cant figure out how i make EF and MVVM play nicely together.</strong> </p>

<p>The only thing i can think of doing is creating a class with one of my Entity's as a Private and re-create all the property's manually but surely this is the point of inheritance. </p>

            &lt;input type=""reset"" value=""Clear""&gt;

<pre><code>config.time_zone = 'Moscow'
config.time_zone = ""(GMT+04:00) Moscow""
config.active_record.default_timezone = 'Moscow'
config.active_record.default_timezone = :local
</code></pre>

<p>Also I've tried in rails console the following:
     ActiveSupport::TimeZone.all.map(&amp;:name)
wich returned a list of values, including <code>""Moscow""</code>.
<code>Time.zone</code> returned <code>(GMT+00:00) UTC</code> wich is not correct, it should be <code>(GMT+04:00) UTC</code>. Then I changed <code>Time.zone = ""Moscow""</code> and <code>Time.now</code> returned the correct value (... +0400).</p>

<p>So to fix it I simply used <code>Time.now + 4.hour</code>, but I also need datetime_select to display my local time. <code>Time.now + 4.hour</code> is not a correct solution.</p>

<p>Please, share any ideas how one can set default time zone to his local value.
Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Which gave me <code>18</code> results.</p>

<p>I then checked ""How many are REALLY online""  to answer this question i had to run:</p>

<p>When following these instructions, a call to a C function is translated by the native compiler to:</p>

<pre><code>    movq    ml_as_z_sub@GOTPCREL(%rip), %rax
    call    caml_c_call@PLT
</code></pre>

<p>(amd64 instruction set here, but looking at other architectures, the scheme seems to be rather uniform).</p>

<p>The function <code>caml_c_call</code> eventually does a computed jump <code>call    *%rax</code>, but it does a lot of things before and after. From asmrun/amd64.S:</p>

<pre><code>/* Call a C function from Caml */

FUNCTION(G(caml_c_call))
.Lcaml_c_call:
    /* Record lowest stack address and return address */
        popq    %r12
        STORE_VAR(%r12, caml_last_return_address)
        STORE_VAR(%rsp, caml_bottom_of_stack)
    /* Make the exception handler and alloc ptr available to the C code */

</code></pre>

<p>When one wants to frequently execute a couple of instructions that neither allocate nor raise exceptions, the above is a little bit overkill.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any experience in calling a small assembly routine directly from OCaml, without going through the <code>caml_c_call</code> stub? This probably involves tricking the native compiler into thinking that it is calling an ML function, or modifying the compiler.</p>

<p>The question is in the context of the library Zarith, where small assembly bits of code could compute and return most results directly, without having to go through <code>caml_c_call</code>, and only jump to <code>caml_c_code</code> for the difficult arguments that require allocation or exceptions. See <a href=""https://forge.ocamlcore.org/scm/viewvc.php/%2acheckout%2a/trunk/caml_z_x86_64.S?revision=42&amp;root=zarith"" rel=""nofollow"">this file</a> for examples of assembly bits that could be executed directly.</p>

"29704572","1","","","2015-04-17 16:20:42","","-1","60","<p>My final aim is cumbersome a bit. I have to get notified about any web requests outbound from within my C# application, which contains some black-box components.</p>

<p>My initial guess is pretty simple: in the Windows environment <code>WSA</code> is used to send web requests. That means if i intercept <code>socket</code> function call, i will be notified about every single web request outbound.</p>

<p>My following steps are pretty straightforward. 
C++/CLI DLL which should make injection in <code>socket</code> function was created. </p>

<p>Well i'm new to this technique, but some success with this step was achieved. For a very beginning i created a simple function <code>injection_body</code> which ouptuts <code>""intercepted""</code> into console and does not return the control to the original <code>socket</code>. That means any attempt to create a new socket will show <code>""intercepted""</code> line and throw an exception, probably due to the stack corruption. Well i'm ok with that for a while.</p>

<p><code>socket</code> function before the injection:</p>

<pre><code>7635430A 8B FF                mov         edi,edi  
7635430C 55                   push        ebp  
7635430D 8B EC                mov         ebp,esp  
7635430F A1 50 A0 38 76       mov         eax,dword ptr ds:[7638A050h]  
76354314 83 EC 0C             sub         esp,0Ch  
76354317 3D 73 2D 35 76       cmp         eax,76352D73h
...
</code></pre>

<p>and after</p>

<pre><code>7635430A E9 61 D4 DB F8       jmp         injection_body (6F111770h)  
7635430F A1 50 A0 38 76       mov         eax,dword ptr ds:[7638A050h]  
76354314 83 EC 0C             sub         esp,0Ch  
76354317 3D 73 2D 35 76       cmp         eax,76352D73h  
...
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>socket</code> called from native code of C++/CLI DLL directly, the injection works as intended: application shows <code>""intercepted""</code> and crushes. It proves injection to be made properly.</p>

<p>But this code</p>

<pre><code>using (var reader = new StreamReader(
       HttpWebRequest.Create(""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask"")
       .GetResponse().GetResponseStream())
      )
      Console.WriteLine(new string(reader.ReadToEnd().Take(100).ToArray()));
</code></pre>

<p>works normally, i. e. it prints a piece of the page instead of <code>""intercepted""</code> and does not cause any exception. </p>

<p>But if the same approach is applied to <code>CreateFileW</code> WinAPI finction it will affect both parts (either managed and native) of the application.</p>

<p><strong>Finally my main question is:</strong> why i cannot intercept <code>HttpWebRequest</code>? Where i'm going wrong?</p>

<p>Now i can see several 'possible' reasons for that behavior, but all of them don't look to be valid. Can <code>HttpWebRequest</code> use something else than <code>WSOCK32.DLL</code>? Can it use WSA lilrary instance, loaded not into my adress space?
Could MS cast some evil spells on <code>HttpWebRequest</code>? </p>

<p>I have no idea how to figure out what's the real reason for that behavior and how to fix it.</p>

I call this routine during initialisation.  This code below is iterating through all the components on the main form (OwnerComponent) and loading the settings of any toolbars it finds.  </p>

<pre><code>for I := 0 to OwnerComponent.ComponentCount-1 do begin
  ToolWindow := OwnerComponent.Components[I];  //  &lt;------------------------
....
</code></pre>

<p>This iterating takes some time (seconds - there are 1500-odd components on the form) and I'm getting a range error at the point shown.  I have ascertained that one or more items is being shed from the main form's components while this loop is executing, so eventually the loop tries to access one past the end of the array once this has happened (presumably it would be better to code this as a ""downto"" for-loop to prevent this).</p>

<p>Anyway, I need to find out where the main form is losing a component.  Can anybody give me any Delphi 2006 debugging tips on how to do this?  I wouldn't expect any main form components to be freed at this point in my program.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I found that when I had repositioned a toolbar's default dock position at design-time I had inadvertently docked it onto another toolbar, rather than the dock site that the other toolbar was in.  I fixed the problem by removing the toolbar from the toolbar it was docked in and adding it to the dock instead.  So the arrangement that caused the problem was:</p>

<pre><code>Dock 
  Toolbar 1
    Control 1
    Control 2
    Toolbar 2
      Control 3
      Control 4
</code></pre>

<p>and the fix was to arrange them thus:</p>

<pre><code>Dock 
  Toolbar 1
    Control 1
    Control 2
  Toolbar 2
    Control 3
    Control 4
</code></pre>

<p>It still points to a bug in the TB2k code though - one would assume it should be able to handle nested toolbars.</p>

  the other clients will switch to the same replica. (It is not
  acceptable to load-balance across the replicas as the replicas' data

My newest project will involve this scenario, and I'm not sure how to accomplish it (or if iCloud/CloudKit is able to accomplish it):</p>

<p>Let's say we have an education program for Instructors and Students. Students log their hours of attendance and basic course data. </p>

<p><em>Is there any way with CloudKit to be able to attribute the student's data to the instructor as well</em>? Essentially allowing instructors not to have to log the data since students have already entered it? </p>

<p>Or vice versa?</p>

<p>I understand how this would work in a traditional relational database but I'm not sure if CloudKit has any limitation on this. I'm pretty sure iCloud isn't going to do it... Any recommendations appreciated!</p>

<p>Thanks,
Charlie</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>One of the primary concerns is that instructors will need to be able to bring this data up on their own device. I am thinking instructors will need to validate the student log entry before signing off on the record. After sign off, the record will be attributed to the instructor. Then, I am hoping instructors will be able to open their app to see pertinent instructor totals.</p>

<pre><code>module.directive('toggleSection', ['$timeout', function ($timeout) {
    return {
        restrict: 'A',
        link: function (scope, element, attrs) {
            element.bind('click', function (event) {
                scope.$apply(function () {
                    var scopeProp = 'show' + attrs.toggleSection;

                    event.preventDefault();
                    event.stopPropagation();

                    scope[scopeProp] = !scope[scopeProp];

                    return false;
                });

            });
        }
    };
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>When the element is clicked, it toggles another property on the scope, which another element is bound to with <code>ng-show</code>. It's working as it should in the app.</p>

<p>I've added the following test for the directive:</p>

<pre><code>(function () {
    'use strict';

    // get the app module from Angular
    beforeEach(module('app'));

    describe('myCtrl', function () {

        var $scope, $rootScope;

        beforeEach(inject(function ($controller, _$rootScope_) {
            $scope = {};
            $controller('myCtrl', { $scope: $scope });
            $rootScope = _$rootScope_;
        }));

        describe('the toggleSection directive', function () {

            var testElement;

            beforeEach(function () {
                testElement = $compile('&lt;a toggle-section=""Test"" href=""#""&gt;Collapse section&lt;/a&gt;')($rootScope);
                $rootScope.$digest();
            });

            it('inverts the value of the specified scope property', function () {
                $scope.showTest = false;
                testElement.click();

                expect($scope.showTest).toEqual(true);
            });

        });
    });
</code></pre>

<p>In the real code there are properties like <code>$scope.showSection1 = false</code> and by adding console logs in the directive I can see the properties before and after clicking the bound element and they have the expected values (e.g. the property starts as <code>false</code> and after you click the toggle element once it changes to <code>true</code>).</p>

<p>However, the test always fails with 'Expected false to equal true'. I think it's to do with the <code>$apply</code> method, because none of the show properties seem to exist on the scope when I run the test.</p>

<p>Other tests I have (even in the same spec file), which don't use the directive can see properties on the scope just fine.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>For concretness, let's assume we have some relational DB tables containing various data from a company, e.g. Clients, Orders, Products, Shipments, Employees, etc. We can also have some of this data, particularly event-based, flattened, in another table. E.g. for each Order, we also create an entry in a </p>

<p>Now, I'd like to define (and perhaps let users define as well) various KPIs/KRIs on this data, e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>average Order price in last month</li>
<li>percent of Products which sold less than 10 items in last quarter</li>
</ul>

<p>Some KPIs/KRIs may be calculated both from data in the DB and an event currently being received by the system, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>probability that the Order just made will go in >1 Shipment, based on number of Products</li>
</ul>

<p>What data format for the KPIs/KRIs would seem to fit such a use case well?</p>

<hr>

<p>One idea I have, probably the most straightforward, is to store parametrizable SQL statements, to be run when evalutating a KPI/KRI. I couldn't let users define such things easily though.</p>

<p>Do people perhaps see another relatively straightforward way - perhaps using some helpful library or DSL?</p>

I considered using a myisam db and a full text search, but decided that because of the performance hit it would be better to stick with innodb. I also briefly considered using something like Solr, but a solution like that seems like overkill in my situation. </p>

<p>I am simply trying to add search functionality to a database of contact information. When the user enters say ""Smith"" I want the result to return and display all table rows where the first name, last name or even address contains the word Smith etc.</p>

<p>Tell me if this is the wrong approach, but I have settled on using a standard SQL string set up like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE firstName LIKE ? OR lastName LIKE ? OR email LIKE ?
</code></pre>

<p>Of course the actual query string will be considerably longer than this example because it will include most of the columns in the table. </p>

<p>1) I prefer to use prepared statements when querying the database for security, but when I set the sql string up how it is above, the code looks for a separate statement for each ?. How can I just repeat the same ""LIKE ?"" for each column? Or is there a way to set this up similar to:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE firstName, lastName, email LIKE ?
</code></pre>

<p>When I initially pass the string into the preparedstatement, I surround it with wildcards (%).</p>

<p>2) Will I be able to search both VARCHAR and INT columns?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I ended up using a small portion of the Spring framework so I could be able to use named parameters. Unfortunately JDBC does not have this functionality. This meant including a small portion of the Spring framework in my build path so I could use the jdbc jar.

However, now that I've got the page looking and working great, I want to break it out into includes so I can create more pages in the app without having to recreate the menu's and such.</p>

<p>One bit of code is the menu, which includes drop-downs that are activated by  links.</p>

<p>I'm using Custom Directives in Angular JS to break out the includes, so my menu looks something like this:</p>

<p>index.html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;sidebar-standard&gt;&lt;/sidebar-standard&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>includes/sidebar-standard.html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=""javascript:;""&gt;my link&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul class=""sub-menu""&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;a href=""anotherlink.html""&gt;test&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>app.js:</p>

<pre><code>app.directive('sidebarStandard', function() {
    return {
        restrict: 'E', // E = Element Include
        templateUrl: '/includes/sidebar-standard.html'
    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>This works, and my sidebar gets included, but the javascript drop-down menus no longer function. When I put the HTML directly into index.html, everything works, but when I add it via Angular, it doesn't. There are no errors in the console log.</p>

<p>How would one go about debugging this issue? Any direction anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p><a href=""http://drawthing.azurewebsites.net/Draw/View/sotest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drawthing.azurewebsites.net/Draw/View/sotest</a></p>

<p>The hub is fairly straightforward, allowing for sending and receiving paths drawn on the html canvas.</p>

<p>It is hosted on Azure Websites, but only on a single instance.  I've tested on a variety of devices and connections, and it generally works fine.  However, I recently ran into a case where it was able to send, but not receive messages.  I tried from multiple browsers with the same behavior.  Fiddler and F12 tools do not show any errors, and a longpolling connection stays open without any traffic or error. Even more bizarre, If I switch to</p>

<p><a href=""https://drawthing.azurewebsites.net/Draw/View/sotest"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>https</strong>://drawthing.azurewebsites.net/Draw/View/sotest</a> </p>

<p>then it works as expected. When it's failing, it appears to be using longPolling transport: monitoring a send shows 'transport=longPolling' in the url.</p>

<p>As best I can tell, this problem is limited to a particular network.  I try from my laptop while connected to the network, and it fails, but it succeeds while connected to a different network.  The network does have Websense and who knows what else on it, though I don't see any blocked messages in browser or fiddler.  This is odd to me though, since I would expect it to work anywhere port 80 is open to the host, which it obviously is.  I don't have much access to Websense, routers, etc, but could get help if I could narrow the cause a bit.</p>

<p>So, I'm really looking for any help debugging.  What would cause this behavior?  Is it even possible that WebSense or some router config would break some long-polling technique that SignalR uses if port 80 to the host is working?  Is the fact it appears to be constrained to a network a straw man?  What tool or server-side code can I use to see where the packets are getting lost?</p>

<p>I know dictionary.items() is a list of tuples, but I can't seem to figure out how to make a nice format that is also compatible with the SetValue() method of wxPython.</p>

<p>I've tried iterating through the list and tuples. If I use a <em>print</em> statement, the output is fine. But when I replace the <em>print</em> statement with SetValue(), it only seems to get the last value of each tuple, rather than both items in the tuple.</p>

<p>I've also tried creating a string and passing that string to SetValue() but, again, I can only get one item in the tuple or the other, not both.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Yes, I am passing the results of the dictionary.items() to a text field in a wxPython application. Rather than having the results like above, I'm simply looking for something like:</p>

<pre><code>BC 45
CHM 25
CMP 30
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing special, just simply pulling each value from each tuple and making a visual list.</p>

<p>I have tried making a string format and passing that to SetValue() but it gets hung up on the two values in the tuple. It will either double print each string and add the integers together or it simply returns the integer, depending on how I format it.</p>

How can I call a <code>RelayCommand</code> in my <code>ViewModel</code> (from my View of course) that will change the page on my view? And even better, change it using URI, so that I can pass a command parameter to file.</p>

<p>I'm totally lost on this. Currently I'm using <code>this.Frame.Navigate(type type)</code> in the View Code behind to navigate through pages.</p>

<p>I would really and I mean REALLY appreciate a description from a to z on what to do in this case.</p>

<p>I presume i could do something like building a framecontainer on my View and send it to my ViewModel and from there navigate the current frame to another. But I'm not sure how that works in Store apps.</p>

<p>I am really sorry for the lack of good questions, but I'm on a deadline and i need to get my View connected to my ViewModel in a proper way.. I don't like having both view codebehind as well as ViewModel code.</p>

"26499690","1","","","2014-10-22 03:05:23","","0","60","<p>I am still struggling a lot with the best way to pass around objects within the core data stack.  How I started for reference:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>App was super simple and single threaded core data access was perfect, only a few views and each needed a MOC.  Started with example code that created the Core Data Stack and one MOC.  MOC was stored in App Delegate.</p></li>
<li><p>App started to get more complex and finally realized why storing the MOC in the App Delegate was a bad idea.  Refactored code to create the MOC inside the App Delegate and inject the MOC into the root view controller.  From there App Delegate did not hold onto the MOC and view controllers injected it into other controllers that might need it.</p></li>
<li><p>Started to refactor app views in storyboard.  New tab bar, some nav controllers, split view controller, you know just some different ideas.  Step #2 turned into a nightmare.  Every time I made a change to the app view hierarchy in the storyboard I had to revamp each and every view controller to pass the MOC through the new hierarchy.  Sure apple says this is the right way, but I am not sure I am buying it, very tough to make simple view hierarchy changes without killing code.  Also now I have 4 views at the start of my app that don't even need the MOC.  However those views are the only link from the app delegate to the view controllers that do need the MOC.  So I am stuck injecting the MOC into all those view controllers just so they can pass it along to another view controller without every using the MOC.</p></li>
<li><p>App is even more complex and now I want a threaded Core Data Stack.  This means passing around the persistent store such that some 'processing' objects can create their own MOC on a background thread.  Should I create some sort of CoreDataStack object that can help manager this?  I.E. object that I can ask for the main thread MOC, or ask for a new 'worker' background MOC.  Seems like now step #3 was even more pointless, every and I mean every view in my app will need access to the main thread MOC and nothing else.  I guess I don't see this one changing for a while, but who knows I have changed a lot since I started ;)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think the idea of a 'CoreDataStack' object that can manage the distribution of MOCs might be a good idea.  That way at least that object can abstract away the implementation details of the way I choose to implement a threaded stack.  I.E. provide methods to shell out main MOC and background MOC.</p>

<p>That seems great until I start to think about how to pass this stack object around.  I can do exactly what apple recommends and pass this around from controller to controller injecting the main thread MOC into each view controller.  But as I said above about 5 minutes of re-work in a storyboard makes that fall apart extremely quickly.  Not to mention pass MOC to views that don't really need it just so they can pass to the next view in the hierarchy that may need it.</p>

<p>Finally my question.  Is there a better solution for my use case rather than passing around / injecting the MOC into each view controller???</p>

<p>The app uses <a href=""https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugins-keyboard"" rel=""nofollow"">Ionic keyboard plugin</a> to show the soft keyboard at the beginning of the round, and to hide it at the end. During the round, there is a simple form that reads the words and stores them upon submit:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""javascript:addWord();""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" id=""textbox_text"" value="""" /&gt;
    &lt;input type=""submit"" id=""textbox_skip"" value="""" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That after styling looks like this (showing soft keyboard):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/0NTBo.png"" alt=""text input, submit button, and keyboard""></p>

<p>I am getting two different behaviors depending on how the form is submitted:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When the form's submit button is clicked: the word in the textbox is submitted, the keyboard remains up, and the textbox is focused again. (<strong>the expected behavior</strong>, not hiding the keyboard at all).</p></li>
<li><p>When the soft keyboard's ""Go"" button is clicked: the word in the textbox is submitted, the keyboard goes down, the textbox is focused again, and the keyboard goes back up. (creating an annoying flash).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How can I prevent the keyboard from hiding after pressing the ""Go"" button just using Cordova?</strong></p>

<p>I have searched online and found <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/phonegap/EEwTtn-NCNo"" rel=""nofollow"">what seemed like</a> <a href=""http://www.x-services.nl/control-soft-keyboard-on-android-2-2-device-in-phonegap-cordova-application/311"" rel=""nofollow"">good leads</a>, but none of them gave me the desired behavior (even when the functions were being called, the keyboard was still hiding then showing).</p>

<p>Also tried ""cheating the keyboard"" by using a secondary (not visible) text input that was focused when clicking on ""Go"" (its keycode is 13, like 'enter'), to then focus the primary input text after the form was submitted. But no luck.</p>

<p>Then I tried by listening to the <code>native.keyboardhide</code> event as specified in the keyboard plugin documentation, also no success:</p>

<pre><code>window.addEventListener('native.keyboardhide', keyboardHideHandler);

...

// I tried a function similar to this one for when the key pressed was ""Go""
function keyboardHideHandler(ev) {
    ev.preventDefault();
    ev.stopPropagation();
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I tried Rami's suggestion, but the solution to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/15457800/4224337"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/15457800/4224337</a> didn't work either. The keyboard still goes down and up after clicking on ""Go.""</p>

<hr>

<p>So I guess my question can be divided in:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What happens when clicking on ""Go"" that makes it behavior different? (maybe the problem is that I don't understand the keyboard's flow); and</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a way of preventing the keyboard from hiding after clicking on ""Go"" using exclusively PhoneGap/Cordova (and any of their plugins)?</p></li>

<p>This way I would have to create schemamigration that adds authors, then a datamigration to transfer the data and fill the author_model_id for books, and finally a datamigration to remove the ""author"" column from ""books"" table. The question is, will my migration be valid after changing Book.author from field to property? I mean, if in one of previous migrations South tries to access Book.author (expecting a CharField) it will actually get a property that tries to get nonexistent model. How to do it right?</p>

Using dust.js, I've basically broken my page into template components, that are rerendered in response to certain events. One such component/template conceptually looks as follow:</p>

<p>[Label] [Input1] [Input2] [Input3]</p>

<p>All 3 inputs in this component have an onBlur event which is used to recalculate the value of the other inputs and which in turn causes the template to rerender. So for instance, if the user modified the value of Input1, both Input2 and Input3's values will be adjusted and rerendered.</p>

<p>The reason I rerender the template instead of just setting the values is that the template contains additional logic and elements that are rendered depending on the values (so for instance, certain values would result in an error message being rendered or an additional field being displayed).</p>

<p>So far so good, but this causes a focus problem. Take for example if the user modifies Input1 and then clicks on Input2. The onBlur will trigger, I'll update the values of Input2 and Input3 and then rerender the template. This in turn will cause the user's focus to be discarded, and they'll have to click on Input2 again.</p>

<p>I need a way to know that the user clicked on Input2 so that I can set the focus to it after the rerendering has been completed. As the onBlur event triggers before onFocus, I can't think of any way to do this.</p>

<p>Is there any solution other than bypassing the template rendering?</p>

<p>At the bottom under the ""public int binarcySearch()"" section is where I am stuck. I think I'll need a few if statements with returns and maybe some other things, but I don't know exactly what. I know what I'm supposed to do, but not how to do it. Here are some hints from the book which I'm not sure how to implement:</p>

<ul>
<li>If your lowIndex input is greater than your highIndex, then return -1 because you have finished searching the array and cannot find the target value.</li>
<li>Calculate an integer midIndex value using the formula described in the binary search discussion:
midIndex = lowIndex + (highIndex - lowIndex) / 2.</li>
<li>Check the value of the target array at the midIndex. If it matches your targetValue, you are done, so return your midIndex as the final result!</li>
<li>If your targetValue was not found, then you need to recursively call binarySearch(), modifying the lowIndex and highIndex parameters to remove parts of the array that don’t contain the target.
<ul>
<li>If the middle value too high, use the existing lowIndex and a highIndex equal to midIndex -1 in your recursive function call.</li>
<li>If the middle value too low, use a lowIndex equal to midIndex + 1 and the existing highIndex in your recursive function call</li>
<li>Your recursive binarySearch() call will return the index of the target value or -1 if not found, so you can return that result directly from the parent binarySearch() code.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

It seems to be special in that you can access the instance from anywhere just by using <code>Form1</code>; even though you only have one form instance, you can access that without passing a variable around.</p>

<p>However, I was suprised to find, that if I use the TPL to make a number of tasks, and run them together, and each of them call <code>Form1.GetHashCode</code> they return different values.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if I place a public member object inside <code>mainform</code>, then set a value on one of its properties, that won't be reflected in the tasks.</p>

<p>What is going on here - it is as though there is a new instance for each task, but that can't be right?  That would take ton's of memory/initialisation surely, and also I can't <strong>see</strong> lots of forms.  I know I can't access controls from other threads, but this is just an integer.

I didn't really understand what was being said, so I turned to the textbook for clarification and found a workable example that might help me out. I'd like to discuss this example with you all.</p>

<p>The example says:</p>

<pre><code>During triangle rasterization we are using Gouraud interpolation 
of colors across a triangle to determine the colors of pixels.The triangle we are 
rendering has vertices A, B, and C, with screen-space coordinates A = (30,10), 
B = (30,50), and C = (60, 30).
</code></pre>

<p>The vertices have these RGB colors:</p>

<pre><code>Ac = (25, 160, 30)
Bc = (25, 110, 30)
Cc = (25, 115, 30)
</code></pre>

<p>What are the RGB colors are point (a.) (30,30) and point (b.) (45, 30)?</p>

<p><strong>For (a)</strong></p>

<p>I spose the R and B values of A and B - they are the same, and then, since 30 lies right between 10 and 50... take the average of A and B's color value for G. </p>

<p>So (25, 135, 30) is the point's color values. I'll use this value in the next problem - so let's call it point M.</p>

<p><strong>For (b)</strong></p>

<p>the only point we have with a 30 as their y coordinate is C. Point M is at (30,30). So, since (30,30) and (60,30) have the same R and B values... I assume they are the same for the (45, 30) one. Again,we just average out the G value, since 45 is exactly between 30 and 60. </p>

<p>So the answer is (25, 125, 30).</p>

<p><strong>So my question is - is this correct? If so - is this what is meant by interpolation - this sort of...averaging? How does Phong shading differ from this?</strong></p>

<p>It's simply so that IIS Express does not pick up transformed (TransformXML in PostBuild) Web.config files from the bin/ folder. </p>

<li>I have tried to create temporary files that are imported by ""configSource"" but they are not copied if not enlisted in the project.</li>
<li>I don't want to have my debug settings as default settings in the project (I'm reusing the transformations for App.config in WebJobs- and Integration tests projects in the same solution).</li>
<li>The proposed solutions of overwriting Web.config in the source folder are just not right.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simply said: I just want the Web.config to be transformed and take it for a spin by hitting F5. That's it.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to make IIS Express read the transformed bin/Web.config file when starting a Webapp in debug mode by hiting F5? Anyone knowing of any hidden tweaks for IIS Express to make it work the correct way?</p>

<p>This would allow me to scroll horizontaly without have the header column moving, and to scroll verticaly without having the header row moving (by some <code>absolute</code> positioning within its parents I guess ?).</p>

<p>My main problem is I can't figure how to display these two main elements next to each other. Indeed, if I use the CSS property <code>float</code> I can't have a scrollable overflow.</p>

<p>So here I am, requiring a little of your time to help me positioning these two elements without messing with the scrolling.</p>

<p>Here you will find the html part of the code:

                    Barname
                    Barfoo
                    Zorzor

<p>(In both versions of the <code>FormFieldData</code> table, <code>FormFieldDataID</code> is the primary key.)</p>

My problem is that we need to run MySQL on a computer where MySQL is already installed as Service. We dont have the access to root. Since the MySQL Service is important for an application which is running on the computer we cant just remove/reinstall it. Maybe the application will be used again. So i tried to install xampp and try to start the MySQL not as service but it seems to be impossible. </p>

<p>Is it possible to start the MySQL not as Service? The following appears whenever i start the XAMPP Control Panel:</p>

<pre><code>[mysql]     MySQL Service detected with wrong path
[mysql]     Change XAMPP MySQL and Control Panel settings or
[mysql]     Uninstall/disable the other service manually first
[mysql]     Found Path: ""C:\private\private\bin\mysqld-nt"" --defaults-file=""C:\private\private\my.ini"" MySQL
[mysql]     Expected Path: c:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe --defaults-file=c:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini mysql
</code></pre>

<p>So i have been trying to disable the Service and then manually start</p>

<pre><code>mysqld.exe --defaults-file=c:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini
</code></pre>

<p>Afterwards the process is running, and i get the following in the console:</p>

<pre><code>C:\xampp\mysql\bin&gt;mysqld.exe --defaults-file=c:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini

<p>Then i cant connect to mysql:
C:\xampp\mysql\bin></p>

<pre><code>mysql -u root

<p>I was using a forloop() initially for this.. but then the conditions got a bit more advanced on things I needed to check for, as well as the output based on found/not found..</p>

<p>My problem is ensuring that on consecutive loops.. the 'else' on the (no access) potion only gets echo'd once...  but of course on every 'loop' it will check from the top and if not a match output the 'no-access' text.. (on every iteration).. where it should only output once.</p>

<p>Originally there was only a few  if() statement/checks in the foreach() loop.. where a simple break; took care of things fine...</p>

<p>but these if()'s turned into if/else.. which means the else will get 'triggered' on the next 'loop'..  how can this be prevented?</p>

<p>is there some other sort of 'control' I can use to ensure the main if/else only gets executed once?   </p>

<p>Sorry , I am having a hard time trying to describe this one, hopefully the code explains it all (and the problem)</p>

<p>thanks.</p>

<hr>

<p>update:
Current State:  reverted back to foreach() loop.</p>

<p>User is only authorized for 2 vids (#5 &amp; #6 we'll say..can be any of the 6 in reality)</p>

<p>Upon first loop/iteration.. vids 1-4 output (no access for you!) (because they dont, only #5 &amp; #6 as stated above)</p>

<p>no. 5 outputs the embed code fine (access)</p>

<p>no. 6 says 'No access for you'.. (even though they do/should have access)</p>

<p>Upon the scond iteration..vids 1-4 are duplicated, and again say ""No access for you"" (outside of it being a duplication..this is correct).. however, vid #5 NOW says ""no access for you"" (first loop it outputted fine, second loop it is looking for a new 'match' while not what I want.. in theory this is correct.. but should have a duplicate)</p>

<p>Vid #6 is NOW outputting the embed code (where as on first loop it did not)..</p>

<p>The user has only purchased access to 2 vids.. so the loop only happens twice.</p>

<p>but I get '12' echo's</p>

<p>No matter what I should only get 6 echo's  with 1 out put per video  (available/not available -or- no access)</p>

<p>I cant seem to wrap my head around this today.. :(</p>

<p>Goal I want achieve:</p>

<p>6 outputs TOTAL</p>

<p>each output (echo) should ONLY have:
available or not available printed (this is the nested conditional check for the blank title)
-or-
no access</p>

<p>there are 6 video to check against.
the user can have purchased access to 1 or up to all 6 vids </p>

<p>first check is: is the webinar name in their purchased array found in the total available 6 vids available</p>

<p>second tier conditional check:
if YES (match found == access)...then check to see if the title is missing (if there output access [video embed code]... if not there output text 'not available yet')</p>

<p>(going back to first conditional check) if there is NO ACCESS (match not found).. output 'no access' text.</p>

<p>This works if I wanted duplicates on the stage/page.. (but I dont!)  LOL..</p>

<p>I need to be limited to ONLY 6 outputs,.. as there are only a total of 6 vids available.</p>

<p>I DO NOT WANT:</p>

<p>on loop 1 it outputs access for vid#1 and #2-#6 are no access..
on loop 2 it re-states all of these outputs, has vid#1 no-access now, vid#2 has access and vids #3-#6 are no access...</p>

<p>etc.etc..  and the cycle continues.    I'm getting lost on this one!..</p>

The reason is that the empty array that $resource.query() returns never gets populated in the test environment because the promise doesn't get resolved.  Here is my beforeEach in the test suite.</p>

<p>When I put only dummy URLs in like Google and Facebook, this works perfectly.  However, when I add the first URL, the Tomcat server cannot even deploy.  Looking at my logs, I see this at the top of a very long stacktrace:</p>

<pre><code>SEVERE: Parse Fatal Error at line 19 column 146: The reference to entity ""version"" must end with the ';' delimiter.
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The reference to entity ""version"" must end with the ';' delimiter.

<p>Line 19 column 146 indeed points to the ""version"" portion of that long URL I have in the list of context parameters.  So obviously ""version"" is some kind of reserve word.  If I remove the ""version"" parameter from this URL, ""request"" is also a problem.</p>

<p>I can get around this by doing just <code>http://opendap.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/thredds/wms/</code> as the URL (because ultimately I want a list of hosts not specific URLs anyway), but I was wondering what one would have to do to get around this otherwise...  Is there a way to include URLs that have such ""reserve words"" in web.xml?</p>

I have run into a problem when validating my app's connection with the quickblox service though. In order to authorize the connection I need to get a token from quickblox by sending a post request that contains my app id, auth_key, timestamp, a nonce, and a signature. When I send the post request however, the server replies back with status code 422 that my signature is invalid. The signature is made by taking the app id, auth key, timestamp, and nonce and generating a hmac-sha1 hash with it. I have verified that my hmac-sha1 generator is working correctly, so I don't know if my post code is wrong or whether it's something else, because it always comes back with signature error.

I need to link the form's recordsource to a query object which I have already defined. Let's say I have field1, field2, field3, etc. in my query. The end product I would like to present is</p>

<ol>
<li>on top of the form, there are several text boxes for user to input filtering criteria of field1, field2, field3 ... and</li>
<li>on a click of a button, a datasheet displays at the bottom of the form with the filtering criteria applied</li>
<li>besides the existing fields in my query, I need to include at the end of the datasheet a customized column based on certain calculation result from field1 and field2. Some text could be displayed, for example ""Late"", ""Early"" or ""On Time""</li>
</ol>

<p>I have come up with two design approaches, but due to the lack of experience in VBA programming I am not able to accomplish either one of them right now...</p>

<p><strong>Design 1:</strong></p>

<p>I have a main form with the criteria input text boxes. This main form is not linked to any data source. Then I have a subform at bottom whose data source is dynamically set by reading the text boxes' values in the main form.</p>

<p><strong>Design 2:</strong></p>

<p>I have a single form, but I shift all the criteria boxes to the Form Header section. This form has a record source from my query object. The detail section is used for displaying the data sheet with the form's filter property set to user criteria.</p>

<p>I am not able to do design 1 because I don't know how to set the data source for my sub form dynamically. I am also not able to do design 2 because my form's header section does not appear even I have checked in the design view the form header/footer is enabled.</p>

<p>What can I do to realize my form design? Any alternative design suggestions?</p>

<p>I am using Access 2003 for this development, but I hope my code can be upgradable to Access 2010 in future.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your advice.</p>

<p>I have a Class with 15 properties. Each class represents information about an item of stock (how many there are, how many recently shipped etc). Each time a class is initialized by passing it a stock code, it gathers all the data from other sources and stores it as properties of the class.</p>

<p>I want to be able to initialize <em>n</em> number of classes, dependent on the length of a list (never more than 200). I want to name those classes by their stock code, so that I can call up the information later on and add to it. The only problem is I don't know how to use a variable to name a class. I don't really want to write out 200 classes long hand because I'm sure there is a better way to do it than <code>Dim</code>ing: <code>Stock1 As C_ICODE, Stock2 As C_ICODE, Stock3 As C_ICODE</code> etc and initializing them in order, until input (from <code>ActiveCell</code>) <code>= """"</code> or it hits the maximum list length of 200. I would like to create as many class instances as there are stock codes if possible, and generate them something like this:</p>

<p>PseudoCode:</p>

<pre><code>For Each xlCell In xlRange
    strIN = xlCell.Value

    Dim ICode(strIN) As New C_ICODE

    ICode(strIN).lIcode = strIN
Next
</code></pre>

<p><code>Let</code>ting <code>classname.lIcode = strIN</code> provides the class with all the user input it needs and then it carries out various functions and subroutines to get the other 14 properties.</p>

<p>I would be very grateful if someone could let me know if this sort of thing is possible in VBA, and if so, how I could go about it? Definitely struggling to find relevant information.</p>

I thought it my have been a problem with the # character, so I removed it but got the exact same response.  The code is successfully reporting other 404's, so somehow there's a situation that creates false positives (or negatives, whichever you want to call it).  the ""If query = """" Then"" is so that there aren't GETs to empty URLS, VBA doesn't like those.</p>

<p>I'm pretty stumped here, and was hoping someone would be able to help me out.  Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I have a solution with three separate projects, the main project and a BLL and a DAL project (n-tier). In the DAL I have generated Linq To SQL classes from an existing database, as well as a class that has all the crud operations, and another class for custom data classes.
The main project references the BLL and the BLL references the DAL.</p>

<p>In the main project I am populating a grid from a method in the BLL that calls the method from the DAL and that returns a list. I have stepped through the code and I keep getting the error.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Object reference not set to an instance of an object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and it brings me to this method in my designer of the Linq To SQL classes (.dbml)</p>

<pre><code>public BasicInventoryDBDataContext() : 
base(global::System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[""BasicInventoryConnectionString""].ConnectionString, mappingSource)
</code></pre>

<p>When I try and databind to a grid.
I have looked in my webconfig for the DAL project and it seems legit because the connection string is in there.</p>

<p>I have looked around on SO and have seen similar questions to this error, but none pertaining (that I have found) when the DAL is in a separate project, let alone when using Linq To SQL.</p>

<p>I have tried, deleting the DAL and BLL projects and recreating them ( Not a big deal since, I have just started the project, and its in its infancy ). I haven't had this issue when I have the Linq To SQL classes in the same project. 
Any idea's?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
Here is the page I am using to make sure things are working before continuing.</p>

<pre><code>#region Initialization

public BasicInventoryDAL bl = new BasicInventoryDAL();

#endregion

protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    rgVendor.DataSource = bl.GetVendorBrowse();
    rgVendor.DataBind();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have put a break of initialization of BasicInventoryDAL, and when I step through, its brings me to the DAL Project</p>

<pre><code> public class BasicInventoryDAL
 {
    #region Initialization

    public BasicInventoryDBDataContext dc = new BasicInventoryDBDataContext();

    #endregion

    public List&lt;VendorBrowse&gt; GetVendorBrowse()
    {
        List&lt;VendorBrowse&gt; lst = new List&lt;VendorBrowse&gt;();

        var queryGetVendorBrowse = from f in dc.vw_Vendor_Browses
                                   select f;

        foreach (var v in queryGetVendorBrowse)
            lst.Add(new VendorBrowse
            {
                VendorID = v.VendorID,
                VendorName = v.VendorName,
                City = v.City,
                Country = v.Country
            });

        return lst;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As soon as it gets to the <code>public BasicInventoryDBDataContext dc = new BasicInventoryDBDataContext();</code> That's when the error gets thrown. </p>

<p>Here is the connection string in my web config</p>

<pre><code>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;

<p>I'd like to use the SingleImage feature of Install Shield to create and deliver a single installation file (e.g. setup.exe) to my customers.  It seems, however, that I must attach the digital certificate to an msi file, which is embedded within setup.exe, by Install Shield. </p>

I have set it up to check for updates before launching, no prerequisites to install, and didn't need to modify security settings. I set the application up for offline availability.</p>

<p>I set up <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services"" rel=""nofollow"">IIS</a> and published the application. This succeeded.</p>

<p>I used ClickOnce to install the application to the development server which hosts the application files. This worked fine to install. It brought up the security warning about not verifying publisher information I clicked okay and then my application came up.</p>

<p>I browse from a remote machine to the installer page for my ClickOnce application and click the install button. The dialog window pops up that says ""verifying requirements"" and then an error pops up that says ""Cannot continue this application is improperly formatted"" and provides details (see below). I never get the security warning I see when I install it local to the server.</p>

<p>What is strange to me is that if I choose that the application is online as well as offline the ClickOnce install will work and the application will launch. Why won't this work? The deployment is really really simple, just the EXE file and the <code>exe.config</code> file. No DLL files or anything like that.</p>

<p>I've now created a clean new project and added in everything and get the same result with ClickOnce deployment. I don't know if this is a configuration issue or a security/access issue.</p>

<p>I can install using ClickOnce to the webserver hosting the files. Any other machine though and it fails to install.</p>

<p>I also set up a new user account, ""clickonceuser"", and gave them FULL control over the web server's directory. I set up IIS to connect as ""clickonceuser"" and hit the test button and it verified user and filesystem access was okay.</p>

Also, I receive the data from an external connection (JMS in this case, but it doesn't really matter, it could be a DB, or whatever).</p>

<p>Being that I am new to Swing, I am still a little confused about who should fire the events, who should listen to them and how to make so that for a modification to my dataset I will have both the tables to update.</p>

<p>Now, a little example of my dataset structure as well as some dummy data:</p>

<pre><code>class Student{ String name; Classroom classroom; boolean goodStudent}
class Classroom{ Sting name; List&lt;String&gt; coursesTaught; List&lt;Student&gt; students;}

public List&lt;Classroom&gt; classes;
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, my dataset will be the <code>classes</code> field in a Controller class and the two JTables will have to show things in different ways.
Namely, Table1 will have to show something like:</p>

<pre><code>Classroom Name | Courses
4a             | CS101, CS102, CS103
4b             | BM101, CS102
4c             | I101, CS4100
</code></pre>

<p>So basically, for each Classroom, the list of courses.</p>

<p>Table2 should instead show things like:</p>

<pre><code>Student Name   | Good?
Mark Spencer   | true
Philippe Mann  | true
Tom Sayer      | false
</code></pre>

<p>I should see ALL the students, from all classrooms.</p>

<p>As you can see, the data is the same, but it is shown in different way.
What I would like to do is that, when my data changes, the tables will automatically update too.
For what I understood so far, I will have to subclass AbstractTableModel and create two different TableModels for the kind of data I want to show; what I don't get is:</p>

<ul>
<li>How will the Models get their data, once some change happens?</li>
<li>Who should notify the models of this change?</li>
<li>Is it enough to call ""fireTableXXXEvent()"" to trigger the view refresh?</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope I made myself clear enough...
In any case, thank you very much!

<p>It does the autocomplete as right when I type in a J it comes up with Jon, but now when I hit enter it doesnt fireoff the KeyPress event.  It just sits there.  I tried putting in a break point and when I type in the first letter J it fires the KeyPress event.  Then when i select the string ""Jon"" from the autocomplete source and then I hit enter the event no longer fires.</p>

<p>This seems to indicate that JMeter has a problem with filling out the body of a request. I can get rid of this error by specifying a parameter with the request, but I want the entire body to be the photo data. Here's the CURL line of what I want accomplished:</p>

<p><code>curl -u testuser:testpass ""http://localhost:8080/photo"" -T photo.jpg -H ""content-type:image/jpeg""</code></p>

<p>I've tried setting the content-encoding to UTF-8 as I've seen in one post, but that changed nothing.</p>

<p>I'm running Java 1.7.0 on Windows 7 x64. Nothing of interest gets generated in jmeter.log, and wireshark tells me that JMeter isn't sending the request.</p>

I am testing on both iPhone 3GS (version 4.3) and iPhone 4 (version 5.0 beta), and suddenly on the 3GS, when I click on Off, it doesnt stop - I still see the location symbol on the status bar. </p>

<p>Previously, it worked fine on the 3GS - I could start, stop, send to background, launch again. etc. and my OFF button worked perfectly - whenever I stopped location, the location indicator disappeared. The SAME code runs on my iPhone4 and no issues. </p>

<p>My question is - is there a way to ""clean"" a test iphone? Wondering maybe there are some ""cookies"" kinda of stuff left that I should be cleaning so it will work again...otherwise, I am clueless...</p>

These functions are in dll so can be called over by same application or separate applictions. This dll talks to hardware so I want to return 'busy' if another function is already running rather than have to wait on it. I thought best approach is to use CreateMutex instead combination of OpenMutex.</p>

<pre><code>int FunctionExposedByDll()
{

    hMutexAPI = CreateMutex(0, 0, API_RUNNING_MUTEXT );

    if (!hMutexAPI )
    {
        DWORD dwErr = GetLastError();

        if (dwErr == ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS )
            return MY_ERROR_BUSY;
    }

    // actual function here

    CloseHandle( hMutexAPI );

}
</code></pre>

<p>So if the mutex is already created, I should get <code>ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS</code> which tells me system is executing an api and I should return. However the above code always return a valid mutex even if the prior function has not returned and mutex handle is not closed.</p>

<p>I also tried <code>CreateMutexEx</code> function and in that case when I try it the 2nd time it returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED when I am expecting ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS. So my question is what do I need to do to get correct status that mutex already exist when it exist? </p>

<p>I am using windows 7</p>

<p><strong>**Update**</strong></p>

<p>Based on Rob K answer, I have changed the code to following:</p>

<pre><code>int FunctionExposedByDll()
{

    hMutexAPI = CreateMutex(0, 0, API_RUNNING_MUTEXT );


    DWORD dwErr = GetLastError();

    if (dwErr == ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS )
    {
        CloseHandle( hMutexAPI); // i have to call this but it contributes to first chance exception too!
        return MY_ERROR_BUSY;
    }

    // actual function here

    CloseHandle( hMutexAPI );

}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I am getting/reading the correct status of semaphore but releasing is an issue. If I don't release it when its in 'busy state', than I always get the ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS even when the other API has finished. So CloseHandle() fixes that but creates another issue. When I return and close <code>CloseHandle()</code>from busy state and the first API completes later and want to close the handle, I get first chance exception. I don't see how can I avoid that!?</p>

What I want to do is to display the coresponding Category from 'categories' table for each Product from the 'products' table. I tried to squeeze the two tables in one view and create a @foreach within the @foreach but that only listed all the categories instead of assigning the coresponding category based on the category_id from the products table.</p>

<p>Controller</p>

<pre><code>$products = products::all();
$categories = categories::all();

return View::make('products.index')-&gt;with('products', $products)-&gt;with('categories', $categories);
</code></pre>

<p>View</p>

<pre><code>@foreach($products as $key =&gt; $value)
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;{!! $value-&gt;id !!}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;{!! $value-&gt;product_name !!}&lt;/td&gt;
        @foreach($categories as $key2 =&gt; $value2)
            &lt;td&gt;{!! $value2-&gt;category !!}&lt;/td&gt;
        @endforeach
        &lt;td&gt;{!! $value-&gt;product_price !!}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;{!! $value-&gt;updated_at !!}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
@endforeach

<p>products table</p>

    {
        $table-&gt;increments('id');
        $table-&gt;integer('category_id')-&gt;unsigned()-&gt;nullable();
        $table-&gt;string('product_name', 255)-&gt;unique();
        $table-&gt;decimal('product_price', 10, 4);
        $table-&gt;dateTime('updated_at')-&gt;default(DB::raw('CURRENT_TIMESTAMP'));
    });

    Schema::table('products', function($table) {
        $table-&gt;foreign('category_id')-&gt;references('id')-&gt;on('categories');
    });
</code></pre>

<p>categories table</p>

<pre><code>    Schema::create('categories', function($table)
    {
        $table-&gt;increments('id');
        $table-&gt;string('category', 255)-&gt;unique();

- <a href=""https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/java8/Java8.g4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/java8/Java8.g4</a></p>

<p>I generated the class files and tried to parse the <code>Java 8 JRE</code>, but somehow at <code>java.text.SimpleDateFormat.java</code> it crashes with:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded
</code></pre>

<p>It also <strong>crashes</strong>, when I'm trying to parse that single file alone.</p>

<p>Can this be solved somehow? Obviously <code>ANTLR V4</code> can't handle files with more than <strong>2000 LOC</strong>? Is that a correct assumption?</p>

<p>What I've done so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Changing assigned memory to <code>JVM</code> in multiple steps <strong>from 256MB up to 4GB</strong> - it then changes to </p>

<p>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space</p></li>
<li><p>To ensure that there is no syntactical problem with the input-file<br>
  At first I <strong>removed the first half</strong> of the file -> <strong>parsing seems okay</strong>,<br>then undid that action and <strong>removed the second half of the file</strong> -> <strong>parsing seems okay</strong></p></li>

<p>I have a less conventional model where a node has two parents (a genealogy database). In this, <strong>node.mat_id</strong> and <strong>node.pat_id</strong> relate to the maternal and paternal parent nodes respectively. SQL Alchemy is OK with this too:</p>

<pre><code>mother = db.relationship(""Node"", 
    foreign_keys = ""Node.mat_id"", remote_side=""Node.id"")
father = db.relationship(""Node"", 
    foreign_keys = ""Node.pat_id"", remote_side=""Node.id"")
</code></pre>

<p>(using Declarative).</p>

<p>So getting both parents of a node is straight forward. My problem is with  getting the <em>children</em> of a node with this setup. I can't find a way to set up a relationship the equivalent of:</p>

<pre><code>offspring = db.relationship(""Node"", 
    foreign_keys = ""Node.mat_id | Node.pat_id"")
</code></pre>

<p>The best I have managed is to declare mat_offspring and pat_offspring relationships separately and create a member function offspring() that returns the appropriate one. It works but seems inelegant. Is there a better and more conventional way?</p>
