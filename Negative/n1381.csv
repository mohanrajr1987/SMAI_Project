<pre><code>A &lt;- sample(1:100, 25)
B &lt;- sample(1:25, 25)
df.1 &lt;- data.frame(A,B)


C &lt;- sample(1:80, 15)
D &lt;- sample(1:15, 15)
df.2 &lt;- data.frame(C,D)
</code></pre>

<p>Then we plot the data using <code>ggplot</code></p>

<pre><code>library(ggplot2)

(plot2 &lt;- ggplot(NULL) + 
   geom_point(data=df.1, aes(x=A, y=B), 
              color='black', cex=1, pch=16 ) +
   geom_smooth(data=df.1, aes(x=A, y=B), method=""lm"", size=1, 
               se=FALSE, colour=""black"", linetype=2)+
   geom_point(data=df.2, aes(x=C, y=D), 
              color='black', cex=1, pch=15 ) +
   geom_smooth(data=df.2, aes(x=C, y=D), method=""lm"", size=1,  
               se=FALSE, colour=""black"", linetype=1)+
   scale_y_continuous(""Y scale"") +
   ggtitle(""Plot"") +
   theme_bw()+
   theme(plot.title = element_text(face=""bold"", size=20),
         axis.title.x = element_text(vjust=-0.25),
         axis.title.y = element_text(vjust=1),
         axis.title = element_text(face=""bold"", size=15)
   )
)
</code></pre>

<p>So we have created and modified the title, axis, etc.</p>

<p>But I want to create a legend which shows the <code>linetype</code>'s from the <code>geom_smooth()</code> function of <code>df.1</code> and <code>df.2</code>. It should be in the top right of the graph.</p>

<p>(so for <code>df.1</code> we want a solid line and <code>df.2</code> a dashed line)</p>

<p>The example <a href=""http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Legends_%28ggplot2%29/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> walks you through an example, but the data comes from within the same data set</p>

<p><code>my-element.html</code> looks like this:</p>

<p>When I run it as it is, everything works fine.</p>

<p>When I try to Vulcanize the <code>components.html</code> file, and then open the same page with the Vulcanized version, I get the following error in the console</p>

    });
</code></pre>

<p>Which seems to be what is causing the bug, as window.Polymer only expects an Object as a parameter.</p>

<p>I am using <a href=""https://github.com/Polymer/grunt-vulcanize"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""grunt-vulcanize"">grunt-vulcanize</a> to do the actual Vulcanizing, and my config looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>vulcanize: {

            excludes: {
              imports: [
                'polymer.html'

<p>Here is my problem: </p>

<p>I have a public website (i.e. on the internet) that will allow any user to sign up to. The website will be developed using ASP.net webforms. These users may create other users and assign these users different roles.</p>

<p>Different roles have different restrictions and the menu is displayed appropriately. For example, a user acting as an administrator can see all menu options. Whereas a limited user will only see some of these menu items.</p>

<p>There needs to be the ability for users on our end to modify what pages certain roles can access. For example, if Role1 can do task X, we would like to be able at some point modify Role1 to no longer do task X. This would be done using an application built in-house.</p>

<p>User types (roles) are to be saved in the database. User permissions (what pages each type can have access to) are also to be saved saved in the database.</p>

<p>Here is something I am thinking of doing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Implement the authorization and authentication set up built in to ASP.net using the web.config file</li>
<li>Use Sitemaps to dynamically create menus/breadcrumbs from the database</li>
</ol>

<p>I believe it is possible to do the second one using custom providers (please correct me if I'm wrong). But I am not entirely sure if it's possible to configure the web.config file dynamically.</p>

<p>I suppose this is really more of a yes/no answer but I would just like to make sure I'm not going in the wrong direction. I will be using VS2008 and .net 3.5 framework. </p>

<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>The value of $(var.ConfigSuffix) varies based on solution configuration (e.g. "" (Debug)"", "" (Stage)""). For ""Release"", it is set to an empty string.</p>

<p>I have various solution configurations, all but one use a non-password protected PFX certificate, ""Release"" uses a password protected PFX. I deal with this by conditionally defining $(var.PfxPassword) in ""Release"" configuration only, and then installing the certificate as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?ifdef $(var.PfxPassword) ?&gt;

<p>I believe error 0x80070056 indicates an incorrect password, however I have used the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd347671.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Get-PfxCertificate</a> in PowerShell to verify that the password I am using is correct.</p>

<p>The SQL function this needs to come from currently loops through Accounts and for each account ID gathers all the relevant data above for each account, e.g. variable1, 2, table, etc. So per Account ID it returns all the variables and the table with its 3 columns and all rows. </p>

<p>So to simplify, for every Account ID, the XML file needs the above structure appended to the file. Now my dilemma comes when I try to create the XML file with all these varied parts. </p>

<p>The first issue is how to combine the Table information and the variable information into a single XML  tree. I know it is possible to create an XML Forest with Elements from a table, but the issue is that the for each account there is a set of variable data and a table. I have considered table_to_xml but this takes directly from a table and I have no idea how I would append the variable elements before the table/xml.</p>

<p>I have considered doing text arrays:</p>

<pre><code>for rec in execute cmd
loop

  cmd:= 'select xmlelement(name ""Account"",
        xmlelement(name ""Variable1"", '||var1||'))';

  execute cmd into vtext
  varray[n] := vtext;
  n++
end loop;
</code></pre>

<p>And then possibly putting the table nested into the xmlelement as a text array as well. Keep nesting until I have all the 's and then send those to XML after they are all together.</p>

<p>The next issue is combining all these Accounts into one overarching element  within the same XML file. </p>

<p>If anyone has any ideas of how to approach solving this I would greatly appreciate the help. I feel like I am over thinking the entire process, or maybe it is too ridiculous to do in SQL and maybe I should try these operations in a scripting language like Python.</p>

However, you can also change the state and update that page dynamically using Javascript.  How do you construct such a system that does not involve replicating one's work in both Javascript and PHP?</p>

<p>Now, for the specific question that relates to the above.  I have a navigation bar for an educational website.  Depending on the URL provided by the user, you can be at various levels of navigation: field, subject, course, section, lesson.  For example, if the user accesses the following <code>index.php?field=Social_Sciences</code>, the following XML will be returned and parsed by PHP and sent to Smarty such that the appropriate subjects are listed:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;subjects&gt;
    &lt;subject&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;81&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Sociology&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Sociology&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;path&gt;/data/material/Social_Sciences/Sociology/&lt;/path&gt;
    &lt;/subject&gt;
    &lt;subject&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;82&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Economics&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Economics&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;path&gt;/data/material/Social_Sciences/Economics/&lt;/path&gt;
    &lt;/subject&gt;
&lt;/subject&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, if a user goes to <code>index.php?field=Social_Sciences&amp;subject=Economics</code>, PHP would parse the following and send it to Smarty:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;courses&gt;
    &lt;course&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;65&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Introduction to Microeconomics&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Introduction to Microeconomics&lt;/description&gt;

        /data/material/Social_Sciences/EconomicsIntroduction_to_Microeconomics/

        &lt;/path&gt;
    &lt;/course&gt;
&lt;/courses&gt;

<p>Now, the problem is the user can also dynamically navigate using AJAX--that is, they can click through the navigation without reloading the page.  That means the navigation XML then has to be parsed by jQuery, which means I have to write the same code to parse the XML twice--once in PHP and once in Javascript.  After this system proved unwieldy, I started only using AJAX even on the initial load but this is sub-optimal in terms of speed and number of requests.  (If you think this is trivial, there are other examples of such issues in my code.)  How can one continue to use PHP templating and dynamic AJAX updating without re-writing the same parsing code twice in both languages?</p>

<p>We have an app that handles sending data to a server via simple HTTPS, no problem all works fine.  HOWEVER, if the packets are sent via a satellite phone, the latency of transmissions is a lot longer than the typical milliseconds handled on land-line high-speed network access.  So, the exact same packets being sent out are broken up automatically via Windows API when through the following functions:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE INTEGER InternetOpen IN WININET.DLL
DECLARE INTEGER InternetCloseHandle IN WININET.DLL
DECLARE INTEGER InternetConnect IN WININET.DLL
DECLARE INTEGER HttpOpenRequest IN WININET.DLL
DECLARE INTEGER InternetQueryOption IN WININET.DLL
DECLARE INTEGER InternetSetOption IN WININET.DLL
DECLARE INTEGER HttpSendRequest IN WININET.DLL
DECLARE INTEGER HttpQueryInfo IN WININET.DLL
DECLARE INTEGER InternetReadFile IN WININET.DLL
</code></pre>

<p>I am not specifically controlling the ""packets"", just building an entire request and sending it and get an answer.</p>

<p>What APPEARS to be happening is this.  The packets are getting split into smaller chunks as typical with a large amount of data.  However, by the time the get to the satellite, they are NOT re-assembled in the correct sequence thus acceptance at the final destination fails.</p>

<p>So, now the question...  Is there a way I can specifically let Windows know to slow down the frequency that packets are sent out to HELP prevent the latency issues?  Since we don't have access to the satellite system,  we can't prove this is the issue, but it appears they get the packets, just don't put them back together in the correct sequence.</p>

<p>My question is, is there any way that when one of these attributes are chosen in the drop down, the corresponding number of cell inlines would be shown?</p>

<p>For example, if I were trying to create a row in the admin and I selected 'single' as the row type, only one cell inline would show for me to enter information on the field.

<pre><code>#mainLabel {
    width      : 300px;
    height     : 100px;
    font-size  : 200%;
    background : #A60000;

<p>And I give animation <code>slideDown()</code> when it's sth wrong with login or password to <code>#mainLabel</code>, but when animation is done, background and borders stay at the same place except text.</p>

<p>I don't know what's going on, but it's depends on animations that I've done before. And when these previous animations are going, text from the ""not animating right now things"" is somehow moving. </p>

<p>That would mean that animations on higher elements would have influence on the lower elements. That doesn't make any sense! I've been researching for that issue, and google that, but I found nothing.</p>

<p>I run that both Chrome and Firefox, same issue.</p>

<p>Requesting help. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>@ps2goat
Yea that snippet presents what I done. Except that these ""#leftStreak, #rightStreak"" are animating too, and when it's going that text in the ""#mainLabel"" is somehow moving. ONLY text, everything is in same place. So that is the rest: </p>

<p>JS:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#leftStreak"").hide().delay(1300).slideDown(700);
$(""#rightStreak"").hide().delay(1400).slideDown(700);
$("".inputLabel"").each( function() {
    $(this).hide().delay(2200).slideDown(500);
});
$(""input"").each( function() {
    $(this).hide().delay(2400).slideDown(500);
});
</code></pre>

<p>and then when sth wrong:</p>

<p>JS:</p>

<pre><code> $(""#mainLabel"").slideDown();

<p><strong>More Info</strong>
The app is <em>not</em> in sandbox mode.</p>

<p>I was thinking that because the app appears in my account settings that is why it is only working for me but if I look at other fan-gated tabs, they don't have the permissions notification pop up so that can't be the case?</p>

<p>There are already a number of questions on SO that revolves around subscription billing management. I am currently working on a SaaS solution that will require a fully automated billing system.</p>

<p>What I am not looking for when asking this question is not advice on implementing towards a specific payment gateway or stuff like that. Instead I'd like advice on what kind of approach to take.</p>

<p>The functionality that I need is a system that can handle upgrades, downgrades, recurring billing, cancellations, etc. Initially for one product only, but it might over time be a requirement that the system can handle multiple products (by products I mean fundamentally different products, not different variations of the same product).</p>

<p>As I see it there are a number of possible approaches when you need a solution like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Code a billing server yourself</strong> that supports this and is decoupled from each product so that it can handle multiple independent products.</li>
<li><strong>Use a hosted solution</strong> like <a href=""http://recurly.com"">Recurly</a>, <a href=""http://chargify.com"">Chargify</a>, <a href=""http://spreedly.com"">Spreedly</a> or <a href=""http://cheddargetter.com"">CheddarGetter</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The advantage of using a hosted solution is obviously that you don't need PCI certification, the concern is outsourced and it is a lot faster to get up and running. These advantages come at a cost however: The most important support function for your product - i.e. the billing is not in your control. Additionally you have less control and flexibility.</p>

<p>What would you do? If we look beyond the PCI requirements I would definately prefer to have a system coded in-house that could do this kind of job. On the other hand I've heard from numerous sources that coding a system like this is a pain.</p>

<p>Any advice is highly appreciated. Also, if you advice to code it yourself, any experiences on how to do it or if there are any opensource projects (no matter the language, what I'm after is not the code but the structure) that I can benefit from would really mean alot.</p>

<p>However, now I need the terms component filter by another field.

<p>Is there a way to implement or extend this component functionality to do that? I don't want to use <code>solr</code> facet because it searches only by the prefix and it do not search for words in the middle in a case insensitive way (OR I am wrong?).</p>

<li>Implement a solr auto suggest over a multivalued field </li>
<li>Filter  suggestions by another field </li>
<li>My autosuggestion search should be   case insensitive </li>
<li>The autosuggestion search should suggest words   that are in the middle ex. <code>Field = ""Hello World""</code>. The query <code>""wor""</code> should return the sample field.</li>

<p>We are given <code>IQueryable&lt;Invoice&gt;</code>, we are not given <code>IQueryable&lt;InvoicePosition&gt;</code>. How should I find invoices that have positions, where GroupName is 'Fuel'?</p>

<pre><code>IQueryable&lt;Invoice&gt; invoices = InvoiceRepository.List();
IQueryable&lt;Invoice&gt; invoicesThatHaveFuelPositions = 
    from i in invoices
    where ?
    select i
</code></pre>

<p>EntityFramework should be able to translate it to proper sql query.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>As Mark Seemann wrote, I can use:</p>

<pre><code>IQueryable&lt;Invoice&gt; invoices = InvoiceRepository.List().Include(""Positions"").Include(""OtherInclude"");
IQueryable&lt;Invoice&gt; invoicesThatHaveFuelPositions = 
    from i in invoices
    from p in i.Positions
    where p.GroupName = 'Fuel'
    select i;
</code></pre>

<p>There is a problem. When I use this filtering, I lose ""OtherInclude"". I think that this is not proper way of filtering when using EF. I'll have to change it to:</p>

<pre><code>IQueryable&lt;Invoice&gt; invoices = InvoiceRepository.List().Include(""Positions"").Include(""OtherInclude"");
IQueryable&lt;Invoice&gt; invoicesThatHaveFuelPositions = invoices.Where(???);
</code></pre>

<p>But what should I write in Where?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Changed Include(""Position"") to Include(""Positions"").</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Alex James gave link to the tip (<a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/alexj/archive/2009/06/02/tip-22-how-to-make-include-really-include.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/alexj/archive/2009/06/02/tip-22-how-to-make-include-really-include.aspx</a>), which suggests:</p>

<pre><code>IQueryable&lt;Invoice&gt; invoicesThatHaveFuelPositions = 
    from i in invoices
    where i.Positions.Any(p =&gt; p.GroupName == 'Fuel')
    select i;
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to work and doesn't influence EF includes.</p>

<p>It takes a XML object, splits it by  XML elements, and adds the elements to a queue. I'm unmarshalling into a POJO to extract just the  element list, which then goes into the split component. </p>

<p>My problem is that I can't seem to get the POJO into ActiveMQ without being XML. Even if I try marshalling it into a POJO again before submitting, it still arrives in the MQ as XML. I'm wondering, if I have JAXB annotations on an object which gets put into ActiveMQ, does it automatically convert to XML? If so, how do I stop this?</p>

<p>For example my code suppose to refactor if-else statements in a way that the shortest branch would appear first.

However, when I fetch values from a table, integers are always fetched as string.</p>

<p>I am using PHP5.4 (5.4.16-1~dotdeb.1) and MYSQL5.5 (5.5.31+dfsg-0+wheezy1). It is written <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqlnd.install.php"">here</a> that MySQL Native Driver is enabled by default in PHP5.4.0. But I still get string values.</p>

<p>I initialize a PDO object as follows.</p>

<pre><code>try {
        $dsn = 'mysql:host=' . DB_HOST . ';dbname=' . DB_NAME . ';charset=utf8';

        $db = new PDO($dsn,DB_USER,DB_PASS);

        $db-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);

        $db-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, false);

    } catch (Exception $e) {
        header('HTTP/1.1 500');
        exit;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>When I insert, I tried to use <code>execute(array(...))</code> format and also used <code>bindValue(...,PDO::PARAM_INT)</code>, but they did not make a difference.</p>

<p>For example, here is how I insert a new row.</p>

<pre><code>public function insertList ($db,$account_id,$list_name) {
    $sql = $db-&gt;prepare('INSERT INTO lists VALUES (?,?,?,?,?)');

    try {
        // $sql-&gt;execute(array($list_name,0,0,0,$account_id));

        $sql-&gt;bindValue(1,$list_name,PDO::PARAM_STR);
        $sql-&gt;bindValue(2,0,PDO::PARAM_INT);
        $sql-&gt;bindValue(3,0,PDO::PARAM_INT);
        $sql-&gt;bindValue(4,0,PDO::PARAM_INT);
        $sql-&gt;bindValue(5,$account_id,PDO::PARAM_INT);
        $sql-&gt;execute();
    } catch (PDOException $e) {
        header('HTTP/1.1 500');
        exit;
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        header('HTTP/1.1 500');
        exit;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is how I fetch rows from a table</p>

<pre><code>public function fetchLists ($db,$account_id) {
    $sql = $db-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM lists WHERE account_id=?');

    try {
        $sql-&gt;execute(array($account_id));

        $result = $sql-&gt;fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    } catch (PDOException $e) {
        header('HTTP/1.1 500');
        exit;
    } catch (Exception $e) {

<p>The following line of code is triggering the error:</p>

<pre><code>if ($Name=='ProxiedIP') { return true; }
</code></pre>

<p>This version runs without any problem at all:</p>

<pre><code>if ($Name=='proxiedIP') { return true; } 
</code></pre>

<p>It seems like somehow the token 'ProxiedIP' is fouling something up, but I cannot even think of how a string literal would be translated by the parser in a way that could hang the server up like this.  BTW, I know for certain that <strong>$Name!='proxiedIP'</strong> and <strong>$Name!='ProxiedIP'</strong>.  </p>

<p>Here's the entry in the apache error log:</p>

<pre><code>[Fri Jan 18 18:15:12.924419 2013] [core:error] [pid 27676:tid 3427232831232] [client 12.345.67.890:34482] Premature end of script headers: index.php, referer: http://mySite.com/
</code></pre>

<p>I searched for 'ProxiedIP' as a keyword for every component that I can think of on my system and I'm coming up with nothing.  The more imperative question for me though is how a string could somehow have this impact in a comparison check.  Any ideas?</p>

<hr>

<p>Also noteworthy that the PHP error log is completely silent about it.  I'm enabling error output at the top of the page, but the script never finishes loading so that may be a factor.  Here's how I'm setting it:</p>

<pre><code>error_reporting(E_ALL);

<p>Because the code worked <a href=""http://codepad.org/Dx4dtVya"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, it seems more likely that it could be something specific to the platform implementation.  I'm running this on an instance of Gandi.net's 'Simple Hosting' service, which runs Varnish for application acceleration.  It may also be worth mentioning that the code is being loaded in an iframe in a separate domain.  </p>

<p>I am also doing some intensive work with the headers, and this seems like the greatest potential source of the problem, although the strange thing as far as I'm concerned is the way the error is being triggered.  Also, there's no common header that I'm aware of called 'ProxiedIP', although that use conflict is the only thing that seems like it could make sense so far.  Regardless, I don't see it.</p>

<p>To me, the real item of relevance is the mere fact that a string comparison is crashing the server.  I've been programming in PHP for over 10 years and I have never had anything like this happen before.  I'm trying to understand the logistics behind how it could even happen.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update:  I've tried the following variation, and it still produces the same result:</p>

<pre><code>if ($Name === (strtoupper(""p"").'roxiedIP')) { return true; }
</code></pre>

<p>It was asked whether I would post the full code, but the script for the iframe side is 1400+ lines long so that's not really feasible.  I'm adapting the segment in question to try running it in a new script though and will post the results.</p>

I want the iOS app to perform an action as long as the user is panning the Google map.  (I'm using the standard method of bridging between Javascript and Objective-C code--creating an IFrame and picking it up on the other side as a page load--and that part is working fine.)  </p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that the Google Maps API running on Safari on the iPhone does not pick up 'pan' events continuously.  It only picks up one event at the very end of panning.  (I figured this out using the iPhone simulator web inspector tool available within Safari.)  Google Maps running in Desktop Safari, in contrast, picks up a continuous stream of events whenever the user pans the map--which is what I want.</p>

<p>Here's the Javascript code which runs differently between mobile and. desktop Safari.</p>

<pre><code>google.maps.event.addListener(map, 'bounds_changed', function(){
    console.log(""This browser is noticing panning."")
})
</code></pre>

<p>To summarize, in desktop Safari, it prints continuously during a 'bounds changed' action, while in mobile Safari it only prints once at the end of the action.</p>

<p>Is this an issue with Google Maps or with iOS Safari?  How can I fix it?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> While 'bounds_changed' events are not triggered properly in iOS Safari, a 'drag' event <em>is</em> triggered continuously.  Still, however, the bounds (retrieved with <code>map.getBounds()</code>) of the map are not updated until after the drag motion is complete, so listening for a 'drag' is not much help if I need the bounds.</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: undefined is not a function

<p>The throw occurs in the <code>alert.getComponent()</code> call in the following JSX file:</p>

<pre><code>/** @jsx React.DOM */

    render: function() {

        this.setState({isVisible: false});
    }
});

function AlertNotice(level, message, code) {
    this.level = level;
    this.message = message;
    this.code = code || null;
}

AlertNotice.prototype.getComponent = function() {
    // What should go here? Using React.createClass() doesn't help
    return (

    );
};

function SuccessAlert(message) {
    AlertNotice.call(this, 'success', message);
}

);

React.renderComponent(
  TestComponent,
  document.getElementById('content')

</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Alert</code> component comes from the React-Bootstrap library. The <code>div</code> components seem extraneous but I found them necessary to satisfy the react framework. In reality, I'll be storing the <code>AlertNotice</code> instances in react state and then generating react nodes from them.</p>

<p>What is the proper way to go about this?</p>

<p>Here's a hint. If I replace <code>return alert.getComponent();</code> with the following hardcoded alert, the AlertDismissible components render without error (in duplicate) but I get a warning:</p>

<pre><code>return (
    &lt;AlertDismissible level=""danger"" message=""Goof"" code=""777"" /&gt;
);
</code></pre>

<p>The following is the warning message I get with the above replacement, including a link that explains I should set <code>key=</code> to a unique for each alert:</p>

<pre><code>Each child in an array should have a unique ""key"" prop. Check the render method
of SpecimenSetManager. See http://fb.me/react-warning-keys for more information.
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I simply replace the code inside of <code>AlertNotice.prototype.getComponent</code> with the above hardcoded alert, I get the same <code>TypeError</code> message as before. </p>

If you cancel the paypal activity you are brought back to the original activity. From here if you click the button again nothing happens. I tried printing a basic message to console in the OnClick method and it didn't even show, it doesn't seem to be registering the clicks. I'm Assuming the problem has nothing to do with the layout xml file or the manifest file. I would post an image but i cant because im new, all you need to know is that its a checkout screen with a paypal button really.</p>

We have code written so that when the site experiences an uncaught exception it runs through the exception and any inner exception and emails us the details.  I've read that it's best for performance to only use release version dlls but I wondered if we went that route, would that still allow us to inspect the exceptions and get line numbers and so forth about where the error occurred?  Or do we have to have the debug version out there to get that information?  Thanks.</p>

Right now I am testing a couple lines of code to see if it will place the boat going in the up direction. How my program is set up is that if, for example, the user clicks on the aircraft carrier button to set his aircraft carrier, the program should also set the ai's aircraft carrier. The boats are placed on a button array, called tlba. aifirstclicki is set by a random generator so that it will choose a random row. aifirstclickj chooses a random column, in conjunction the two pinpoint a spot on the button array (which is 10x10). I wrote the following code to try to make it so that if the program has an outofboundsexception error,or in other words if the program chooses a first spot that will eventually cause an outofbounds exception error because the for loop will keep adding spots until aiclickcount = 5, it should start over and pick a different spot until it finds a spot that will allow it to place all 5 spots. I keep getting stuck in an infinite loop though. </p>

<p>My page have a menu, when the user click it, hide div blocos and shows the content (using url parameter setted in menu)</p>

<p>My Jquery Code:
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $('div.blocos').hide();
        $('div#divMenuBloco').show();</p>

<pre><code>    $('.clickable').click(function(){

    });
}

<p>MENU div item:

<p>That part works Great... All menu links hide and fadeIn the content...</p>

<p>So I added a Link ""Back"" inside content div...</p>

When I try to set text in my code, the result is very strange. See the image to understand:</p>

         CGContextDrawImage(context, CGRectMake(0, 0, 317, 27), img.CGImage);
}
@end

<p>Which works to a degree</p>

<p>My image is <strong>upside down and backwards</strong>!! why on earth would that be? I have checked the image itself which is fine. Where would this transform be getting applied??</p>

<p>I also have further questions, like:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How can I choose to show the BG image or perhaps toggle its alpha on selected screens? There is one particular screen where there is a back button and it covers the image, which I dont want, I would rather just not display the image on that screen.</p></li>
<li><p>The image is not the entire height of the <code>UINavigationBar</code> its just a small slice of it (27 as you can see). How can I keep the tint color for the rest of the bar using this technique?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So I will try to explain my situation.</p>

<p>I have 2 projects: the first one is named <strong>model-gen-wifipnsd</strong> and it contains only the <strong>model classes</strong> that are used by the second project (named <strong>WIFIPNSD</strong>) that represent the web application.</p>

<p>1) So for the <strong>model-gen-wifipnsd</strong> I have this <strong>pom.xml</strong> file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;project xmlns=""http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""

  &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;

  &lt;groupId&gt;model-gen-wifipnsd&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;model-gen-wifipnsd&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;packaging&gt;jar&lt;/packaging&gt;

    &lt;dependencies&gt;      
            &lt;dependency&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;org.hibernate.javax.persistence&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;hibernate-jpa-2.1-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;version&gt;1.0.0.Final&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;/dependency&gt;       
            &lt;dependency&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;org.hibernate&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;hibernate-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;version&gt;4.3.11.Final&lt;/version&gt;

<p>Ok, into a model class (inside <strong>model-gen-wifipnsd</strong> project) I have mapped this field:</p>

<pre><code>@OneToMany(fetch=FetchType.EAGER)
@OrderBy(""flgTipPrg"")
@JoinColumns({
    @JoinColumn(name=""COD_MEC_ATT"", referencedColumnName=""COD_SCU_UT""),
    @JoinColumn(name=""DAT_ANN_SCO_ATT"", referencedColumnName=""DAT_ANN_SCO_RIL"")
    })
private List&lt;Twp1007Progetto&gt; twp1007Progettos;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I have putted the <strong>@OrderBy(""flgTipPrg"")</strong> to order the list according to this field defined into the <strong>Twp1007Progetto</strong> model class:</p>

<pre><code>@Column(name=""FLG_TIP_PRG"")
private String flgTipPrg;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that using this <strong>@OrderBy(""flgTipPrg"")</strong> I obtain this exception:</p>

<p>If I remove the <strong>@OrderBy(""flgTipPrg"")</strong> annotation I have no exception and the application correctly start (but the list is not ordered).</p>

<p>How can I try to fix this issue? From what I have understand reading online this issue could depend by the fact that that I can have 2 versions of <strong>antlr</strong> dependency in my project but I am absolutly not sure about this and I don't know how to solve it.</p>

<p>Why? What am I missing? How can I try to fix this issue?</p>

Basically, when the first dropdown is changed, it filters the second dropdown to show only the applicable choices. If the first choice (value: ""none|"") is chosen in the first dropdown, it shows no choices in the second</p>

<p>It works great, most of the time. Here's the issue: If you select the first choice in the first dropdown, the second dropdown clears out. But if you then choose another option in the first dropdown, the second stays empty when it shouldn't.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate if you can help me figure this out. You can find the dropdown boxes here: <a href=""http://goinspire.com/jwrp-hotel-registration/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goinspire.com/jwrp-hotel-registration/</a>.</p>

<p>I have put a check print statement in <code>development.py</code> at beginning and end of the file. 
<code>print INSTALLED_APPS</code></p>

<p>and when I runserver it prints all value of this <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> list(I mean all apps I'm getting in development.py. INSTALLED_APPS variable is in common.py and development.py is importing common.py).</p>

<p>I've no clue where am I making mistake. (Is this because I'm using list instead of tuple for installed_apps variable? and I'm using <code>from common import *</code> but I dont think that this import statement is the main cause for this error. do I have to import someother things like <code>from __future__ import ...*</code>)</p>

<p>PS: if you have any suggestion related to structure then most welcome but I'm more concerned about this error.</p>

<p>when i set degree = 90 the value for radian will be 1.5707...</p>

<p><code>UnitType</code> is an enum with Degree and Radian. is <code>unit = unittype.degree</code> degree will be used when serialized and when <code>unit = unittype.radian</code> radain will be used when serialized. </p>

<p>the code i use to select what representation i use is as following:</p>

<p>Adding 'src=""../public/lib/clientEncryption.jar""' to the  tag results in the proper request to the server, ""/public/lib/clientEncryption.jar"" but that still results in a routing error.In any case I don't know if the jar would be used after being downloaded.The server shows 4 attempts to get the jar followed by 2 attempts to get the class file.</p>

<p>""Input"" here is simply an input field which is in a class (<code>var inputElement = this.input;</code>). The problem is that both ""setSelectionRange"" and ""createTextRange"". Am I doing something wrong? Is createTextRange defined only for TextArea?</p>

<p>@Edit: well it appears I was using something like ""two objects"" a js input and a jquery input, after changing input to document.getElementsByTagName(""input"")[0]; I am able to go to ""createTextRange"" branch but it still doesn't change the position of the cursor.</p>

<p>@Edit2: I changed the code a bit, now I'm getting the input from the document and it enters the if branch. But then the browser shows me:</p>

<pre><code>Unexpected call to method or property access.
</code></pre>

<p>On this line <code>var range = input.createTextRange();</code></p>

<p>@Edit3: To answer James' question. I have a class and in that class, the whole thing is associated with a jsp which has an input. In this class I set a focus handler for the field which is associated with the input form the jsp <code>inputElement.focus(onInputFocus)</code> then I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function onInputFocus() {
    isFocused = true;

    var input = document.getElementsByTagName(""input"")[0];

<p>My question is, does it make a difference if we wake up all threads on lock address vs. a single thread on lock address (after lock release)? And if we were to wake up a single thread, which one does it make sense to wake, the first to get put to sleep on lock address?</p>

<p>I can see some advantage of waking up one thread, in that if we wake up all, n-1 can potentially go back to sleep. But I don't know if there are disadvantages to waking up a single thread.</p>

I have found other work arounds such as unbinding the element. However, i can't do that or other workarounds for various reasons, as it will affect my other code.

<p>But custom options in the object Icon will not be transmitted, as well as marker.</p>

<pre><code>jQuery.getJSON(url, function (json) {

        jQuery.each(json, function(i, entry){
            var _id = entry.event_id;
            var _point = new google.maps.LatLng(entry.options.lat,entry.options.lng);

            jQuery.each(EMarkers, function(idx, data){
                if (data.nameIco == entry.options.icon){ 
                    entry.options.icon = data;
                }           
            });


            createMarker( _point, entry.options);

        });

});

 function createMarker(point, options){
        var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
            position: point, 
            map: map,
            icon: options.icon,

            id: options.id
        });
    }

<p>The problem is that I can not get to using JSON icons for marker only as a string, and the only way I can see to get the objects created from an array, but how to get out of it the desired value?</p>

<p>As you will see the bottom 2 boxes act as normal but the top two boxes are stuck together even though the css for the margins have been set to prevent this. It's possibly an easy fix but after banging my head off this all last night I feel like giving up.</p>

<p>As you can see I am using the same method for POST and PUT the only difference is the InitializeRequest method which sets the _Request.Method property differently.</p>

<p>The data that I am trying to post contains this string <strong>æøåÆØÅ</strong> which gets transmitted properly for PUT request but gets messed up on POST.</p>

<p>My gut feeling is that the .Net framework handles these in different ways but I have no way to confirm that.</p>

<p>I cannot figure out how there can be a problem. the <code>flag</code> can either true or false so only one of the <code>producer</code> or <code>consumer</code> will get into the <code>if</code> statement. After one of them enters the <code>if</code> it will enter the monitor with object <code>r</code> (both are initialized with the same object reference). The only problem which can happen that the <code>r</code> object being modified by the <code>increment_decrement ()</code> function call, and the <code>get_flag ()</code> reading the flag at the same time, but even then it will not enter the <code>if</code> in that iteration, but it will enter the <code>if</code> block on the next iteration, and even if the first thread did not leave the monitor, it will wait there for it (before the <code>synchronized</code> block).</p>

<p>The Arraycopy function call does ""move"" parts the content of the value character array to make space for the later injected str content (str.getChars(value, start)). From my point of view, one should only do this arraycopy if the str length does not match the space to be overwritten in the character array anyways.</p>

<p>Clearly one is <em>very</em> desperate to consider this a performance issue, though making tests with bigger character arrays (>500k chars) and arraycopy in a StringBuilder replacement class leaded to measurable performance improvement.</p>

<p>1) {""The element 'Document' has invalid child element 'Metadata2'. List of possible elements expected: 'Page'.""}</p>

<p>I think its because it is reading in sequence whereas in my case those elements can appear in any order. I tried doing the xs:all attribute but it doesn't work with maxoccurs=unbounded. Any other way ?</p>

<p>2) {""The element 'Frame' has invalid child element 'Leaf'. List of possible elements expected: 'Frame'.""}</p>

<p>I am using GET requests to send/recieve data from the server. Up until I implemented the last GET request the code was working fine. Now i have <code>PHP Notice:  Undefined index: role</code> in my error log and I cannot work out why.</p>

<p>Here is the PHP server-side code.</p>

<pre><code>$handler = new XMLHandler();
if ($_GET[""ajax""] == ""true"") {#fn - Function
    if($_GET[""fn""] == ""init""){
    }elseif($_GET[""fn""] == ""cou""){
        echo $handler-&gt;toJSON($handler-&gt;getCourses());
    }elseif($_GET[""fn""] == ""mod""){
        echo $handler-&gt;toJSON($handler-&gt;getModules($_GET[""data""]));
    }elseif($_GET[""fn""] == ""filt""){
        $breakdown = explode("":"", $_GET[""role""]);//breakdown the roleString from the client side into an Array
        echo $handler-&gt;toJSON($handler-&gt;getCoursesByRole($breakdown[1]));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the JQuery AJAX call</p>

<pre><code>var data = {
  ""fn"" : ""filt"",
  ""ajax"" : ""true"",
  ""role"" : roleString
};
$.ajax({
  type: ""GET"",
  url: SERVICE_URL, //Relative or absolute path to response.php file
  data: data,
  contentType: ""application/json"",
  success: function(response) {
    console.log(response);
    var i, list = """";
        for (i = 0; i &lt; response.length; i++) {
            console.log(response[i]);
            list += formatListItem(response[i]);
        }
        $(""#cList"").html(list).listview('refresh');
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p><code>roleString</code> looks like this: <code>core:false:false</code></p>

<p>If anybody can offer any advice or help I would really appreciate it.</p>

<p>a var_dump of $_GET gives me this:</p>

<pre><code>array(3) {
  [""fn""]=&gt;
  string(4) ""filt""
  [""ajax""]=&gt;
  string(4) ""true""
  [""role""]=&gt;
  string(34) ""adultScotland:projectM:false:false""
}

It would work fine if all the update locations were the same but they are not, the customer would choose where the files go, either to a web site or file share.

<p>What i want to achieve is the same thing with SVG, but without messing about with creating a load of PNGs, so that when the user mouses over an area the transparent shape (with link on it) appears over the top. The SVG shape would be built from a set of coordinates exactly as a polygonal hotspot would on an image map.</p>

<p>So i guess my first question is, can this be done with plain old SVG or do i need to use something like Raphael to achieve this? Never seen this effect before with SVG so if anyone has an example like that would be very useful.</p>

Then open a new tab in the same browser, and then you can see your name (get from the session) on the new tab. Be careful with the browser-cache, sometimes seems that it doesn't happen but it's for the cache, refresh the second tab.</p>

Currently, I have a struct Game that has the current state of the game (Main Menu, Pause Menu, Playing etc), the turn, 3 integers that work as booleans, pointer to a board and pointer to the selected piece:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct game{
    ChessBoard *board;
    ChessPiece *selectedPiece;

    ChessColor turn;
    State state;

    //Booleans
    int inGame;
    int checkmate;
    int check;
}Game;
</code></pre>

<p>The Board has a 2D array of pointers to pieces, the players and the last moved pieces (for en passant):</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct chessboard{
    ChessPiece *pieces[8][8];

    Player *player1;
    Player *player2;

    ChessPiece *lastMovedBlackPiece;
    ChessPiece *lastMovedWhitePiece;
} ChessBoard;
</code></pre>

<p>And finally the piece:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct chesspiece{
    //Properties
    int x;
    int y;
    ChessColor color;

    //Type
    Type type;

    int numberOfMoves;
} ChessPiece;
</code></pre>

<p>Each time the player selects a piece, the program calculates and shows the valid moves of the selected piece, and after moving a piece the program verifies whether the enemy king is in check or it was checkmate by checking the possible moves of the pieces (if a piece can protect him, if the king can move elsewhere).</p>

<p>I see people creating lists for valid moves instead of calculating every time, but I'd have to create a list for every piece and calculate all the possible moves for a player when the turn changes? Would that improve the performance? I also saw the board being just an array, would that have greater performance as well?</p>

<p>Basically, which are the possible optimizations I can do in my code for better performance?</p>

<p>My original idea was to hand each thread a BitmapData returned by Bitmap.LockBits with a different rectangle for each thread. This however throws a ""System.InvalidOperationException: Bitmap region is already locked."", even though there are no overlapping regions. </p>

<p>A small code example, single threaded but it proves my point:</p>

<pre><code>{
     Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap(16, 8, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppRgb);
     var data1 = bmp.LockBits(new System.Drawing.Rectangle(0, 0, 8, 8), System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageLockMode.WriteOnly, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppRgb);

}

<p>In this code example, the last statement throws an exception. Unless my count is off, both rectangles should be contained in the original bitmap and should not overlap. </p>

<p>Should I lock the entire image with one LockBits and then write to that BitmapData from without concern for thread safety? I copy my data into the Bitmap using a Marshal.Copy(). </p>

<p>I am trying to write a recursive function that can find the steps to craft any minecraft item from a flatfile of minecraft recipes. This one has me really stumped.</p>

<p>The flatfile is kinda long so I included it in <a href=""https://gist.github.com/1989842"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> gist.</p>

<pre><code>def getRecipeChain(item, quantity=1):
    #magic recursive stuffs go here
</code></pre>

<p>So basically I need to look up the first recipe then look up the recipes for all the components of that first recipe and so on till you get to items with no recipes. Each time I need to append the recipe to a list so I get a sort of instruction set of what order to craft items in.</p>

<p>So here is the function I have now(the one the does not work)</p>

<pre><code>def getRecipeChain(name, quantity=1):
    chain = []

    def getRecipe(name1, quantity1=1):
        if name1 in recipes:
            for item in recipes[name1][""ingredients""][""input""]:
                if item in recipes:
                    getRecipe(item, quantity1)
                else:
                    chain.append(item)

    getRecipe(name, quantity)
    return chain
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the ideal output I am going for. It is a dictionary with the item name and quantity's stored in it.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; getRecipeChain(""solar_panel"", 1):
{""insulated_copper_cable"":13, ""electronic_circuit"":2, ""re_battery"":1, ""furnace"":1, ""machine"":1, ""generator"":1, ""solar_panel"":1}
</code></pre>

<p>So the question is, how do I do it?</p>

<p>I know asking for people to do work for you is frowned up here, so if you feel this is a little too close to you just doing the coding for me, just say so.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>The goal with that $sql is to get the last id from last car inserted on row cars and add 1 extra to him passed by the check box.</p>

<p>i have tried just with 1 box because i read that if a checkbox was unchecked pass ""null""argument.</p>

<p>I tried already with diferent aproaches. My final goal is create a for cicle that creates the number of rows in table extra for each number of extra checked in my checkbox.</p>

<p>(i tried something like this but with no sucess)</p>

<pre><code>$checkbox1 = $_POST['chk'];
if($_POST[""Submit""]==""Submit""){

    for ($i=0;$i&lt;sizeof ($checkbox1)$i++){
    $sql = ""INSERT INTO extra (id_lista_extra)     values('"".$checkbox1[$i].""')"";   
    mysql_query($sql) or die(mysql_error());
   }
}

ServiceB implementing IServiceX </p>

<p>Technically i am new to this site, however i have been using it as a resource for a few years, and it is only because i am stumped that i now come in need of your aid.</p>

<p>I have a VB script that is Querying the Db, filling the intended boxes with the string and displaying it.</p>

<p>My issue is that when i try to use the Update SQL command, it completes however it does not update the DB when i manually check.</p>

<pre><code>Dim con As OleDbConnection = New OleDbConnection(""Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source='C:\Data.mdb';"")
Dim da As New OleDbDataAdapter
Dim dt As New DataTable()
Dim cmd As New OleDbCommand
da.SelectCommand = New OleDbCommand(""update FDSL set Host=@Host, Owner=@Owner where ID = @ID"", con)


    Dim paramID As New OleDbParameter
    paramID.ParameterName() = ""@ID""
    paramID.Value() = Label8.Text
    da.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add(paramID)
    Dim paramHost As New OleDbParameter
    paramHost.ParameterName() = ""@Host""
    paramHost.Value() = TextBox1.Text
    da.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add(paramHost)
    Dim paramOwn As New OleDbParameter
    paramOwn.ParameterName() = ""@Owner""
    paramOwn.Value() = TextBox4.Text

    da.SelectCommand.ExecuteNonQuery()

    MessageBox.Show(""Record Updated! "", ""Update Status"", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information)

    Refresh()
    con.Close()
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried the params using the .tostring on the end as well, but this does not work either.</p>

<p>----------Solved----------------</p>

<p>I must thank @Gord Thompson for this assistance, however i solved the issue by recoding it.</p>

<pre><code>        Dim str As String
    str = ""update FDSL set Hostname=@Hostname, Owner=@Owner where ID=@id""
    Dim cmd As New OleDbCommand(str, con)
    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@Hostname"", TextBox1.Text)
    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@Owner"", TextBox2.Text)
    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@ID"", textbox6.Text)
    con.Open()
    cmd.ExecuteNonQuery()
    con.Close()
</code></pre>

<p>This now works correctly thank your for helping again!</p>

<p>Basically i want to have a directory with a number of plugin dll's that get loaded at runtime. All the plugins in the dlls will implement 2+ interfaces.  The first interface will be IPlugin and will contain methods to intilalise the plugin and stop it. The rest of the interfaces will be interfaces for features that plugin supplies/implements. When i need something that implements 1 of those interfaces i ask ninject/plugin manager for the instance of all the plugins that implement that feature/interface so i can call them. The other catch is i need as single instance of each plugin to be loaded and returned so if a plugin implements 3 interfaces/features the single instance would be returned when ever i ask for any of those features/interfaces.</p>

<p>Lastly i need this all done dynamically as in with no config xml file or hardcoded mappings. Also if possible i would love to use ninject to populate the constructor properties if possible but if that is too hard i can do that via methods on the IPlugin interface.</p>

<p>I know this is more than a little complicated but i am hoping someone can help me out or at least point me in the right direction. I have looked at most of the other posts on plugin systems but they are based on a common interface.  In my case the common interface is for setup only and the rest of the interfaces are different so none of them seem to match.  Also if possible i didn't want the plugins to reference ninject in any way if possible.</p>

<p>So far i have tried the following and it seems to work so i just need to do some dependencies between plugins now</p>

<pre><code>public class PluginManager:IDisposable
{
    IKernel kernel;

    public PluginManager()
    {
        kernel = new StandardKernel();

        kernel.Bind(
               x =&gt; x.FromThisAssembly()
                     .SelectAllClasses().InheritedFrom&lt;IPlugin&gt;()
                     .BindAllInterfaces()
                     .Configure(c =&gt;c.InSingletonScope()));


    }

    public T GetPluginInstance&lt;T&gt;()
    {
        return kernel.Get&lt;T&gt;();
    }

    public IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; GetAllPluginInstances&lt;T&gt;()
    {
        return kernel.GetAll&lt;T&gt;();
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        kernel.Dispose();
    }
}

<p>Consider the following Python program:</p>

<pre><code>import random

class B:
    def __init__(self):
        self.attr=random.randrange(0,10)

class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.b=B()

list=[]
print ""First pass""
for i in range(0,10):
    a=A()
    print ""Random number in b: "",a.b.attr
    list.insert(0,a)

print ""Second pass""
for l in list:
    print ""Random number in b: "",a.b.attr
</code></pre>

<p>It typically outputs something such as:</p>

<pre><code>First pass
Random number in b:  9
Random number in b:  7
Random number in b:  1
Random number in b:  5
Random number in b:  9
Random number in b:  7
Random number in b:  0
Random number in b:  6
Random number in b:  2
Random number in b:  7

Second pass
Random number in b:  7
Random number in b:  7
Random number in b:  7
Random number in b:  7
Random number in b:  7
Random number in b:  7
Random number in b:  7
Random number in b:  7
Random number in b:  7
Random number in b:  7
</code></pre>

<p>How do we solve this? I know it has to do with how Python copies object etc., but having:</p>

<pre><code>import copy
list.insert(0,copy.deepcopy(a))
</code></pre>

<p>Doesn't solve it as one could expect.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.phonegap.com/start/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phonegap.com/start/</a></p>

<p>But when I try to compile the project, the Compiler throws 2 errors:</p>

<p>It strictly followed the guide and googled the errors, but I couldn't find any good information about this problem or figure it out, as I don't know the SDK, Phonegap or Xcode in special. To me it looks like some basic filelink would be missing or something, but I couldn't find any information on this error in particular too, so I have no idea how to fix this. </p>

For clarity, let us assume all observed variables (Yti) are categorical, where each Yti conveys different information and as such may have different cardinalities. 
An illustrative example is given in the figure below, where M=3.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/TTbVo.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>My goal is to train the transition,emission and prior probabilities of an HMM, using the Baum-Welch algorithm, from my observed variable sequences (Yti). Let's say, Xt will initially have 2 hidden states.</p>

<p>I have read a few tutorials (including the famous Rabiner paper) and went through the codes of a few HMM software packages, namely '<strong>HMM Toolbox in MatLab</strong>' and '<strong>hmmpytk package in Python</strong>'. Overall, I did an extensive web search and all the resources -that I could find- only cover the case, where there is only a single observed variable (M=1) at each time point. This increasingly makes me think HMM's are not suitable for situations with multiple observed variables.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it possible to model the problem depicted in the figure as an HMM? </li>
<li>If it is, how can one modify the Baum-Welch algorithm to cater for training the HMM parameters based on the multi-variable observation (emission) probabilities?</li>
<li>If not, do you know of a methodology that is more suitable for the situation depicted in the figure?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
In this <a href=""http://www.revistas.unam.mx/index.php/jart/article/view/25279"" rel=""nofollow"">paper</a>, the situation depicted in the figure is described as a Dynamic Naive Bayes, which -in terms of the training and estimation algorithms- requires a slight extension to Baum-Welch and Viterbi algorithms for a single-variable HMM.</p>

<p>I know it will block the Update function until sent, but it is not important right now to me, since I am just trying to get a frame transmitted to understand how this new system works, and proceed from there.

<p>I have also tried to use a 1024 buffer, and it only takes longer to show the message (after more than 100 successfully sent packages).</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/no-free-events-for-message-what-does-this-mean.332053/"" rel=""nofollow"">this thread</a>, it is related to messages being sent too fast and filling the queue, but none of the proposed solutions worked for me.
I would appreciate any help or orientation, since Unity documentation is really poor.</p>

    if (move !== false) base.$wrapper.scrollLeft(base.singleWidth * page);

        // Update local variable
        base.currentPage = page;

Some of them are installed to the GAC, some of them are just included from a ""lib"" folder. I need to build one of my projects (specifically a WinForms app) to able to run on any, non-development computers without any installation process (except for the .NET runtime of course), just as portable apps do.</p>

<p>For this to work, I need to have all of the referenced DLLs and their whole dependency tree in the output folder of my EXE. I can do it for exemple by marking the dependencies to ""Copy local"" in the properties window, but that works only for the direct references of the EXE project, so it's far not enough. Another way is to make a setup project, but my client and also I want to avoid that (in the final version I'm gonna use ClickOnce). Of course I can always do it purely by hand, gathering all the DLLs manually, but that's quite a nightmare.</p>

<p>Is there some tool, msbuild trick, command-line option, whatever hack to force Visual Studio to gather the whole dependency tree of my EXE during build, and copy them to the output folder? So that I could just ZIP everything together and send to my client.</p>

<p>So now I just want to make sure nobody can get into the admin section of my site by sending me an email with a temporary (active for only about 5-10 minutes) code to my private Yahoo or Google email address (hidden in a PHP file), that both <em>already</em> implement SMS two-step authentication, every time I get my username and password correct at the admin login page. </p>

<p>And what I would like to do instead is to store this information in SQL somewhere so that we can manipulate the information more easily. But we want to keep the same functionality that having the information in web.config provides, just like we can use a SqlRoleProvider instead of hardcoding roles in the app. So in other words, if a user currently tries to goto ""somePath"" and they're not a member of ""approvedRoles"" then they get redirected back to default.aspx, and if they are a member of ""approvedRoles"" then they get the page. I want to do the same thing, but without using web.config as the authorization mechanism.</p>

<p>So what I'm NOT asking is how do I go about defining roles, or how do I handle logging in to the database, but specifically how do I store the above information in SQL instead of web.config. Actually, I'll take ""anywhere but web.config"" for now.</p>

<p>For that matter, has this question already been asked on SO and I've missed it? What would you google?</p>

<p>My code works fine with single images and still for a stream of images at about 1 FPS.
Above 2 FPS my application crashes with Xorg errors, so I think my cairo mechanic is wrong.</p>

<p>It looks kind of like this:</p>

<pre><code>class A {
    B toB() {...}
    static A fromB(B b) {...}
}
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>class B {
    void save(File f) {...}
    static B load(File f) {...}
}
</code></pre>

<p>I used to think it's a good and simple approach, but lately the static-ness of the conversion-from method has been annoying me, for instance if I want to define an interface for types that can be converted to- and from- <code>B</code>:</p>

<pre><code>interface ConvertableToAndFromB {
    B toB();
    // ?
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, is there an elegant way of doing that without having the conversion-from as static, other than migrating to Smalltalk?</p>

<h3>EDIT</h3>

<p>To clarify, I realize I <em>can</em> add a non-static method in the interface, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>interface ConvertableToAndFromB {
    B toB();
    void fromB(B b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>or, if I want to allow immutable types (thanks Stripling):</p>

<pre><code>interface ConvertableToAndFromB&lt;T implements ConvertibleToAndFromB&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
    B toB();
    T fromB(B b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that will require me to create a new <code>A</code> before I can even invoke this, as in:</p>

<pre><code>A a = new A();
a.fromB(b);
</code></pre>

<p>or (for immutable):</p>

<pre><code>A a = new A();
a = a.fromB(b);
</code></pre>

<p>which is what I'm trying to avoid (but will do with no other solution). I just hope there's a nicer way.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be as straight forward when driving out the main application entry point in ""bin/my_application.rb"".  The main issue for me is that I'm not describing a class in RSpec, it's a sequential Ruby script for managing the application's classes and initialization via command line parameters and options.</p>

<p>""bin/my_application.rb"" is just a small shell-executed wrapper for parsing command line options and passing them onto my main application class as initializer options.  I'd still like to test the behavior of the bin script (e.g. MyApp.should_receive(option_a).with(parameter)).</p>

<p>I wish to accomplish the following with a Macro:</p>

<ol>
<li>I would like to keep column A as it is.</li>
<li>Create a column B for Deliverables, which need to be extracted from cells in Col A </li>
<li>Likewise, create a column C for Work Products, which need to be extracted from cells in Col A </li>
</ol>

<p>Let me give an example:</p>

<p>Supposing Cell A1 contains</p>

<pre>DEL1: DEL 1 Project Process, DEL2: DEL 2 Project Schedule, WKP1: WKP 1 Work Product Document</pre>

<p>Here's what I want Cell B1 to look like:</p>

<pre>DEL1: DEL 1 Project Process, DEL2: DEL 2 Project Schedule</pre>

<p>And Cell C1 to look like this:</p>

<pre>WKP1: WKP1 Work Product Document</pre>

<p>And mind you, not all the cells in Col A will be the exact character length as Cell A1. But they will contain both DELs and WKPs. </p>

<p>Given that the names of the Deliverables and Work Products vary in length, I cannot simply copy Col A and run TextToColumn in order to split it. </p>

<p>So far, the approach I have come up with is to copy Col A to Col B, retain the Deliverables and try to remove Work Products. </p>

<p>As you can see, this entails deleting the part of the string that starts with the comma ("","") and space ("" "") in front of ""WKP"" and ends with the last character of the Work Product in question (which in this case would be the last character of the entire string itself since it seems that the WKPs are mentioned right after DELs). </p>

<p>While I am able to write a Macro the can find the text ""WKP"" within each cell range and delete it, I am not able to delete the stuff that comes right after it. In other words, I am only able to produce this for Cell B1: </p>

<pre>DEL1: DEL 1 Project Process, DEL2: DEL 2 Project Schedule, 1: 1 Work Product Document</pre>

<p>Can someone help me write the Macro to do this? I would appreciate it if the syntax was also explained. </p>

"21850995","1","25966630","","2014-02-18 10:31:57","","2","774","<p>I'm relatively new to Rails. I would like to add an association to a model that uses the polymorphic association, but returns only models of a particular type, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>class Note &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  # The true polymorphic association
  belongs_to :subject, polymorphic: true

  # Same as subject but where subject_type is 'Volunteer'
  belongs_to :volunteer, source_association: :subject
  # Same as subject but where subject_type is 'Participation'
  belongs_to :participation, source_association: :subject
end
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried a vast array of combinations from reading about the associations on ApiDock but nothing seems to do exactly what I want. Here's the best I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>class Note &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :subject, polymorphic: true
  belongs_to :volunteer, class_name: ""Volunteer"", foreign_key: :subject_id, conditions: {notes: {subject_type: ""Volunteer""}}
  belongs_to :participation, class_name: ""Participation"", foreign_key: :subject_id, conditions: {notes: {subject_type: ""Participation""}}
end
</code></pre>

<p>And I want it to pass this test:</p>

<pre><code>describe Note do
  context 'on volunteer' do
    let!(:volunteer) { create(:volunteer) }
    let!(:note) { create(:note, subject: volunteer) }
    let!(:unrelated_note) { create(:note) }

    it 'narrows note scope to volunteer' do
      scoped = Note.scoped
      scoped = scoped.joins(:volunteer).where(volunteers: {id: volunteer.id})
      expect(scoped.count).to be 1
      expect(scoped.first.id).to eq note.id
    end

    it 'allows access to the volunteer' do
      expect(note.volunteer).to eq volunteer
    end

    it 'does not return participation' do
      expect(note.participation).to be_nil
    end

  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The first test passes, but you can't call the relation directly:</p>

<pre><code>  1) Note on volunteer allows access to the volunteer
     Failure/Error: expect(note.reload.volunteer).to eq volunteer
     ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid:
       PG::Error: ERROR:  missing FROM-clause entry for table ""notes""
       LINE 1: ....""deleted"" = 'f' AND ""volunteers"".""id"" = 7798 AND ""notes"".""s...
                                                                    ^
       : SELECT  ""volunteers"".* FROM ""volunteers""  WHERE ""volunteers"".""deleted"" = 'f' AND ""volunteers"".""id"" = 7798 AND ""notes"".""subject_type"" = 'Volunteer' LIMIT 1
     # ./spec/models/note_spec.rb:10:in `block (3 levels) in &lt;top (required)&gt;'
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>The reason I want to do it this way is because I'm constructing a scope based on parsing a query string including joining to various models/etc; the code used to construct the scope is considerably more complex than that above - it uses <code>collection.reflections</code>, etc. My current solution works for this, but it offends me I can't call the relations directly from an instance of Note.</p>

<p>I could solve it by splitting it into two issues: using scopes directly</p>

<pre><code>  scope :scoped_by_volunteer_id, lambda { |volunteer_id| where({subject_type: 'Volunteer', subject_id: volunteer_id}) }
  scope :scoped_by_participation_id, lambda { |participation_id| where({subject_type: 'Participation', subject_id: participation_id}) }
</code></pre>

<p>and then just using a getter for <code>note.volunteer</code>/<code>note.participation</code> that just returns <code>note.subject</code> if it has the right <code>subject_type</code> (nil otherwise) but I figured in Rails there must be a better way?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when I return valRet2 from chart_data, I get the required array in the index.js.erb file. But if I try returning valRet1, I get errors.</p>

<p>I played around with ActiveSupport::JSON.encode, jQuery.parseJSON, converting my JSON object to string and escaping quotes etc. Nothing seems to work.</p>

<p>The following resulted in errors:</p>

<pre><code>return '[[""Sep 9, 1970"", 0],
        [""Sep 14, 1970"", 0.94],
        [""Sep 20, 1970"", 0.46]]'
</code></pre>

<p>The following also resulted in errors:</p>

<pre><code>result = [['Sep 9, 1970', 0],
          ['Sep 14, 1970', 0.94],
          ['Sep 20, 1970', 0.46]]
return '""' + ActiveSupport::JSON.encode(result) + '""'
</code></pre>

<p>The following returned correctly:</p>

<pre><code>return ""[['Sep 9, 1970', 0],
        ['Sep 14, 1970', 0.94],
        ['Sep 20, 1970', 0.46]]""
</code></pre>

<p>The array (preferably hash) needs to be made on the fly (taking values from database) and hence cannot be a literal as in the case of correctly returned data above.</p>

<p>Help will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Environment:</p>

<pre><code>OS: Windows 7
Rails: 3.1.0
Ruby: 1.9.2p290 (2011-07-09) [i386-mingw32]

def move_around():
    for x in list(petri_dish):
        x.age += 1
        if x.status == 0 or (x.species == 'species' and x.age &gt;= 750) or (x.species == 'predator' and x.age &gt;= 3000):
            print str(x.name) + ' expired. Cells left: ' + str(len(petri_dish))

<p>The Offspring class is a <code>simple</code> species and should die at age 750 or above - ideally at 750 exactly, but that's part of the problem. I haven't figured out how to iterate over my list of objects (the <code>petri_dish</code>) and, at any point in the iteration, remove certain objects, whether they're at <code>status = 0</code> (dead) or have aged sufficiently.</p>

<p>Sorry if this is a simplistic question, but loops aren't my strong suit... I've been reading up on comprehensions and the like, but any additional material would be appreciated as well. Not to mention an answer to my question! Thanks much.</p>

At the moment, it is evaluating an if statement every time the image is moving, but I would like it to check it once the user has lifted their finger off the screen. How would I go about this?  I thought maybe using touchesEnded:withEvent but it didn't look like it was being called when lifting the finger.<br>
My code is a little complicated (well, it looks that way to me!) but if that is helpful, I will post it.  Basically, in the handlePanGesture method, it is checking the co-ordinates against a dictionary and if it is true, will 'snap' to the correct position.  The reason I want to check when the user has lifted is because, if they have dropped it in the wrong place, I'd like to animate it back to the original position.<br>

<p>Artifacts are docs (HTML/pdf/chm/...), libs (.dll/.so/.a/.jar/...), programs (.exe/.jar/...) and anything else. They are not restricted to Java/.NET and can come from different cultures (firmware, driver, mobile/workstation, GUI, Win/Linux/Mac/Solaris/AIX,... etc).</p>

<p>To orginize hierarhy we use such paths:</p>

<pre>
ftp://3pp/VENDOR/PRODUCT/VERSION/...
ftp://3pp/opensource/PACKAGE-x.x.x.tar.bz2
ftp://dist/PRODUCT/VERSION/...
</pre>

<p>To maintain description of artifacts we use <strong>README</strong> and <strong>CHANGES</strong> plain test files (reStructuredText).</p>

<p>What is missing in this schema?</p>

<ul>
<li>Missing permissions (anyone can damage storage).</li>
<li>Missing dependency tracking (so <em>every</em> build file must be updated if version dependency changed).</li>
<li>Missing fetching activity (some files seem no longer needed, but we don't know which).</li>
</ul>

<p>I am not deeply looking for existing solutions. Some package manager like rpm/dpkg, heard about Maven repo etc...</p>

<p>Please recommend Build Artifact Repository Managers. Also it is good to hear drawbacks and restrictions.</p>

In .NET, it appears that you have to give the <code>System.Net.Mail.Message</code> object an HTML string for the content and then somehow embed the required images. Is there an easy way to do this in .NET? I'm pretty new to .NET MVC and would most appreciate any help.</p>

<p>This is how it looks in ASP Classic:</p>

<p>a) There is an enumeration called 'section type' which can be 'view' (in this case, another property called 'content' contains the path/filename of a file to read in).  Or it can be 'text' where the 'content' property text is itself placed in the document.  </p>

<p>b) There is another enumeration called 'Action' which can be of type 'append', 'prepend' or 'replacebytag'.  In the last case, another property becomes relevant, called 'tagtoreplace'.  If we are appending/prepending, this tagtoreplace property can be empty.</p>

<p>What is the best practice way to represent such interdependencies?  There are several ways I can think of, none of which reek with beauty:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When the method to 'generate the document' is called, go through the properties to ensure they conform to this logic.</p></li>
<li><p>Put checks in the get/set methods.  One issue with this is that when I set my section type to 'view' I may not set my 'content' property until a line or so afterwards - so you can't reject the request to set it at that point.</p></li>
<li><p>Use separate properties somehow to partition the uses - eg 'content' in my first example above shouldn't be used for a filepath in one case and a bunch of HTML content in another.  This doesn't smell right to me, but having separate properties for each seems excessive.</p></li>
<li><p>Inherit subclasses, each with different sets of the additional needed properties.  Since there can be various combinations of section type and action type, I can't think of an elegant way to bake all this logic into such a structure.  But I'm no OOP guru!</p></li>

<p>Any thoughts on the best approach?</p>

    case 'paypal':
        $('#costLabel').text('14.99');
        break;
    default:
        $('#costLabel').text('select your choice');
    }
});

&lt;/script&gt;

<li><p>Lets say I have a really heavy piece of computation, it involves two nested for loops goings over an array of size 1000*1000</p></li>

<p>this will defer the function call to until all the other on-click,on-scroll,etc events are cleared.
however as the calculation takes 1 Minute, the user might trigger some event during that time. 
do you think if I just do the following I will prevent JavaScript from hanging. Assuming that heavyComputation
takes about 0.06 millisecond to computate.</p>

<pre><code># _.map is from underscore@ library, basically does a for loop
# HeavyComputation is a slow function with lots of operations made for my app

NonBlockMap = (x,f)-&gt; setTimeout (-&gt;_.map x,f),0

NonBlockHeavyComputation = (x) -&gt; setTimeout (-&gt; HeavyComputation(x)),0

TwoForLoops = (ArrayOfArray) -&gt;

   SecondLoop = (element) -&gt; NonBlockHeavyComputation element

   FirstLoop = (array) -&gt; NonBlockMap array, SecondLoop


   return NonBlockMap ArrayOfArray,FirstLoop

Use the <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/ksoap2-android/"" rel=""nofollow"">kSoap-Android</a> library as it automates pretty much everything and has little to no bugs like this.</p>

<p>I'm creating an android application where you can quicly check your timeroster for the classes in the next week. To do this, I use 2 servers: </p>

<ul>
<li>The server that hosts the timerosters for every student in HTML form
(I do not manage this server) </li>
<li>The server that hosts my webservice (which I manage). It's a .NET webservice and is finished.</li>
</ul>

<h2><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Rb4p.png"" alt=""Visualisation:""></h2>

<p>The android device connects to the Webservice-server and sends the function ""login"" with parameters ""username"": ""usernameX"" and ""password"": ""passwordX"".</p>

<p>The webservice-server then retrieves the login-page from the timeroster-server with the ""username"" and ""password"" fields as post parameters. The timeroster-server will respond with a html-page, that will be parsed by the webservice-server and depending on it's contents, the webservice will respond to the Android device with either ""Success"" or ""AuthenticationFail"".</p>

<p>To do this, I use the SOAP-architecture on my Android Device, which sends a SOAP-enveloppe to the webservice. The webservice then creates HttpWebRequest- and HttpWebResponse-objects that retrieve the html-source from the timeroster-server.</p>

<p>This approach has worked for me so far using the Socket-class and I have been able to login to the timeroster-server, using my android device. However, the problem lies with another function.</p>

<p>My webservice supports 2 functions: ""login"" and ""GetList"". I can perfectly call the ""login""-function from my android and receive a ""Success""-string. But when I call the ""GetList""-function (that takes 3 parameters: a username, a password and a listType), it returns a 400 Bad Request. </p>

<p>When I send the exact same http-request to the webservice-server with <a href=""http://www.telerik.com/fiddler"" rel=""nofollow"">Fiddler</a>, I don't receive a 400 Bad Request error.</p>

<p>Why am I getting a 400 error ONLY when I use my android-device? Is there any way I can fix this?</p>

<p>I have a loop in a function in Javascript that gets the coordinates and name a location from an XML file, and creates markers on a custom made google map. I want these markers to be clickable and pop up an info window. I have the code written for it, and all the markers show up fine on the map. But when I click on any marker, only one info window appears on the first marker that was created. Here's what I did...</p>

<pre><code>for(var i=0; i&lt;items.length; i++) {
        var latitude = items[i].getElementsByTagName('Lat')[0].childNodes[0].nodeValue;
        var longitude = items[i].getElementsByTagName('Lon')[0].childNodes[0].nodeValue;
        var latlng = new google.maps.LatLng(latitude,longitude);
        var titleNode = items[i].getElementsByTagName('Name')[0].childNodes[0];
        var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
                position: latlng,
                map: map,
                title: titleNode.nodeValue,
                icon: orangeCircle
        });

        var infoWindow = new google.maps.InfoWindow({
                content: 'Hello world'
        });

        google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'click', function() {
                infoWindow.open(map, marker);
        });
}
</code></pre>

<p>My guess (and it's really only a guess, I'm new to javascript) is that I need to create a new marker name for each marker. As in, each one shouldn't just be named ""marker"". I was thinking the easiest way to fix it was to create a variable name based on what iteration the loop was on, so marker1, marker2, marker3, etc. But I'm not sure how I could set the variable name to add a number to the end of it based on whatever iteration we're on.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Is there any other way I could go about doing it if it's wrong? Thanks!!</p>

<p>What i see the problem is when i click on the section1 at the first time, everything is going okay, but when i change to the section2 weird things are coming...</p>

<p>and ow ya, i only took a CSS and HTML for it, i'm trying to make it work like jQuery or javascript(""when you going to section1, the section1 will ease in and the other section ease out. Otherwise when you go to the section2, the other section will ease out and section2 will ease in"")</p>

<p>I managed to implement these in the tableview, and it works fine. Then I add a refresh button on the navigation bar, so if someone press the refresh button, the app will fetch data from web again and reload the tableview with the new data. </p>

<p>Here comes the problem, when I refresh the data and call the method reloaddata, all table cells in both section get refreshed, I mean, the map is re-loaded and animated zoom in from world map to the interest region every time I press the refresh button. But I only want re-plot the annotations based on the refreshed data, not the map.</p>

<p>I think the problem come from the call of

There are no search results for ""mygreatapp"" for them<br>
Old users who had the app installed on their devices, first uninstalled/ cleaned cache the old app<br>

""mygreatapp -  app for people"" instead of the new app below.<br>
""mygreatapp -  app for people :)""  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>In MVC, model is the layer which keeps domain logic, so data validation must be done in the model and not in view/controller code.</p></li>
<li><p>Specifically in my case, no client-side MVC framework is used to sync model between client and server</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In a standalone local application, the view could communicate with the model (directly or using controller as proxy depending on the MVC variant) and request data validation. </p>

<p>However, in the web, if you are not using a client-side MVC framework, the model and controller are in the server and the view is in the client, so the issue becomes a little more complex. I see 3 options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Break MVC pattern and do data validation directly in view </li>
<li>Break DRY principle, duplicate part of the model in the view and use it to do data validation</li>
<li>Move a part of the controller to the client. This client code will request data validation to the model in the server via AJAX.</li>
</ul>

<p>All options use Javascript.</p>

<p>Last option is the best regarding software engineering, but options 1 and 2 are better regarding UI responsiveness. What is the best option?</p>

<p>As you can see the patterns <strong>""GE|TE""</strong> and the <strong>""AC|V""</strong> are missing from these outputs. How do I change my regular expression accordingly maintaining backward compatibility.</p>

<p>The output that you see comes in a complete string and due to some operational limits I cannot use any other concept other than regex here to get my desired values. I know using split would be ideal here but I cannot.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The code does not produce the desired output. It becomes stuck after DUP2 and the rest of the output is redirected towards the file. But if i replace the <code>TreatClient(client, nr);</code> line with the function block the code works as it should. Why is this happening ? Another weird issue is that the message <code>[server]Waiting at port 2021...</code> is also printed in the file and not on the screen .</p>

<p>All seems to work ok apart from a rather nasty effect when clicking to scroll through the images in fancybox - see example <a href=""http://www.andyingle.com/bugs/isotope/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.andyingle.com/bugs/isotope/</a></p>

<p>Both work fine individually so I guess it's a conflict? Probably a z-index thing by the looks of it? I've tried other lightbox plugins (shadowbox) which work fine but fancybox is a little more elegant so would prefer to use that.</p>

<p>Any ideas what could be causing this and how to fix it?</p>

<p>Many, many thanks!! </p>

<p>As I am learning as I go I wrote this little piece of assembly to reference an unmapped location (0x1000000) - I am running this as privileged code with VM on:</p>

<pre><code>ori r20, r0, 0
ori r12, r0, 0x1000000
/* next line should break it */
sw  r20, r12, r0
</code></pre>

<p>(I.e., write the contents of <code>r20 == 0</code> out to the address formed by ORing <code>r12 == 0x1000000</code> and <code>r0 == 0 =&gt; 0x1000000</code> obviously.)</p>

<p>But instead of jumping to the exception vector, GDB reports ""Program received SIGSEV"" - what did I get wrong? I haven't got the enable hardware exceptions bit on in the MSR but the manual says you cannot mask these exceptions in any case so that shouldn't be the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Further information</strong> I cannot get any (eg, including misalignment exceptions) of the exception handling code to execute, (unless I explicitly call it), whether or not I am using the debugger. With the debugger off I get this output from OVPsim (NB I merely changed the test address - there is no significance in the difference between 0xA000000 and 0x100000 above):</p>

<pre><code>Processor Exception (PC_PRX) Processor 'platform/cpu0' 0x248: sw       r20, r12, r0
Processor Exception (PC_WPX) No write access at 0xa000000
</code></pre>

<p>This is all code being run in privileged mode, so I can see no overt reason for it not to call the handlers, <em>unless</em> I have not configured the Microblaze properly. I have these turned on:</p>

<pre><code>icmAddStringAttr(cpu1_attr, ""endian"", ""big"");
icmAddDoubleAttr(cpu1_attr, ""mips"", 100.000000);
icmAddStringAttr(cpu1_attr, ""variant"", ""V8_20"");
icmAddBoolAttr(cpu1_attr, ""verbose"", ""true"");
icmAddUns32Attr(cpu1_attr, ""C_PVR"", 2);
icmAddUns32Attr(cpu1_attr, ""C_USE_MMU"", 3);
icmAddStringAttr(cpu1_attr, ""C_USE_BARREL"", ""1"");
icmAddStringAttr(cpu1_attr, ""C_USE_DIV"", ""1"");
icmAddUns32Attr(cpu1_attr, ""C_USE_INTERRUPT"", 1);
icmAddUns32Attr(cpu1_attr, ""C_MMU_TLB_ACCESS"", 3);
icmAddUns32Attr(cpu1_attr, ""C_UNALIGNED_EXCEPTIONS"", 1);

icmAddUns32Attr(cpu1_attr, ""C_OPCODE_0x0_ILLEGAL"", 1);
icmAddUns32Attr(cpu1_attr, ""C_DEBUG_ENABLED"", 1);
</code></pre>

<p>There is no reason to believe this won't work as OVPsim will run Linux on the Microblaze.</p>

Most of it I can handle without the use of JS and still have a functioning site, however there is one bit that is eluding me. (note, I'm using ASP.NET MVC but that shouldn't matter in this instance)</p>

<p>I have an input field that is making great use of jQuery-UI AutoComplete.  The behavior is very simple. The user is asked to input their City, but is given an  AutoComplete list of valid cities.  If the city is invalid, the server side validation fires and tells them to try again.</p>

<p>If they do select a valid city, the jQuery method updates a hidden field that contains the CityID of the selected city.  This is working phenomenally well, and I really like the performance.</p>

<p>Here's where the problem enters.  If JS is not available in the browser, the ID field is not updated, and hence the DB is not updated.  I am not using the AutoComplete input on the server side at all, just the ID field.  What would be a good solution to circumvent this issue?</p>

<p>This one, supposedly checks the status of the audio to see if it's paused or ended:</p>

<pre><code>function togglePlayPause() { 
var audioPlayer = document.getElementsByTagName('audio')[0];
var playpause = document.getElementById(""playpause""); 
if (audioPlayer.paused || audioPlayer.ended) { 
     playpause.title = ""pause""; 
     playpause.innerHTML = ""pause""; 
} 
else { 
         playpause.title = ""play""; 
     playpause.innerHTML = ""play""; 
     } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or I've tried this one, which just toggles via the onClick <code>toggle(this)</code>:</p>

<pre><code> function toggle(obj) {
    if (obj.className== 'playButton') {
        obj.className = 'pauseButton';
        obj.title = ""PAUSE""; 
        obj.innerHTML = ""PAUSE"";
    } else {
        obj.className = 'playButton';
        obj.title = ""PLAY""; 
        obj.innerHTML = ""PLAY"";
        }

<p>Neither toggle the first time the button is clicked, although the first method does change from the default inner ""PLAY"" to ""play"", so I guess that's something:</p>

<p>Now, if I open a new browser tab and visit both domains for one time, my webapp runs as expected. </p>

<p>The question which comes up immediately after this observation is: what javascript-code can simulate this 'preopening' of foreign domains?</p>

<p>UPDATE: it seems that IE doesn't take third party cookies. According to this our system thought the user is not logged in and so he was thrown out. If we reduced related IE-Internetoptions all worked like expected. We are still looking for a solution which support IE-8 with default-options.</p>

The problem is, the view in the controller is supposed to display a countdown, so the view controller class has an NSTimer that will change a stringValue every second. But from what I can see, I have to use something like: </p>

<p><code>[instanceOfViewControllerClass view]</code> in another class so that the view will load and then <code>setStringValue</code> would work.</p>

<p>I asked a similar question before but the answer was what I said above, at the time I didn't know I would have to continuously change the view.</p>

<p>Basically what I'm looking for is something that works like this:</p>

<pre><code>//ViewControllerClass.m
-(void)startCountdown{
//here I make ""invocation"" using NSInvocation
[invocation setTarget:self];
[invocation setSelector:@selector(updateCountdown)];
timerLabelUpdater = [NSTimer timerWithTimeInterval:1 invocation:invocation repeats:YES];
}

-(void)updateCountdown {
//x would be calculated here by deducting 1 from an original amount of time
[timeLeftLabel setStringValue:@""x""];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Everything is working fine, if I put an NSLog in the updateCountdown it logs perfectly, which means it is running, I just can't get the label to change.</p>

<p>Using the answer above I've tried using <code>[self view]</code> and <code>[self loadView]</code> in several places in the code above, but neither of them make a difference.</p>

<p>I hope I've been clear on what I'm looking for this time, any help would be appreciated.</p>

I have followed <a href=""http://www.learn-cocos2d.com/2012/04/enabling-arc-cocos2d-project-howto-stepbystep-tutorialguide/"" rel=""nofollow"">this guide</a> which is very well done.</p>

<p>My goal is to convert the Cocos2d v1.x game project to Cocos2d v2.x and then refactor the project code to ARC.</p>

<p>To get started I created an empty HelloWorld Cocos2d v2.x project and created the v2.x static library (as from Steffen's guide). I then rafactored the code to ARC and the HelloWorld worked smoothly.</p>

<p>The issue is when I try to add to the same project the classes I had already written that don't complain to ARC (assuming that there will be not many Cocos2d v2.x vs v1.x problems - e.g. use of deprecated methods and classes like TouchJSON - my project doesn't at least as far I can see). So, I added a couple of Game classes that don't depend from the rest of the game (to reduce the number of potential Cocos2d v2. Vs v1 issues) to the project to see if the ARC covnersion worked for those as a proof of concept. After adding them I choosed: EDIT->Refactor option from XCode.</p>

<p>But now the compiler gives me some ARC warning messages like ""ARC forbids explicit message send of autorelease"" in the following method:</p>

<pre><code>return [[[self alloc] init] autorelease];
</code></pre>

<p>Or similar problems with the dealloc method already written.</p>

<p>I was assuming that EDIT->Refactor would have changed the added code but it appears to work only once. Any hint on this? <strong>should I add all my code to the new project template before refactoring the code?</strong> </p>

<p>EDIT:To verify whether it was an XCode bug I created an empty iOS project with no Cocos2d libraries and then converted it to ARC. Then created a new empty sublcass of NSObject and added a dealloc method and run the conversion again, it did work! So I might have not followed correctly some of the steps to create and link to the static library.. </p>

<p>In addition to this there are some other small issues (not XCode related, but Cocos2d v2.x related), like the fact that the <strong>CDXPropertyModifierAction</strong> is not automatically included to the CocosDenshion folder and I had to add it to the project after creating the static library (when I noticed the issue).. but I guess this is more template creation related.</p>

Windows 7<br/>
 <br/>
<strong>Path to where I am today:</strong><br/>
 - Generated a workspace<br/>
 - Generated a demo app to demonstrate a custom theme<br/>
 - Generated a new package that inherits from the ext-theme-neptune.<br/>
 - Modified the styles via the mechanisms provided in the sass directory of the new package.<br/>
 - Build the demo app and successfully shows the theme being applied.<br/>
 - I have brought Architect projects into the workspace. <br/>
- I can change the referenced theme and build those projects with Cmd to use the new theme. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Problem:</strong><br/>
 I can't figure out how to import the theme package into Sencha Architect. I've seen one post that mentions bringing in the output css as a resource, but that brings architect to it's knees, and doesn't seem correct. It seems like I should be able to bring in a theme just like Neptune and make available for applying as a theme. <br/>
<br/>
I've spent several business days trying to figure this out. I can't find documentation or forum posts trying to achieve this. It seems like the closest thing to what I'm trying to do is to use a user extension. But when I manually zip up my package into a .aux file, Architect says that it is an invalid package (with no further details). <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Desired Approaches:</strong><br/>
 - I'd like for Sencha Architect to see the package in my workspace and allow me to apply it as a theme to my apps.<br/>
 - Or, if I have to import it, I'd like to see some documentation specifically on how to import a theme package created with Sencha Command into Architect.<br/></p>

<p>now what I want to happen is for the anonymous method  <code>Action (() =&gt; {}</code>  in the first snippet to execute after the queue has completed <em>and</em> be able to contain the MD5 sum. I know there is thread safety issues here, so I understand I have to <code>invoke</code> this back to the parent thread where <code>textBox1</code> resides, but at the moment I am just lost as to how to do this (is it even possible?) </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I don't normally ""edit"" answers but in case anyone else hits this issue this is the code I eventually used, thanks to the answer from <code>usr</code>. Notice the <code>BeginInvoke</code></p>

<pre><code>  ultraHash hash = null;
  hash = new ultraHash(lblFolder.Text, (Action) (() =&gt; {
       this.BeginInvoke((Action) (() =&gt; {
            txtMain.Text = hash.getMD5();
        }));
  }));
  runQueue.addAction(hash);
</code></pre>

<p>also, if you are wondering why I did this, it is merely so that I can ""watch"" a folder for any file changes and then store meta data changes, since entire folders can be dragged in/out there needs to be a queueing mechanism in a FIFO queue, also the parent folders are hashed too, so any file alterations need to bubble up, lastly it may be that a file is locked when it is trying to be hashed in which case a FIFO queue can wait</p>

<p>My approach was to have only 1 class with the NSXMLParserDelegate methods, using different parsers per document (but with the same delegate) and differentiate between the parsers (aka documents) using the parser-argument in the delegate methods. but this is getting quite complex and i don't wanna end up with tons of different parser-instance-variables and if clauses.
isn't there a simpler way to do this? i thought of having 1 class per parsing operation (=> different delegates), but i guess that's even worse..</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/jessicajet/gTqV8/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/jessicajet/gTqV8/</a> is the form I am trying to use it with. (The fValidator script is not added here)</p>

<p>This is what I am using to submit the form</p>

    e.stop();
    new Request({
        url: this.get(""action""),

        }
    }).send();
});
</code></pre>

<p>When I hit submit the validation and the ajax form fires, which is to be expected.</p>

<p>Can I get the submit button to look for the validation script before the e.stop(); new Request({ or am I trying to do something not possible?</p>

<p>I will appreciate any advice that can be offered.</p>

<p>You can see the code <a href=""http://pastebin.com/sBSscSby"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and you can run it yourself (it has a main method) if you create a maven project with <a href=""http://pastebin.com/MSbB6wW6"" rel=""nofollow"">these</a> dependencies.</p>

"7184178","1","7184352","","2011-08-25 01:30:29","","3","3017","<p>We have a database called AVL in SQL Server 2008 R2 SE. This database has many tables, but there is one in particular called ASSETLOCATION that has 46 millon rows right now and accounts for 99.9% of the total database size.</p>

<p>This table has information from 2008 to date, and the actual rate of growing is about 120k records daily.
Now, there are 2 situations we like to address:</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance is starting to degrade slowly, and everything is
optimized so there's not much to do</li>
<li>Backup times are increasing and is becoming a problem (we do 1 full
backup everyday). The BAK file is 11GB, after winrar does his thing
the final size 2GB and then a script sends the file offsite. We have
a T1 and pulling 2GB through the wire is taking about 5 hours.</li>
</ul>

<p>All this is normal but here's the catch I want to capitalize on: +90% of SQL statements use information only 3 months old or less, in other words, data from 2008, 2009 and 2010 don't get accessed often.</p>

<p>I was thinking on creating one new database for each year. Lets say:
 - AVL2008 database, only table there will be ASSETLOCATION with records from 2008
 - AVL2009 database, only table there will be ASSETLOCATION with records from 2009
 - AVL2010 database, only table there will be ASSETLOCATION with records from 2010</p>

<p>As you have already guessed data from the past don't get changed, so this will be great from the backup perspective since the AVL database will only have the records from the current year. This approach will also help performance a lot.</p>

<p>Now for the problem. Assume the ASSETLOCATION table has the following columns:
 - IDASSETLOCATION (int, PK identity)
 - IDASSET (int, FK to ASSET table)
 - WHEN (datetime)
 - LATLONG (varchar(22), spatial info)</p>

<p>I need to create a view in the AVL database called ""vASSETLOCATION"", witch is quite simple, <strong>but I don't want the view accessing all the databases and joining the ASSETLOCATION tables via UNION</strong>, rather the only ones needed based on the WHEN field. For example:</p>

<pre><code>select * from vASSETLOCATION where [WHEN] between '2008-01-01' and '2008-01-02'
</code></pre>

<p>In this case the view should ONLY ACCESS the AVL2008.ASSETLOCATION table</p>

<pre><code>select * from vASSETLOCATION where [WHEN] between '2008-12-29' and '2009-01-05'
</code></pre>

<p>In this case the view should access AVL2008.ASSETLOCATION and AVL2009.ASSETLOCATION</p>

<pre><code>select * from vASSETLOCATION where 
    ([WHEN] between '2008-01-01' and '2008-01-01')
or 
    ([WHEN] = getdate())
</code></pre>

<p>In this case the view should access AVL2008.ASSETLOCATION and <strong>AVL.ASSETLOCATION</strong></p>

<p>I know a table scalar UDF in place of the view will solve the problem, but there are more than only 4 fields and [WHEN] is not the only field we may want to include in the where part. 
Before anyone suggest it, the table partitioning feature will perhaps help in performance, but NOT in the backup problem.</p>

<p>If there a way to do this in a view?
Thanks.-</p>

<p>As you can see THEME css is not included in appcache cause in real application URL may change any time so it should always be served from network.</p>

<p>The problem is when I enable SSL on server CSS file is not loaded at all. It works fine if I use HTTP or if I put CSS and its images into manifest. 
Please note this is reproduced only on Mobile Safari. (I have iPad3 with iOS 6.1).</p>

<p>Steps to reproduce are following: </p>

<ol>
<li>Open test page in Safari on iPad</li>
<li>Everything works fine</li>
<li>Close Safari entirely so it is not minimized but actually closed.</li>
<li>Open Safari.</li>
<li>Now it will try to restore last opened tab with our test page and here CSS fails to load.</li>
</ol>

<p>So basically I even do not get ""Mixed content warning"" - it just silently fails to load.</p>

<p>At first I thought there is some problem with certificate but as soon as I remove manifest attribute everything works fine.</p>

<p>Trying to find solution for several days now but everything I try is not working so I decided to ask here. Any ideas how to solve this?</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> This works fine on Chrome 23.0.1271.100 for iOS</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Reporting bug to Adobe and switching off appcache for now</p>

<p>Anyway, with that caveat out of the way... I'm trying to create a page where the images are in a row that extend off the right edge of the screen, so that the user can scroll to see more images. Other interface elements like the logo and nav are fixed in place.</p>

<p>You can see the page here: <a href=""http://werewolf.phantomlimb.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://werewolf.phantomlimb.net/</a></p>

<p>and the CSS here: <a href=""http://werewolf.phantomlimb.net/wolf.css"" rel=""nofollow"">http://werewolf.phantomlimb.net/wolf.css</a></p>

<p>To remove the spaces between the images I have floated them left.</p>

<p>My question is that in order to prevent the images from wrapping, even with a height attribute on the container div and display: block I have to give the div a width value, in this case 4000px. A width of auto for example makes the images wrap onto a new line, which is what I <em>don't</em> want! </p>

<p>As I may not always know the exact width of the combined images, is there a width value I can use that will force the images to stay in a single row, or some other CSS trick? </p>

<p>the class name mentioned in the error log (given above) points to something on Network related operation. I am not doing any i/o operation through my app.</p>

<ol>
<li>is there any direct compile or runtime dependency on org.cybernecko? Can i safely exclude it from my dependencies?</li>
<li>I tried excluding the page as 
<em>exclude group: 'org.cyberneko.pull', module: 'nekopull'</em> is this declaration correct ? Since, on trying to run tests, i end with same list of errors</li>
<li>I have used Maven to include and resolve dependency. Which package in the dependency tree references both <em>org.cyberneko</em> and <em>net.sf.cglib</em>. I tried tracing it but with no success.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are couple of posts on Stack Overflow that suggest to use the individual .java files and create a .jar file using the latest java compiler. I am unable to locate the source files for <em>org.cyberneko</em> and <em>net.sf.cglib</em>.</p>

<p>I work on the integration of ActiveMQ on a distributed system named ""RedCurrant"", so I create a correct DiscoveryAgent and make some changes in a ""jar"" wich I include in the ActiveMQ/lib.</p>

<p>So what I really want to do is a network of broker with persistence. So now I use KahaDB to do this, but I ask you if it is possible for the brokers to share a DataBase to share more quickly the messages of a topic. So Do I must create a JDBC Adapter? (The DataBase is not in the yet implemented Adapter of ActiveMQ : SQLite)</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>This is the EAR package which calls the bundle:</p>

<pre><code>import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpSession;
import org.osgi.framework.BundleContext;

@Named(""loginController"")

public class userCheck extends HttpServlet implements Serializable {

   @Override

        throws ServletException, IOException {
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        out.println(cryptoSha.stringHash(""test""));
    }

   }
}

<p>I successfully compile and deploy then on JBoss 7.1.0 but when I start the EAR package nothing happens. Can you help me to find where I'm wrong in the code?</p>

<p>kind regards,
Peter </p>

<p>EDIT:
Unfortunately I'm new to java programming and some of the code in the examples I don't understand how they work. Would you be so kind to help me with the example. I need to see how this code must be written in proper way in order to use it in future time? Would someone repair the code?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.

<p>That would explain why it produced ""zzzbc"". </p>

<p>Now my question is how can I get <code>map</code> to be able to know about <code>echo ""abc""</code> having reached the end of input? cf. <code>echo ""abc"" | cat</code> completes on its own. ReadKey does not seem to provide API for determining this situation. </p>

<p>Similarly I am not sure how to do the same to pass along the EOF to the child in the pty. I am thinking this might cause issues when a command is to write to a file or something, because EOF vs sending a kill signal is the difference between writing the file correctly and not exiting cleanly. </p>

<p>At the moment I am using <code>Linq</code> to query the XML document, but I need to improve the performance of my application and I thought to replace the <code>Linq</code> query with <em>old style loops</em>, but I did not have any boost.</p>

<p>Following is a piece of code with the most called query:</p>

<pre><code>Stopwatch stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
XDocument xdoc = XDocument.Load(""filename.xml"");
string def = ""Version"";
XElement xelm;

stopwatch.Start();

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++)
    xelm = xdoc.Descendants(""def"").Where(d =&gt; d.Attribute(""name"").Value == def).Single();

stopwatch.Stop();
Console.WriteLine(stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);


stopwatch.Restart();

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++)
{
    foreach (var elm in xdoc.Descendants(""def""))

</code></pre>

<p>The elapsed time is pretty much the same for both versions, and for me this result is quite strange since I thought that the <code>Where</code> method of <code>Linq</code> has to create a new list when invoked.</p>

<p>Why both versions have the same performace? Is there a way to improve the original code?</p>

<p>I'm working with a research group on campus learning about robotics and automation. My current task is learning the insides and outs of the Arduino motor shield and combine it with a bluetooth shield.</p>

<p>We're using <a href=""http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/bluetooth-shield-p-866.html?cPath=132_134"" rel=""nofollow"">this bluetooth shield</a> and <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoMotorShieldR3"" rel=""nofollow"">this motor shield</a>.

<p>For the most part, my current code works with each board individually, but when I combine them, suddenly nothing works. The motor portions only work when the bluetooth specific code is commented out. Which leads me to the conclusion that there are pin conflicts.

<p>This appears to happen only when the ASP.NET web service and its application pool is first started and the web method is invoked. Most times the application will continue on without issue but too often the application pool will not recycle properly and the service invocation fails since the application pool was shut down or crashed.</p>

<p>The environment is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows Server 2003 </li>
<li>IIS 6</li>
<li>ASP.NET 3.5 SP2</li>
<li>ODP.NET 2.112.1.0</li>
<li>Oracle 10g</li>
</ul>

<p>The code is remarkably simple. It makes a single call to the Oracle data base (though it is wrapped in a custom class). Here's the critical piece of the code that is causing the error (obfuscated a little as I cannot publish the exact code).</p>

<pre><code>string sql = ""select distinct url from schema1.idconfig cfg inner join "";
sql += ""schema1.nsgem_idconfig_vi_xref schema2 on cfg.configuration_id = schema2.config_id where schema2.id = :id"";

using (Query qry = new Query(""DBConnectionName"", sql))
{
    qry.AddParameter(""id"", 5449);

    using (IDataReader reader = qry.ExecuteReader())
    {
        while (reader.Read())
        {
            string url = reader.GetValue(0).ToString();
            urls.Add(idVal);
        }

        reader.Close();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>Query</code> inherits from DataCommand and on construction creates a new OracleCommand, sets the bind by name to true, and creates a new OracleConnection and sets the CommandType to Text.</p>

<p>If I remove all database code from the service no errors are logged. Re-implementing the database code results in the errors being logged again the first time the code runs after an IISRESET.</p>

<p>What might be causing this error and how might I go about troubleshooting it?</p>

<p>I can put this chunk of code anywhere in my PHP script and when execution hits those lines, authentication will be requested. If authentication fails, script execution will stop and a 401 Unauthorized header will be sent with the specified message. This is what I want in Python/Django.

<pre><code>def some_view(request):
    if request.REQUEST.get('key') == 'value':

<li>to be able to put this chunk in code anywhere in code and have it require authentication from user (let's assume request variable is available to me, a django.http.response.HttpResponse instance also, as response)</li>
<li>to be able to specify the condition under which authentication will be requested (like the presence of a parameter in the request)</li>
<li>to halt further execution if the user supplies invalid credentials and to return a 401 Unauthorized response</li>
<li>for the solution to be portable (copy/paste the chunk of code elsewhere and authentication will be triggered there once execution gets to it)</li>
</ul>

<p>What I DON'T want:</p>

<ul>
<li>to have authentication requirement hardcoded on a call of a function (with a decorator)</li>
<li>to change any global settings of my web application</li>
<li>to change anything else outside the part of code I want my authentication to trigger</li>

<p>The problem is that when I scale down to tablet or phone, where I use col-12's for each half page, in which I stack them on top of eachother, instead of side by side, the 100% sized image div is way too big on a tablet, and squishes out the other div (since section height is only 100%). And on mobile it's way too small, so it shows a bunch of empty space under the image. </p>

<p>I feel like the only way to get it to scale properly is by having no height set on the container, with an img tag used in the div instead of a background image, since it will only take up as much space as it needs, and not any extra. The problem however is that now it's not filling up the entire image div that it's inside, leaving empty space on the side's and bottom. I've tried setting different sizes, settings, etc, but no matter what I do it won't fill it up. It does the same thing on tablet and mobile as well. How can I get this to work?</p>

<p>I installed php 5.3.28 from source and copied php.ini-production from the source to /usr/local/etc/php53/php.ini. I used the following configure options so that PHP would read that file.</p>

<pre><code># Rearranged for readability
Configure Command =&gt;  './configure'  
                  '--with-config-file-path=/usr/local/etc/php53' 
                  '--with-config-file-scan-dir=/usr/local/etc/php53/conf.d'
                  '--prefix=/usr/local' 
                  '--enable-debug' '--enable-mbstring' '--enable-soap' '--enable-zip' '--with-bz2' '--with-curl' '--with-gettext' '--with-mcrypt' '--with-mhash' '--with-mysql' '--with-openssl' '--with-pdo-mysql' '--with-pspell' '--with-readline' '--with-tidy' '--with-xsl'
</code></pre>

<p>Well, PHP doesn't read that file.</p>

<pre><code>$ php -i | grep Configuration' File'
Configuration File (php.ini) Path =&gt; /usr/local/etc/php53
Loaded Configuration File =&gt; (none)
$ php --ini
Configuration File (php.ini) Path: /usr/local/lib
Loaded Configuration File:         (none)
Scan for additional .ini files in: (none)
Additional .ini files parsed:      (none)
</code></pre>

<p>How can it be that <code>php -i</code> and <code>php --ini</code> have different output for <em>Configuration File (php.ini) Path</em>?</p>

<p>(Some answers/comments to similar questions want to know which <code>php</code> command is in use. It's important to note that this issue is with <code>php</code> on the commandline, so the <code>php</code> above is the only one. Whether or not Apache is using a different <code>php</code> is not relevant in this case.)</p>

<p>I do not have <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/18157969/418413"">any php environment variables</a> set:</p>

<pre><code>$ env | grep PHP
$ export | grep -iF php
$ set | grep -iF php
</code></pre>

<p>There is no output for any of the above.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/18157969/418413"">I can force</a> <code>php</code> to do what I want via a commandline flag (evidence that php can read and parse the file)</p>

<pre><code>$ php -nc /usr/local/etc/php53/php.ini -i | grep -F Configuration' Fi'
Configuration File (php.ini) Path =&gt; /usr/local/etc/php53
Loaded Configuration File =&gt; /usr/local/etc/php53/php.ini

Loaded Configuration File:         /usr/local/etc/php53/php.ini
Scan for additional .ini files in: (none)
Additional .ini files parsed:      (none)
</code></pre>

<p>But why does it not load the file I specified to <code>configure</code> when I don't give it any flags on the commandline?</p>

This got me to the end of the maze but it breaks after.  I need a way to break out of the loop.  I just started learning about recursion so i think this is the problem but im not exactly sure.</p>

<p>For example, you have class A and class B. Both classes have similar methods. Using DRY principle, I made a class C, then moved the similar methods from class A and class B to class C, and assign class C as the parent class of A and B. Does it became not orthogonal?</p>

They're all set to render small by default (max-width of 500px in this case), but if the image is wider than it is tall I want to render it larger with a max-width of 900px. I want to do this with a script (I'm using jQuery) because I don't know what the image sizes are beforehand and can't hard-code in their max-widths. I am using max-width instead of width because I don't want to overstretch images that are less than 900px. </p>

<p>In doing this, I want to set the image size before the image is loaded (so it doesn't flash in its original size then to the new size, moving all the elements in the page around in the process), but after DOM is created (so I can access their naturalHeight and naturalWidth).</p>

<p>This is what I tried:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
img.portfolio {
  max-width: 500px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
    $(""img.portfolio"").each(function(){ 
        if ($(this)[0].naturalHeight &lt; $(this)[0].naturalWidth) {
          var ratio = $(this)[0].naturalHeight / $(this)[0].naturalWidth;
          $(this).css(""max-width"", 900);
          $(this).css(""max-height"", 900*ratio);
          $(this).width($(this)[0].naturalwidth);
          $(this).width($(this)[0].naturalheight);
        }
    });

});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But I find that this only works sometimes! It seems to work all the time in Chrome, but I noticed the first time I load the page in Firefox it won't work and all images have a width of 500px, but subsequent page reloads it will work. I loaded the page in Firefox with cache off and it didn't work. Why is this the case? How do I fix it? And why is this a problem in Firefox but not Chrome?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Additional mystery: I made a <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/25jbo1k9/5/"" rel=""nofollow"">fiddle</a> for the question, and I couldn't actually reproduce the bug in the fiddle in Firefox. What! So I made an example on a tumblr, which is what I'm trying to get this script to work with. It is <a href=""http://25jbo1k9.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, and it randomly sometimes works and doesn't work in both Firefox and Chrome when I have browser cache off. What's happening? I suspect this has to do with how tumblr renders its templates; how do I circumvent this irregularity? </p>

Then implement the IteratorAggregate interface and create a getIterator method within. However, I am currently confused on the role each of these elements play and in what format they need to be written. In other words, I am just looking for a simply (plain-English) explanation of these concepts and a simple example. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!!!</p>

{

<p>I like the exception because it shows where the problem happened while if I get a NaN in a final result of a long computation I will have more difficulties to understand where the NaN was born.

<p>Is there any other way of cope with the empty vector?

<p>Hmm. Looks like -lrt is already there, maybe I don't have librt.a? Nope searching all files reveals I have /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.a. I guess g++ is looking in the wrong place. So in the above command line I replace -lrt with /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.a and bingo! it compiles and links fine. Unfortunately, this is an automated tool and I need this to work on many computers and can't make assumptions about the location of librt.a so I really need it to work with -lrt. So how do I set the local libary search path? First attempt is changing LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable but apparently ( from what I can tell from more googling ) this is ignored on ubuntu and instead I should be messing with .conf files in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/, however I already it looks like I already have x86_64-linux-gnu.conf in there with the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>03-16 23:07:38.478  13646-13646/com.example.cello.myownquiz E/AndroidRuntime﹕ FATAL EXCEPTION: main

</code></pre>

<p>Is my MediaPlayer class okay or am I missing something depending on the state? Is this class the only spot to call release or do I have to put it somewhere in my activity, too?</p>

<p>Does anybody see my mistake? This problem with the mediaPlayer took me a whole day of trying, hope you can help me...</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end

class Message &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many_polymorphs :consumers, 
    :from =&gt; [:projects, :messages], 
    :through  =&gt; :message_consumers,
    :as =&gt; :comment   # Self-referential associations have to rename the non-polymorphic key
end

class MessageConsumer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  # Self-referential associations have to rename the non-polymorphic key
  belongs_to :comment, :foreign_key =&gt; 'comment_id', :class_name =&gt; 'Message'

  belongs_to :consumer, :polymorphic =&gt; true
end
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the Message wouldn't get deleted when the Project is removed, because the Message is really the parent in the relationship.</p>

<p>I simplified it a little for the example, but there are other models that have have a Message, and there are also Attachments that work similarly.</p>

<p>What would be the correct way to set this up so that the children get removed when the parent is deleted? I'm hoping to not have a million tables, but I can't quite figure out another way to do this.</p>

<p>I'm trying to develop an app which the user can drag/drop, resize and rotate some accessories into a pet's photo.</p>

<p>So, the user interface worked fine, but I've got myself in trouble trying to recreate the image on server-side...</p>

<p>Have a look, it should be like the user interface:
<a href=""http://s23.postimg.org/dslq6klqj/rotate_sample.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s23.postimg.org/dslq6klqj/rotate_sample.jpg</a></p>

<p>But, when I try to apply the matrix transformation:</p>

<pre><code>    Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap(Server.MapPath(""~/Content/Images/"" + src));
    Rectangle area = new Rectangle(left, top, width, height);

    Matrix m = new Matrix(float.Parse(matrix[0]), float.Parse(matrix[1]), float.Parse(matrix[2]), float.Parse(matrix[3]), float.Parse(matrix[4]), float.Parse(matrix[5]));
    Graph.Transform = m;

    Graph.DrawImage(bmp, area);
    Graph.ResetTransform();
</code></pre>

<p>And... It's resulting (actually it's rotating, but also, it makes I lose my x and y reference):

I have done the whole process with the help of the <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/38160/WCF-Service-Library-with-Windows-Service-Hosting"" rel=""nofollow"">this link</a> from the Code Project.</p>

<p>After creating all the functionality of WCF, it built successfully and also created WCF DLL file. Now, I have created Windows Service project inside the same solution Explorer for hosting the service DLL. Inside the <code>OnStart</code> method I have written the below code:</p>

<pre><code>namespace WindowsService1
{
    public partial class Service1 : ServiceBase
    {
        ServiceHost sHost;
        public Service1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        protected override void OnStart(string[] args)
        {
            sHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(WcfServiceLibrary1.Service1));
            sHost.Open();
        }

        protected override void OnStop()
        {
            sHost.Close();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For adding the <code>WcfServiceLibrary1</code>, I have added the reference of the WCF DLL in this service. To do this, right click on the project in <em>Solution Explorer</em> and select <em>Add Reference</em>. For adding the DLL in reference, select browse tab in the window that appears, and navigate to the folder where our WCF service library is located. In that location, the DLL can be found inside the ""bin\Release"" folder.</p>

<p>After adding the reference it gives no error, but when I am going to the build the solution it gives the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The type or namespace name 'WcfServiceLibrary1' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have added the reference once again, the error disappeared and then I have built the solution again. The same error message appeared.</p>

<p>I could not understand why is this happening. Even I have followed the link thoroughly and prepared the solutions once again from the beginning, but the same error message is coming each and every time.</p>

<p><strong>The above issue is resolved now by following toadflakz's answer.</strong> Now, my service is installed correctly but getting the below exception at <strong>OnStart.</strong></p>

<pre><code>Service cannot be started. System.InvalidOperationException: Service 'WcfServiceLibrary1.WCFService' has zero application (non-infrastructure) endpoints.

<p>The following code is what I use in the <code>viewDidLoad</code> of my view controller:</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableDictionary *stringAttributes = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];


[stringAttributes setObject:[UIColor redColor]forKey: NSForegroundColorAttributeName];


NSString *someString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@"", @""S""];

</code></pre>

<p>What is it that I'm doing wrong ?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: After following @rokjarc's suggestions, I have created a view controller with a <code>drawRect</code> method that adds the string to the current context:</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;


@interface XYZSomeView : UIView
@end

#import ""XYZSomeView.h""
#import ""NSString+NSStringAdditions.h""


@implementation XYZSomeView

- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect {

    [super drawRect:rect];

    CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();
    CGContextSaveGState(context);

    NSMutableDictionary *stringAttributes = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];


    [stringAttributes setObject:[UIColor redColor]forKey: NSForegroundColorAttributeName];


    NSString *someString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@"", @""S""];

    [someString drawAtPoint:CGPointMake(rect.origin.x, rect.origin.y) withAttributes: stringAttributes];

    NSLog(@""%@"", someString);

    CGContextRestoreGState(context);
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>And inside my root view controller I init the <code>XYZSomeView</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#import ""XYZRootViewController.h""
#import ""XYZSomeView.h""


@implementation XYZRootViewController
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];

    self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];



    XYZSomeView *someView = [[XYZSomeView alloc] init];

    [self.view addSubview:someView];

}
- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {
    [super didReceiveMemoryWarning];

    NSLog(@""%@"", @""XYZRootViewController reveived memory warning"");
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is that my <code>drawRect</code> is not called, is that because I have to call it myself ? I thought that this method should be called upon initialization without me having to call it.</p>

<ol>
<li>In Resource file-> Dialog editor I added a Picture Control box(Type=Rectangle)</li>
<li>I had a look at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7187072/handling-wm-paint-in-a-subclassed-cstatic-control"">this</a> problem and tried to keep continuing the way.</li>
<li>Right-Click on Picture Control box and Add a variable.</li>
</ol>

<p>4.In MainDlg.Cpp file and In Onpainting(); section, the following code Has is added:</p>

<pre><code>CPaintDC dc(this);
CRect rect;
GetClientRect(&amp;rect);
dc.FillSolidRect(&amp;rect, RGB(120,255,0));
</code></pre>

<p>However I added above command to the following command which I think belongs to the Dialog painting(I don't know If it make problem or not):</p>

<pre><code>CRect rect;
    GetClientRect(&amp;rect);
    int x = (rect.Width() - cxIcon + 1) / 2;
    int y = (rect.Height() - cyIcon + 1) / 2;

    // Draw the icon
    dc.DrawIcon(x, y, m_hIcon);
}
else
{
    CDialog::OnPaint();
</code></pre>

<ol start=""5"">
<li><p>In main.Cpp file and in function OnInitDialog(); this code added:</p>

<p><code>m_PictureControlVariable.SubclassDlgItem(IDC_STATIC_PictureControl, this);</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>(Where IDC_STATIC_PictureControl is Picture Control ID in dialog editor)</p>

<ol start=""6"">
<li><p>I am going to call Picture Contorl color be changed when an Event happens, I mean in a Callback Function which Sends Message to a Dialog I am calling this Picture Control as:</p>

<p><code>m_PictureControlVariable.EnableWindow();</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now I recieve a debug error!!</p>

<p><strong><em>Updated:</em></strong></p>

<p>I added a MFC Class with a CStatic type(In Menu bar-> Project-> Add Class):
A code With following .Cpp and .H included to original project:</p>

<pre><code>  #include ""stdafx.h""
#include ""Main.h""
#include ""PICTURECTRL.h""


// PICTURECTRL

IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC(PICTURECTRL, CStatic)

PICTURECTRL::PICTURECTRL()
{

}

PICTURECTRL::~PICTURECTRL()
{
}


BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP(PICTURECTRL, CStatic)
    ON_WM_PAINT()
END_MESSAGE_MAP()



// PICTURECTRL message handlers
void PICTURECTRL::OnPaint()
{
    CPaintDC dc(this); // device context for painting
    //@TG
//#3073
        // TODO: Add your message handler code here
        // Do not call CStatic::OnPaint() for painting messages
CRect rect;
GetClientRect(&amp;rect);
dc.FillSolidRect(&amp;rect, RGB(0,0,255));
}
</code></pre>

<p>and as you can see I added OnPaint() message handler manually from Resource View-> Class View-> Properties-> Message.</p>

<p>Header of derived Class is:</p>

<pre><code>#pragma once


// PICTURECTRL  (Picture Control)

class PICTURECTRL : public CStatic
{
    DECLARE_DYNAMIC(PICTURECTRL)

public:
    PICTURECTRL();
    virtual ~PICTURECTRL();

protected:
    DECLARE_MESSAGE_MAP()
public:
    afx_msg void OnPaint();

};
</code></pre>

<p>And in Original code after Adding a Variable to Picture Control these Commands Added to MainDlg.Cpp MainDlg.H, sequently:</p>

<pre><code>    void CMainDlg::DoDataExchange(CDataExchange* pDX)
{
    CDialog::DoDataExchange(pDX);
    //{{AFX_DATA_MAP(CMainDlg)
    // NOTE: the ClassWizard will add DDX and DDV calls here
    //}}AFX_DATA_MAP
    DDX_Control(pDX, IDC_PROGRESS1, M_progressBar1);
    DDX_Control(pDX, IDC_PictureControl, m_PicCtrl);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and in Header file of Original file just <code>CStatic m_PicCtrl;</code> added to the public part of Main class, I mean:</p>

<p><code>class CMainDlg : public CDialog
{public:
protected:
public:
CStatic m_PicCtrl;}</code></p>

I'm thoroughly enjoying the curriculum and have found myself to have a better understanding than most others in my class so far, but this assignment has me stumped.</p>

<p>The assignment is to read in a text file of passenger names (first and last initial), seats (A1, B1, C1, D1, A2, etc.), and ticket prices. The output is specified to be a table of passengers and their seats sorted by seat order, and I also have to print the minimum and maximum ticket prices along with the owner of each ticket, along with the average of all ticket prices. My arrays are all reading in correctly, and the minimum, maximum, and average ticket prices were all easy to find. My problem is the sorting. We were introduced to arrays a couple weeks ago and this is our first time doing any sorting. We are supposed to use a bubble sort, and while I think I gather how to use a bubble sort, it's not working in my program (so obviously I don't really know how to use it). I have tried several different things, and sometimes a few seats/names will switch around (never the way I want them to) and sometimes nothing will happen at all.</p>

<p>Anyway, TL;DR: New to programming, not trying to get homework done for me, need to bubble sort airplane passengers and seats by seat order (A1, B1, C1, D1, A2, etc). Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p>I have a 1D character array for the columns(A - D), a 1D integer array for rows (1 to maximum integer), 1D float array for prices, and 2D array for name initals.</p>

<p>Here's the function to read in the arrays:</p>

<pre><code>void read_Arrays(char seat_cols[], int seat_rows[], char name[][LAST], float price[])
{
int i, j;

    for(i = 0; i &lt; SIZE; i++)
    {
        for(j = 0; j &lt; LAST; j++)
        {
            scanf("" %c"", &amp;name[i][j]);
        }  
        scanf("" %c %d %f "", &amp;seat_cols[i], &amp;seat_rows[i], &amp;price[i]);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the sort. The way we were shown to do it was with a 'for' loop nested within a 'do while':</p>

<pre><code>do

    flag = 0;

<p>The maximum ticket price is 891.55 and the owner is JB.</p>

<p>Disregard the ticket prices, those are working properly.  I see that the row numbers are sorted, and the names are still associated with their correct seats, but the columns are all over the place.</p>

<p>If I use the Uri from the file (<code>Uri.fromFile(file)</code>), the camera won't exit after taking the photo and tapping on the 'ok' button (looks like can't write to the Uri or who knows what).</p>

<p>Using the <code>File</code> <code>String</code>, in the form of <code>'/data/data/com.package.bla/cache/img198346262jpg'</code>, it's not working as well (The file is there, but it's empty because the camera is not saving anything on it).</p>

<p>What I tried so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deleting the file after creating it, as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/6449092/801913"">this example</a> does. However, the file doesn't exist after the camera exits.</li>
<li>Added External Storage READ permission, just in case</li>
</ul>

<p>So I have no idea why the image is not being saved and already spent/wasted a lot of time testing and figuring why it's not working.</p>

<p><strong>Fragment:</strong></p>

<pre><code>private void launchCamera() {
    Intent cameraIntent = new Intent(android.provider.MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE);
    File outputDir = getActivity().getCacheDir();
    File file = null;
    try {
        file = File.createTempFile(""img"", ""jpg"", outputDir);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    if (file != null) {
        mImageUri = Uri.fromFile(file);   //using Uri is not even exiting the camera
        //mImageUri = File.toString();    //If I use String instead of an Uri, it works better (ie, can accept camera photo)
        cameraIntent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, mImageUri);
        startActivityForResult(cameraIntent, RESULT_TAKE_IMAGE);
    }
}


public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
        Bitmap original = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(mImageUri.toString(), bounds);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Edited code, mImageUri. As explained, if I use Uri I can't even accept the photo in the camera app. Using a String will let me accept the photo, though the photo is not actually saved (ie the file has 0 bytes inside it).</p>

<p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong>: The problem was related to saving into the cache directory. Maybe it's a bug, I am missing a permission or the camera app just can't save into your application private data directory. Adding Permission FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION didn't solve it.

<p>I am running the linux kernel version 3.2. I have the id's needed to identify the usb device. I have created a kernel module for reading and writing to the device. The kernel module has been tested and works properly. The kernel module creates /dev/Component#.</p>

<p>I am trying to write a program that is notified of a USB device connection event and thus will not need to loop over the /dev/Component# and check if the file exists. My hope is that there is a signal/notification/event that already exists. I have seen the libusb, but my understanding is that you are really just creating a loop that reads all the devices. I have considered adding a syscall, but recompiling the kernel isn't really an option.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
void binaryConvert(int);
int main() {
    using namespace std;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Enter decimal number for conversion:"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    int dec;
    cin &gt;&gt; dec;
    binaryConvert(dec);
}
void binaryConvert(int number) {
    using namespace std;
    while(number &gt; 0) {
        int bin = number % 2;
        number /= 2;
        cout &lt;&lt; bin;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Logically, this program would print the binary the other way around. I spent a long time trying to figure out how to invert the order of the binary digits so that the binary number would appear the right way around when I came across this piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>void binaryConvert(int number) {
    using namespace std;
    if(number &gt; 0) {
        int bin = number % 2;
        number /= 2;
        binaryConvert(number);
        cout &lt;&lt; bin;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know its probably a stupid question (I'm an absolute beginner), but I can't figure out why this code prints the bits in the correct order. Also, how come the bits actually get printed if the function gets called again before cout even gets executed?</p>

<p>This lets me edit and add them inline, which worked fine while I was on Django 1.5.
Now, every time an <code>Article</code> has an <code>EventRecord</code> that contains an <code>event_date</code> I get the error below. Any ideas what might cause this? I changed no code at all after the update, but I can't find anything obvious in the documentation what might cause this.
To me this is especially weird, because I didn't edit the admin interface at all. No hacks there, just plain vanilla Django Admin. And, as I said before, on 1.5 it worked flawless.</p>

Now I work in a bigger company and so a lot of File Paths etc. are different.
And I'm wondering if it's possible to pass the Python file a Path, and then import
the Modules (for example urlib) from this path.</p>

sys.path.append(path)
import urllib
import httplib
...

<p>So I was wondering if it's possible to pass a parameter for the variable path, 
so sys.path.append(path) will change with the parameter given and the libraries 
are imported correctly.</p>

<p>I’ve also tried many other php.ini configurations. The file uploading class that I’ve built received posted file data from XmlHttpResponse request using xhr.send(file). I’ve debugged infos with firebug header is normal, post totally empty (normally it should be the file data, an in-read-able text), cookies are the ci_session cookies, and no xhr response text at all. I’ve write a script that will return some response no matter what, though.</p>

<p>I’m no experts in this, rather a newbie. This all information at hand that I can give to you guys. So, any ideas on what happen in this? I’m really stuck here can’t get this problem solve.</p>

<p>If there should be any info that I can look for and give it to you to get this problem solved do tell me so.</p>

<p>thx in advance.</p>

<pre><code>/WebApp/ &lt;-- IIS Application here
/WebApp/bin/ &lt;-- binaries here
/WebApp/web.config &lt;-- empty.
/WebApp/WorkflowApp/V1.0/web.config  &lt;-- Settings are stored here
/WebApp/WorkflowApp/V1.0/MyWorkflow.xamlx
/WebApp/WorkflowApp/V1.0/Default.aspx &lt;-- just for testing
/WebApp/WcfService/V1.0/web.config  &lt;-- Settings are stored here
/WebApp/WcfService/V1.0/MyService.svc
/WebApp/WcfService/V1.0/Default.aspx &lt;-- just for testing
</code></pre>

<p>My web.config contains the following section:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;appSettings&gt;
  &lt;add key=""TestSetting"" value=""Test Setting Value"" /&gt;
&lt;/appSettings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>From one of my code activities in my workflow service, and from inside my WCF service, I want to read an item from ""appSettings"" using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>var config = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""TestSetting""];
</code></pre>

<p>This always returns null. I also tried WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""TestSetting""], but this also returns null. It seems that the web.config hierarchy is not working for appSettings.</p>

<p>Just for testing, I added a Default.aspx with the following contents to see if this appSetting is accessible from an ASP.NET web page, and it works!</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;
            TestWebApp
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;%= ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""TestSetting""] %&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that the web.config in the sub-folder is not processed at all. Why doesn't the configuration scoping not work for AppFabric workflow/WCF services? And what can I do to make it work?</p>

<p>If I place the workflow/WCF service in the root of my web applicaiton in IIS, the appSettings section is accessible as expected. It is only when I place my workflow service in a sub-directory, the configuration sections are not accessible.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I have modified the question to generalize it to WCF and Workflow services, because it affects both cases. The reason I'm trying this, is to reduce the number of IIS applications and application pools.</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/yasserabdelkader/archive/2010/09/12/release-of-windows-server-appfabric-architecture-guide.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Windows Server AppFabric Architecture Guide</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Similarly to the application pool planning, we recommend that you logically group multiple services into a web application where it makes sense. AppFabric is designed to handle hundreds of web applications.  However, for optimum performance and manageability, the goal should be to keep the number of web applications as small as practically possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this text, it leads me to believe that having multiple WCF/Workflow services in sub-folders of web apps should work.</p>

<p>I have an object hierarchy in which each object is solely and fully responsible for serializing itself.  My latest attempt has been to create a stream at the highest level, then pass that stream reference down and allow each object to create its own XmlWriter to serialize itself to the stream.  However, this ends up creating nodes within incomplete parent nodes (the start element is not fully formed in the parent before child content is written, even with a flush).</p>

<p>There are multiple appdomains, so passing the XmlWriter reference will not work.  I was having each object return a string and writing that raw XML string into the stream, but some of the strings get to be very, very long (collections).  That's why I decided on a stream -- so that each object could write out small pieces at a time and a stream instance is both serializable and MBR.</p>

<p>I decided against using XmlSerializer for reasons I didn't seem to document.  But I'm going to trust my earlier judgment on that.</p>

I may also accept anything in between.</p>

<p>Let's say you have a non-thread-safe object type such as <code>Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;</code>. For the sake of argument, I know you can also use <code>ConcurrentDictionary&lt;int, string&gt;</code> which is thread safe, but I want to talk about the general practice around non-thread-safe objects in a multi-threaded environment.</p>

<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>private static readonly Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; SomeDictionary = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;();
private static readonly object LockObj = new object();

public static string GetById(int id)
{
  string result;

  /** Lock Bypass **/
  if (SomeDictionary.TryGetValue(id, out result)
  {
    return result;
  }

  lock (LockObj)
  {
    if (SomeDictionary.TryGetValue(id, out result)
    {
      return result;
    }

    SomeDictionary.Add(id, result = GetSomeString());
  }

  return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The locking pattern is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-checked_locking"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Double-Checked Locking"">Double-Checked Locking</a>, since the lock is actively bypassed if the dictionary is already initialized with that id. The ""Add"" method of the dictionary is called within the lock because we only want to call the method once, because it will throw an exception if you try to add an item with the same key.</p>

<p>It was my understanding that this locking pattern essentially synchronizes the way that Dictionary is handled, which allows it to be thread safe. But, I got some negative comments about how that doesn't actually make it thread safe.</p>

<p>So, my question is, is this locking pattern acceptable for non-thread-safe objects in a multi-threaded environment? If not, what would be a better pattern to use? (assuming there's not an identical C# type that is thread-safe)</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that, when the new content gets loaded in, the page keeps scrolling upwards (viewport).</p>

<p>Is there something I'm missing? I just want the viewport to stay fixed on the current position and to load everything underneath the so called 'fold' when the infinite scroll function gets called.</p>

<p>Is this because if you scroll to the bottom too quickly, then images above the 'fold' still get loaded in, forcing the page to appear to scroll ""up"". If so, maybe infinite scroll isn't appropriate for my blog?</p>

<p>You can check it out here: <a href=""http://blog.rainbird.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.rainbird.me/</a></p>

The web server is scaffolded with yeoman-angular-generator(0.7.1). I had configured a proxy to serve up my APIs to facilitate development earlier and it was working fine. Later we decided to enable html5mode for angular and I enabled the connect-modrewrite to serve index.html when static files are not found. Strangely the proxies are not working now. I make the call to <a href=""http://localhost:7272/api/v0.1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:7272/api/v0.1/</a>/17 and it does not return the response for <a href=""http://localhost:8181/api/v0.1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8181/api/v0.1/</a>/17...

<p>When used in a 'typical' web site, the 'client side' flow works just fine. Now, I'm trying to integrate this Google+ sign inside PhoneGap. Since PhoneGap runs the web page as a file:// URL, the origin that gets sent in the request is file://. In every other PhoneGap I've written, this hasn't been a problem.</p>

<p>However, when I click the Google+ sign in button from my page in PhoneGap, the origin being sent as file:// causes the following error message:</p>

<p><strong>Error: invalid_request</strong><br />
Invalid parameter value for origin: Missing authority: file://</p>

<p>I went to the Google API console and tried to assign file:// as an authorized Javascript origin. But, of course, it doesn't allow file:// to be entered as an origin.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering if anyone has any insight in how to do this kind of web-style (Javascript) Google+ sign in from within PhoneGap (or from a local web page where there is no server - just a page being run as a file://). I really don't want to have to do the sign-in in native code and then integrate the token back over into the 'PhoneGap' realm since that kind of defeats the purpose of writing the app once for multiple platforms.</p>

When I save data such as username and password in my application, the data is inserted as what I input but with added text, Example: I would send the username <code>""Mark""</code> to be inserted, but when I go to look at my database, it is put in as <code>""System.Windows.Forms.TextBox, Text: Mark""</code>.

<p>The code used to move between the forms is as follows</p>

<pre><code>Sub NextForm(strFormName As String)
    Dim intCurPos As Integer
    Dim strNewForm As String

    'Find out which form we are currently on from a list in a range
    intCurPos = WorksheetFunction.Match(strFormName, Range(""SYS.formlist""), 0)
    If intCurPos = WorksheetFunction.CountA(Range(""SYS.formlist"")) Then
        'We want to use the first one
        intCurPos = 0
    End If

    'Get the name of the form to open
    strNewForm = WorksheetFunction.Index(Range(""SYS.formlist""), intCurPos + 1)
    'Load the form into the Userforms Collection
    Set newForm = VBA.UserForms.Add(strNewForm)
    'Show the form
    newForm.Show
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>The issue I have is that after you do this 25 times (yeah I know) the system crashes. I realise that this is because everytime you get to the newForm.Show line above the code doesn't get to complete and so sits in memory.</p>

<p>Modeless forms would stop this issue but then the user could load other forms and do other things which would cause major issues.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions to help with this? Somehow to force code execution but not stop the modal ability of the form?</p>

<p>Long shot but appreciate any help.</p>

<pre><code>Exception Value: too many SQL variables
</code></pre>

<p>And I think the answer to it is this, from <a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html"">http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many SQL programmers are familiar with using a question mark (""?"") as a host
  parameter. SQLite also supports named host parameters prefaced by "":"", ""$"", or
  ""@"" and numbered host parameters of the form ""?123"".</p>
  
  <p>To prevent excessive memory allocations, the maximum value of a host parameter
  number is SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER, which defaults to 999.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, there's a remaining oddity that I don't understand, which is that the
same query runs fine from a django shell session (launched with <code>python
manage.py shell</code>), but not when the call is made from my <code>views.py</code>.</p>

<p>These are the lines of code that are causing the error:</p>

<pre><code>vals = Company.objects.filter(id__in=comp_ids).values('id', 'name').order_by('name')
names_map = SortedDict(vals)
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>comp_ids</code> is a set containing 1038 integer elements.</p>

<p>The exact same query, with an even greater no. of <code>comp_ids</code> (3800+) runs fine in
the django shell (launched with <code>python manage.py shell</code>) - the dictionary gets
created, and I could iterate through it.</p>

<p>I've tried breaking up <code>comp_ids</code> into sets of e.g. <code>[:996]</code> (that seemed to be the
limit before it barfed) i.e. <code>filter(id__in=comp_ids[:996])</code>, then the rest in
the next iteration, which would be consistent with the ""no. of host parameters""
explanation.</p>

<p>But why would it work in the django shell but not from <code>views.py</code>?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Some more information:
Entering the query into the sqlite shell (manage.py dbshell) returns the full
set of results with no errors, same as in the django shell (manage.py shell).</p>

<p>Here are the exact list of parameters (1039 elements) and the query, if you'd
like to know the details:</p>

<p>(Incidentally, you don't need to use pdb for that - django very helpfully
displays the backtrace in the browser (in render_to_response()?) when an error occurs, with a
full list of the local variables at each step, so you can see the full query
there.)</p>

<p>I had, however, previously tried stepping into the django code with pdb, and
found the error was actually originating from python's pysqlite2.dbapi2 (or
sqlite3.dbapi2) module, at line 200 of django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py:</p>

<pre><code>return Database.Cursor.execute(self, query, params)
</code></pre>

<p>(which was also in the helpful backtrace shown in the error page), where
Database is an alias for either pysqlite2.dbapi2, or sqlite3.dbapi2, depending
on your python version.</p>

<p>But I thought that was too far down the call stack to keep debugging (for now),
so decided to stop, and started thinking about workarounds and googling for
answers instead. :)</p>

<p>I'm using a NetBeans-based IDE (MPLAB X) to program an embedded system in C (with the XC8 compiler). It is very easy to build the project, and when I add .c or .h files to the project via the GUI, it automatically adds them to the set of files that are compiled.</p>

<p>What is common practice for automation of adding files to be passed to a tool? (such as a static analyser, (I will probably use splint, or possibly frama-c).</p>

<p>In other words, I would like to be able to run the static analyser by hitting a shortcut key, whereby it will include all necessary .c and .h files automatically, analyse them, and return the result. </p>

<p>Yet another way of putting it: I don't want to have to manually manipulate the arguments sent to the static analyser CLI executable each time I add a .c or .h file, or change their names, etc. </p>

<p>How should this be done? How is this typically done for supplementary tools to the build process, such as static analysers?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>This is one of many attempts I'm making at being able to sniff loopback traffic. The best-looking lead I have so far is to use RawCap, but it's just not grabbing the packets for some unknown reason (I have another post on this topic).</p>

<p>Also, I'll note that Windows Loopback Adapter (WLA) is not a solution for me. The traffic I'm trying to catch is on 127.0.0.1. WLA requires an address other than 127.0.0.1 be used.</p>

<p>Basically I have a form where a user enters a variety of info.  It’s the FOD entry form.  One of the input boxes on this FOD entry form is to select an organization - this has a corresponding hyperlink which upon clicking takes them to the search form to select an organization.</p>

<p>For this search form I am using UpdatePanels and AutoExtenders.  So, a user can begin typing in either an org code or an org name and the AJAX AutoExtender will display a dropdown as they type which displays the possible org codes and names.<br>
If they hit “Enter” with either a partial entry or full entry of the org they want, a hyperlink will display with the org code, name, and address for each of the possibles.  They can then click the link for the org they want and it will return to the FOD entry form with the organization box populated with the data they selected from the org search form.</p>

<p>However, the problem is if they don’t hit “Enter” but rather select a name from the drop down list by using the mouse, that hyperlink containing the info they need to populate the FOD form will not show.  I haven’t been able to figure this out thus far and am wondering if it’s something I’m doing in the AJAX controls.  Any help would me most appreciated!</p>

<p>There is some fairly complex database work which will be using postgreSQL and python.</p>

<p>There needs to be a professional looking public website which can access some of the database content both to generic ""customers"" and tailored data visibility to actual clients.</p>

<p>None of the traditional CMS offerings like wordpress, drupal, joomla etc seemed flexible enough, so I found my way to django. </p>

<p>I've built models, populated data tables, built some basic views to manipulate the data and started to play a bit with html layout tags and css, and I've started looking at forms including crispy-forms.</p>

<p>I need to work with pdf files - scanning, uploading, splitting into single pages, displaying on the site alongside form data entry etc.</p>

<p>I was hoping that I could use django-cms to handle the aspects of the public facing words and pictures and dealing with the jpgs pdfs etc, and to do the page layout stuff, while using django models and python to simplify the database access and provide the intelligence.</p>

<p>When I read the django-cms docs around integrating models I get the impression that there is not really a proper integration - that you can build a site that switches between cms pages and django pages or maybe embeds a django view into a cms page, but I'm not sure if I can do the look and feel and static bits in cms and the dynamic bits on the same page in django without still having to do the work in django as well. </p>

<p>the django system revolves around the models, the django-cms docs read as if models are some sort of extra bit you might want to use.</p>

<p>There's talk of the different ways to integrate django models but they all treat the django model as a foreign item that can be added.</p>

<p>I've found other people who've asked ""how does django-cms work with django models"" and the answers seem to be no different from those that ask ""how do I ad a django model to a drupal site""</p>

<p>So my question really is - does django-cms integrate with django to provide ease of building sites with good integration between cms features and model features or are they really two separate systems that can share space on the same page with a bit of work but don't play nice together in any useful way?</p>

<p>Is there another tool I can use for my static stuff and page formatting and navigation to integrate with my models and python code?</p>

<hr>

<p>There is abstract class StrategyEditor (derived from some class in framework) which is instantiated whenever a new StrategyForm is opened.</p>

<p><code>StrategyForm</code> (a customized window frame) contains <code>StrategyEditor</code>.<br/>
<code>StrategyEditor</code> contains <code>StrategyTab</code>.<br/>
<code>StrategyTab</code> contains <code>StrategyCanvas</code>.<br/></p>

<p>This is a small portion of the big classes to clarify that there are many objects that will be created if one StrategyForm object is allocated in memory at run-time. My component owns all these classes mentioned above except <code>StrategyForm</code> whose code is not in my control.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, at run-time, user opens up many strategy objects (which trigger creation of new StrategyForm object.) After creating approx. 44 strategy objects, we see that the USER OBJECT HANDLES (I'll use UOH from here onwards) created by the application reaches to about 20k+, while in registry the default amount for handles is 10k. <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms725486%28VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Read more about User Objects here.</a> Testing on different machines made it clear that the number of strategy objects opened is different for message to pop-up - on one m/c if it is 44, then it can be 40 on another.</p>

<p>When we see the message pop-up, it means that the application is going to respond slowly. It gets worse with few more objects and then creation of window frames and subsequent objects fail.</p>

<p>We first thought that it was not-enough-memory issue. But then <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/51y09td4%28VS.71%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">reading more about <code>new</code> in C#</a> helped in understanding that an exception would be thrown if app ran out of memory. This is not a memory issue then, I feel (task manager also showed 1.5GB+ available memory.)</p>

<p>Q1. Does this look like a memory issue and I am wrong that it is not?<br/>
Q2. Does this point to exhaustion of free UOHs (as I'm thinking) and which is resulting in failure of creation of window handles?<br/>
<strong><em>Q3. How can we avoid loading up of an <code>StrategyEditor</code> object (beyond a threshold, keeping an eye on the current usage of UOHs)? (we already know how to fetch number of UOHs in use, so don't go there.)</strong> Keep in mind that the call to <code>new StrategyForm()</code> is outside the control of my component.</em><br/>
Q4. I am bit confused - what are <em>Handles to user objects</em> exactly? Is MSDN talking about any object that we create or only some specific objects like window handles, cursor handles, icon handles?<br/>
Q5. What exactly causes to use up a UOH? (almost same as Q4)</p>

<p>I would be really thankful to anyone who can give me some knowledgeable answers. Thanks much! :)</p>

<p><strong>[Update]</strong><br/>
Based on Stakx answer, please note that the windows that are being opened, will be closed by the user only. This is kind of MDI app situation where way too many children windows are opened. So, <code>Dispose</code> can not be called whenever we want.</p>

"29272298","1","","","2015-03-26 06:27:01","","1","40","<p>I have a Python app with many modules. There's a YAML config file which contains configuration settings for each module. In each module's <strong>init</strong>(), I load the config and then process it into a config dictionary for that module.</p>

<p>The processing is ugly right now. Dozens and dozens of lines at the beginning of each module with a lot of stuff like:</p>

<pre><code>if 'foo' not in config:
    config['foo'] = bar
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>if 'foo' in config:
    config['foo'] = string_to_list(config['foo'])
else:
    config['foo'] = list()
</code></pre>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>So now I want to write a centralized config processing method that each module can use. I'm thinking that I want to use a YAML-formatted string to specify what the final config should look like. (Which settings are mandatory, default values, object types, etc.)</p>

<p>I'm thinking the config specification in each module could be something like this: (with the type|default|required values)</p>

<pre><code>config_template = """"""MySection:
                       setting1: int|0
                       setting2: string|None|required
                       setting3: int|10""""""
</code></pre>

<p>So far, so good. My real question is whether there's any way for me to save this config specification thing in each module in a docstring for <strong>init</strong>() or something. I'm thinking that since I'm essentially defining exactly what the module expects for its config, along with the defaults and the types, if I could store this config thing in the docstring then I ought to be able to write something and/or configure sphinx to pretty it up for the documentation?</p>

<p>So I wonder if this approach sounds sane in general, and, if so, is there a way I can store this config info in the docstring to get it to work as double duty?</p>

<p>EDIT: I considered setting up a dictionary with default values first, and certainly that will take care of the defaults. But there are a lot of cases where I need the values to be of a certain type. For example, maybe some have to be a list, but if a single item is entered into the config file it will be read as a string, so I need the config processor to convert the string to a list with that string as its only item.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: The reason I was asking about the docstring is because I was thinking that my config specification would essentially tell a programmer what this modules was expecting in terms of a config dictionary, so if I can do it in the docstring then I can just specify it once and have the module use it for its config as well as have it appear in the sphinx documentation. But if that's not possible, then so be it. I can use it in a variable (like in my example above) and then write the docstring manually.</p>

<p>Thanks!

<p>I am using jquery to clone a line of fields in order to build my invoice items.</p>

<p>What is NOT working now is the specific line of fields are not updating.</p>

<p>These are my fields:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" name=""item_sku[]"" data-required=""1"" class=""form-control item_sku"" autocomplete=""off"" required/&gt;

&lt;input type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" name=""item_description[]"" id=""description"" data-required=""1"" class=""form-control calculate description"" required/&gt;

&lt;input type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" name=""item_amount[]"" data-required=""1"" class=""form-control calculate rate"" autocomplete=""off"" required/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So when I start typing int he ITEM_SKU field, I get my autocomplete options - which is working fine. And when I click on it, it must update the description and item_amount textfields.</p>

<p>Now if I change the field class to an ID, and the javascript to example </p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" name=""item_amount[]"" id=""rate"" data-required=""1"" class=""form-control calculate"" autocomplete=""off"" required/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It works.</p>

<p>But because I have an ""add more fields"" button - I have to have multiple fields with the same ID.</p>

<p>Could someone please assist me so that the current line's fields gets updated with <code>ui.item.description</code> and <code>ui.item.rate</code></p>

<p>Maybe I should also be using a FileWrapper (like in this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/908258/generating-file-to-download-with-django"">post</a>), but I get identical results with and without it.</p>

<p>So I tried to use java object <strong>MulticastSocket</strong>. Luckily Oracle have a page with an <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/datagrams/broadcasting.html"" rel=""nofollow"">example of Broadcasting</a>.</p>

<p>Here I have rearranged it for my use.</p>

<p>Server code:</p>

<pre><code>long FIVE_SECONDS = 5000;        
int port = 4445;

DatagramSocket socket = new DatagramSocket(port);

while (true) {
    System.out.println(""Server running..."");
    try {
        // message for client
        String dString = ""Hello Client"";                
        byte[] buf = dString.getBytes();

        // send
        InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName(""230.0.0.1"");
        DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length, group, port);
        socket.send(packet);

        // sleep for a while
        try {
            Thread.sleep((long)(Math.random() * FIVE_SECONDS));

        catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.err.println(""Interrupted Exception"");
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.err.println(""IOException"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Client code:</p>

<pre><code>MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(4445);
InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName(""230.0.0.1"");
socket.joinGroup(address);

// receive the message
byte[] buf = new byte[256];
DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length);
socket.receive(packet);

String received = new String(packet.getData(), 0, packet.getLength());
System.out.println(""Received: "" + received);

socket.leaveGroup(address);
socket.close();
</code></pre>

<p>When I run Srver: no problem, but when I try running client it throw <code>java.net.BindException: Address already in use</code> cause both client and server are listening/sending information on <code>port 4445</code>.</p>

<p>But isn't it right? <strong>To connect each other they must have the same port number, or they'll never 'meet'</strong>.</p>

<p>Can I solve this problem? How?</p>

<p>Are the port number correct?</p>

<p>Is this a right resolution to the problem about the unknown server ip?</p>

<p>One of the feature requirements is to be able to have a magnified view show up on a clicked region of an image; so, looking at an image, I want to click the mouse, and have a 200% image window show up where the mouse is.  As I drag my cursor, the window should follow the cursor.</p>

<p>The context is set up like:</p>

<p>The Big Red Book has code that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>        Gl.glShadeModel(Gl.GL_FLAT);
        Gl.glClearColor(0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f, 0.0f);
        Gl.glPixelStorei(Gl.GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 2);
        Gl.glPolygonMode(Gl.GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, Gl.GL_LINE);

        Gl.glDisable(Gl.GL_SCISSOR_TEST);
        Gl.glDisable(Gl.GL_ALPHA_TEST);
        Gl.glDisable(Gl.GL_STENCIL_TEST);
        Gl.glDisable(Gl.GL_DEPTH_TEST);
        Gl.glDisable(Gl.GL_BLEND);
        Gl.glDisable(Gl.GL_DITHER);
        Gl.glDisable(Gl.GL_LOGIC_OP);
        Gl.glDisable(Gl.GL_LIGHTING);
        Gl.glDisable(Gl.GL_FOG);
        Gl.glDisable(Gl.GL_TEXTURE_1D);
        Gl.glDisable(Gl.GL_TEXTURE_2D);
        Gl.glPixelTransferi(Gl.GL_MAP_COLOR, Gl.GL_TRUE);
        Gl.glPixelTransferf(Gl.GL_RED_SCALE, 1.0f);
        Gl.glPixelTransferi(Gl.GL_RED_BIAS, 0);
        Gl.glPixelTransferf(Gl.GL_GREEN_SCALE, 1.0f);
        Gl.glPixelTransferi(Gl.GL_GREEN_BIAS, 0);
        Gl.glPixelTransferf(Gl.GL_BLUE_SCALE, 1.0f);
        Gl.glPixelTransferi(Gl.GL_BLUE_BIAS, 0);
        Gl.glPixelTransferi(Gl.GL_ALPHA_SCALE, 1);
        Gl.glPixelTransferi(Gl.GL_ALPHA_BIAS, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>And then the call to make the smaller-but-zoomed image looks like</p>

<pre><code>        int width = (int)((this.Width * 0.2)/2.0);
        Gl.glReadBuffer(Gl.GL_FRONT_AND_BACK);
        Gl.glRasterPos2i(0, 0);
        Gl.glBitmap(0, 0, 0, 0, mStartX - (width*2), mStartY, null);

        Gl.glPixelZoom(2.0f, 2.0f);
        Gl.glCopyPixels(mStartX - width, mStartY, width, width, Gl.GL_COLOR);
</code></pre>

<p>where mStartY and mStartX are the points where the click happened.</p>

<p>Problem is, the window that shows up is really mangling the lookup tables, and really clamping the image down to essentially a black-and-white binary image (ie, no shades of grey).  </p>

<p>The data is a black-and-white unsigned short array, and is set with this code:</p>

<pre><code>        float step = (65535.0f / (float)(max - min));
        mColorTable = new ushort[65536];
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 65536; i++)
        {
            if (i &lt; min)
                mColorTable[i] = 0;
            else if (i &gt; max)
                mColorTable[i] = 65535;
            else
                mColorTable[i] = (ushort)((float)(i - min) * step);
        }       
        .... //some irrelevant code

        Gl.glPixelMapusv(Gl.GL_PIXEL_MAP_R_TO_R, 65536, mColorTable);
        Gl.glPixelMapusv(Gl.GL_PIXEL_MAP_G_TO_G, 65536, mColorTable);
        Gl.glPixelMapusv(Gl.GL_PIXEL_MAP_B_TO_B, 65536, mColorTable);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, according to <a href=""http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs414/opengl/glCopyPixels.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this documentation</a>, I should use GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_I and set INDEX_SCALE and INDEX_BIAS to zero, but doing that does not change the result, that the image is severely clamped.  And by 'severely clamped' I mean it's either black or white, with very few shades of grey, but the original non-magnified image looks like what's expected.</p>

<p>So, how do I avoid the clamping of the magnified view?  Should I make a second control that follows the cursor and gets filled in with data from the first control?  That approach seems like it would take the array copies outside of the graphics card and into C#, which would almost by definition be slower, and so make the control nonresponsive. </p>

<pre><code>class EasyLogger(object):
    SEP = "" ""

    def __init__(self, logger=logging.getLogger(__name__)):
        self.logger = logger

    def _format_str(self, *args):

    def debug(self, *args):

    .... repeated for the other logging methods, like info, warning, etc....

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        return getattr(self.logger, name)
</code></pre>

<p>This gives me syntax like:</p>

<pre><code>LOG.debug(""some_variable: "", some_variable)
</code></pre>

<p>which I like. I don't want to inherit from <code>logging.Logger</code> because composition is better than inheritance and I don't really want to mess around with builtin classes like that. </p>

<p>My format string looks like:</p>

<pre><code>LOGGING_FMT = ""&lt;%(filename)s:%(lineno)s(%(levelname)s) - %(funcName)s() &gt;""\
                        ""%(message)s""
</code></pre>

<p>but this doesn't work, because the line numbers and function name always report as something inside <code>easylogger.py</code> rather than the calling function. </p>

<p>I've fixed this issue by following <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4957858/how-to-write-own-logging-methods-for-own-logging-levels"">this</a> fantastic answer and monkeypatching the <code>findCaller</code> method of <code>EasyLogger.logger</code>, which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, logger=logging.getLogger(__name__)):
    self.logger = logger
    # Ugly, ugly, ugly dirty hack to fix line numbers
    self.logger.findCaller = find_caller_monkeypatch
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but I'm confused. I originally defined <code>find_caller_monkeypatch</code> with the following signature: </p>

<pre><code>def find_caller_monkeypatch(self):
</code></pre>

<p>(the body of the function is copy+pasted from the answer that's linked). However, this causes an error:</p>

<pre><code>  File ""/usr/lib64/python2.7/logging/__init__.py"", line 1262, in _log
    fn, lno, func = self.findCaller()
TypeError: find_caller_monkeypatch() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)
</code></pre>

<p>Removing <code>self</code> as an argument to <code>find_caller_multipatch</code> fixes the error, but I'm confused: why isn't <code>find_caller_monkeypatch</code> getting <code>self</code> as an argument when it's called as <code>self.findCaller()</code>? Do methods only get <code>self</code> as a parameter if they're defined inside of the class?</p>

<p>The following snippet is a smaller example of the same issue:</p>

<pre><code>In [7]: class Foo(object):
   ...:     def say_hi(self):
   ...:         print ""Hello World""
   ...:

<pre><code>&lt;ComboBox ItemsSource=""{Binding SourceList, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}"" 
                                      SelectedItem=""{Binding Source={x:Static local:MySingleton.Instance}, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged, 
                                      Path=PossibleNullProperty.PossibleNullProperty.PossibleNullProperty.Source}"" 
                                      Width=""Auto"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works very well and even if the PossibleNullProperty is null, as soon as they change, the 'Source' property is binded to the ComboBox.</p>

<p>Now I have also a Command Binding in my ModelView which binds to a DelegateCommand in the ViewModel. As soon as the SelectedItem changes, the DelegateCommand should raise the CanExecuteChangedEvent. </p>

<p>Well I can't raise this event in the Object where the 'Source' property is. 
So I have to raise this event in the ViewModel. 
My Idea was to create a property which points to the nested property like this:</p>

<pre><code>public string Source
    {
        get { return MySingleton.Instance.PossibleNullProperty?.PossibleNullProperty?.PossibleNullProperty?.Source; }
        set
        {
            MySingleton.Instance.PossibleNullProperty.PossibleNullProperty.PossibleNullProperty.Source = value;
            RaisePropertyChanged();
            MyCommand.RaiseCanExecuteChanged();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now the problem is, at the time when the Binding occurs, a property in the chain is null so the ComboBox SelectedItem can't ""reach"" the 'Source' property. 
During the Application Runtime, this can change and the 'Source' property is ""reachable"", but the ModelView doesn't get updated.</p>

<p>How can I achieve a solution for my problem?</p>

However I do not want to introduce additional dependencies to any osgi-specific libraries.</p>

<p>As such annotations are out of the question as are programmatic calls to bundle contexts and what not.</p>

<p>I have found a near match to my requirements in declarative services which allows me to expose my lower level bundles without impacting dependencies however at the higher level (where i actually need to consume the services) i'm still a bit stuck.</p>

<p>I understand that the component xml can be used to declare implementations of services (which i already use for my lower level jars) but also to inject service instances into a specific POJO.</p>

<p>Now my question: how do I get access to the osgi-managed POJO which has the services injected into it? Is it at all possible without introducing new dependencies or do I have to do it programmatically? </p>

<p>If the latter is the case can someone point me in the direction of some code to do it, in other words the component-equivalent of bundleContext.getServiceReference()?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>To clarify, if you take the fifth part of this tutorial: <a href=""http://www.vogella.com/articles/OSGiServices/article.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vogella.com/articles/OSGiServices/article.html</a></p>

<p>He declares a component.xml file which uses reference binding to inject a service into the object QuoteConsumer.
Great, now how do I get an instance of QuoteConsumer that has the necessary services injected into it, I can't very well do ""new QuoteConsumer()"" right?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE2</strong></p>

<p>Currently I am registering the instance created by osgi as a static variable which can be requested, I'm thinking this is not the best method especially because I can't set the constructor to private. (the latter would at least result in a true singleton)</p>

<p>Basically the Factory class has:</p>

<pre><code>private void activate() {
    instance = this;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE3</strong></p>

<p>A full example of a factory:</p>

<pre><code>public class Factory {

    private static Factory instance;

    public static Factory getInstance() {
        if (instance == null)
            instance = new Factory();
        return instance;
    }

    private MyInterface implementation;

    public void setMyInterface(MyInterface implementation) {
        this.implementation = implementation;
    }

    public void unsetMyInterface(MyInterface implementation) {
        implementation = null;
    }

    public MyInterface getMyInterface() {
        if (implementation == null) {
            ServiceLoader&lt;MyInterface&gt; serviceLoader = ServiceLoader.load(MyInterface.class);
            Iterator&lt;MyInterface&gt; iterator = serviceLoader.iterator();
            if (iterator.hasNext())
                implementation = iterator.next();
            else
                implementation = new MyInterfaceStub();
        }
        return implementation;
    }

    @SuppressWarnings(""unused"")
    private void activate() {
        instance = this;
    }
    @SuppressWarnings(""unused"")
    private void deactivate() {
        instance = null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any client code can then do:</p>

<pre><code>Factory.getInstance().getMyInterface();
</code></pre>

<p>and receive the OSGi loaded service, the SPI loaded one or a stub.
You can still manually set the service instance if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE4</strong></p>

<p>To clarify further: this pattern is not meant for applications that are designed from the ground up to be run in an OSGi container but rather for low level libraries that have to run everywhere and even when on an OSGi container must not assume that all consumers are actually using OSGi.</p>

If i prevent <code>NSFetchResutlsController</code> form deleting object when i segue to details like below then after coming back from details view the table view cell do not respond to my click events. i.e. the table does not segue, nothing happens on clicking,</p>

<p>I need to check whether each number up to a value specified by my user is a prime number. Therefore I brute force check whether each number up to that value (which I technically want to be as large as the user wishes it to be) is a prime number by the method of checking whether</p>

<pre><code>p%i==0
</code></pre>

<p>is true where p is the user-entered value for every odd number 3

<p>Obviously, cycling through every single odd number up to half of the entered value takes a while once the program starts checking very big numbers. Due to this limitation, my program in its current state slowed down its ""numbers checked per second"" rate by quite a lot on big numbers, which meant that the program could take a long time to finish for very big numbers.</p>

<p>To somewhat remedy this, I tried to implement multithreading for the prime checking aspect, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>int CPUs = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
int acCPU = 0;
//...
Thread pCheckThread[] = new Thread[CPUs-1];
class pCheckRunnable implements Runnable{
    long pr;
    int xp, yp;
    pCheckRunnable(long prime){
        pr=prime;
    }
    public void run(){
        if(isPrime(pr))
            //Do stuff...
    }
}
//...
for(long i=1; i&lt;valueEntered; i++){
    pCheckThread[acCPU] = new Thread(new pCheckRunnable(i));
    pCheckThread[acCPU].start();
    acCPU++;
    if(acCPU&gt;=CPUs){
    for(int t=0; t&lt;pCheckThread.length; t++){
        try {
        pCheckThread[t].join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    acCPU = 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can hopefully see, the idea was to check whether several numbers are prime at once, with each check running in a separate thread up to a maximum number of threads equal to the number of processor cores available.</p>

<p>Problem is, <em>the program seems to now actually be running slower</em>.</p>

<p>This is my very first time trying my hand at multithreading and parallel processing, and I may just have made some very stupid mistakes or my code might be a huge mess in some of you more experienced coders' opinions, so feel free to tell me if I've done any serious mistake that could cause instability or corruption etc.</p>

I don't know much about the content of the strings, a little more then 2/3 are human language words with the rest being something closer to a UUID or number/letter combo.  I know that any particular grouping will be constant (ie if it has some human words it will be all human words, if it has some UUID all the contents will be UUIDs etc).</p>

<p>I need to decide if I should place this data in a map or a hashmap to get the best average lookup rate.  I'm inclined to say map with the O(log n) runtime because I don't believe I can make a proper efficient hash for strings when I know so little about their input format.  Any thoughts as to which would be better?</p>

<p>EDIT:
I forgot one key aspect.  I don't know the length of the strings and so am concerned memory usage may grow too lage for long strings.  If I used the hash method I would do something where after X characters the hash doesn't hash on a per-character basis to avoid the memory consumption being too huge.</p>

<p>What I would really like is a hash map implementation that keeps multuple values in the 'bucket' sorted in an ordered manaer so it can offer a (log N) search of the buckets; but I don't think that exists in stardrd C++ and it's not worth writeing from scratch.  </p>

<p>pps. the data is near-static.  which I'll occasionally have to add to the list it's rare and I'm willing to accept a slow write time.  I only care about the lookup time.</p>

<p>Here are the snippets of code that are important. It is a custom shapefile, so I don't know how to put it on here so people can replicate it.</p>

<p>This bit reads in the shapefile and plots it. The display type is 'polygon' if that is relevent, hence getting rid of the <code>'FaceColor'</code> so I can see what I am plotting underneath (the green bits in the background of the images, plotted using <code>pcolor</code>).</p>

<pre><code>thaiborder=shaperead('Thailandborder');
mapshow(thaiborder,'FaceColor','none');
</code></pre>

<p>This bit is how I am exporting the figure.</p>

<pre><code>export_fig test.eps -r600 -painters
export_fig test.pdf -r600 -painters
</code></pre>

<p>This is the version with a smooth border from Matlab 2014a:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/09dpO.png"" alt=""2014a version""></p>

<p>This is roughly the same area of the image, with the jagged border from Matlab 2014b:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/EhHhV.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Does anyone know why these differences are occurring? I want the border to be like it is in the first image, but I need the ""improved"" functionality of Matlab 2014b for another thing in the same image. What do I need to change?</p>

<p><strong>Edit to add:</strong> I have been in contact with the creator of <code>export_fig</code> and he thinks it is caused by Matlab now using mitred joins rather than round ones. Apparently I have to write to MathWorks to complain. I didn't put this as an answer because someone else may be able to provide a solution for me.</p>

<p>The problem I have is when the datasource is retrieved locally (as in the jfiddle example) it works fine, but when I set it to retrieve remote data it doesnt work. Here is the <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/VbnAx/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">jfiddle link</a> for the remote data code (this wont work in jfiddle regardless because it wont be able to connect to my webapi but you get the point).</p>

<p>The problem seems to be in the Change event of the datasource. When the data is local it all seems to execute sequentially so when you reference this or self than it is talking to the viewmodel. When using remoting it calls back into the change function but doesnt seem to be referencing the correct object anymore and when I set selectedContact it does nothing to the bound objects on the form.</p>

<p>Does anybody have any ideas how I should be referencing the selectedContact object in the Change method of the datasource object? Or advice on where im going wrong?</p>

I have since learned more about the problem and can put it in a more clear and concise way which will hopefully help solve this.</p>

<p>Whenever I try to post to a page the controller maps the url to  the access-denied-handler as specified by mvc-dispatch-servlet.xml. If I try to get to a page then it hits the correct @requestmapping and everything is ok.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/fx4XV.png"" alt=""Get and post to the same url getting different results"">
I have tried adding     </p>

<pre><code>&lt;intercept-url pattern=""/pages/ReceiveFile"" access=""permitAll""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which does nothing. </p>

<p>I have just recently narrowed this problem down to </p>

<pre><code>&lt;filter-mapping&gt;
    &lt;filter-name&gt;springSecurityFilterChain&lt;/filter-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/filter-mapping&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which seems to be blocking the post operations. If I change this to /pages/* then I can post to a page that is /ReceiveFile because it is mapped that way in web.xml. This skips the main controller altogether. With that setting if I try to go to pages/ReceiveFile it still goes through the controller and goes to the 403 page. I don't believe bypassing my controller with all post operations is a good permanent solution.</p>

<p>How do I allow these post operations to go through?</p>

<p>I've done other apps with timers over a fairly extended time period and never come across this problem before. </p>

<p>Basically, what's happening is that when the app launches, I set an <code>NSDate</code> value with <code>[NSDate date]</code>. Then, I have a scheduled <code>NSTimer</code> object that fires regularly and checks how much time has elapsed by comparing the current <code>[NSDate date]</code> value against the original one.</p>

<p>As far as I know, that's the correct way to do this sort of thing, but please correct me if I have a faulty assumption in the above paragraph.</p>

<p>Anyway, when testing on my new iPad over the last few weeks, I've variously (and randomly) caught a few times where it appears that my system time is jumping around a good bit. In one instance, the time seems to have jumped 64 seconds! This meant that my timer label displayed '00:03' and then immediately displayed '01:08' (add a second correctly and then 64 incorrectly)!!! At other times, it has resulted in a negative event duration.</p>

<p>It's an intermittent occurrence, so I'm basically asking whether this could be:</p>

<ol>
<li>An iOS 5.1 bug</li>
<li>Something to do with the hardware specific to the new iPad (never had this issue on iPad 1st Gen, 2nd Gen, several iPhone/iPod Touch versions, etc...)</li>
<li>Bad Code (I'll admit this is possible, but it's not like the NSDate value ever becomes something other than an NSDate value, and I've checked every place in my project where this <code>singleton</code> value is set.</li>
</ol>

<p>Has anyone had any similar experience? Can anyone help?</p>

<p>What method can I override or page event where I am ensured that the property state is set?</p>

<p>I think in a page it is PageLoaded versus the Page_Load override? I am looking for this in the user control because my property is always null even though it is set.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Example. This is in my user control. FilterEntryId is being bound from inside another user control:</p>

<pre><code>protected int _filterEntry = -1;
    public int FilterEntryId
    {
        get

    }


    protected void Page_Load(dobject sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        FilterEntry always -1!!
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The property is being set but never has value when Page_Load. The Page_LoadComplete may be the proper place but does not seem to be an option in user control. I've also tried Page_DataBind.</p>

<p>My hypothesis is that this is a page lifecycle issue but it may be something else.</p>

You can only set factor labels when they are created with the factor function. There is no <code>labels&lt;-</code> function. Not that 'labels' and 'levels' in factors make any sense....</p>

<pre><code>&gt;  fac &lt;- factor(1:3, labels=c(""one"", ""two"", ""three""))
&gt; fac
[1] one   two   three
Levels: one two three
&gt; labels(fac)

<p>OK, I asked for labels, which one might assume were as set by the factor call, but I get something quite ... what's the word, unintuitive? </p>

<pre><code>&gt; levels(fac)

<p>So it appears that setting labels is really setting levels.</p>

&gt; levels(fac)

<pre><code>&gt;  fac &lt;- factor(1:3, levels=c(""one"", ""two"", ""three""), labels=c(""x"",""y"", ""z"") )
&gt; labels(fac)
[1] ""1"" ""2"" ""3""
&gt; levels(fac)
[1] ""x"" ""y"" ""z""

<p>Effing weird, if you ask me. It would seem that 'labels' arguments for factor trump any 'levels' arguments for the specification of levels. Why should this be? Seems like a confused terminology.  And why does <code>labels()</code> return what I would have imagined to be retrieved with as.character(as.numeric(fac))?</p>

Does java clear the list variable automatically, or have I clean it by using <code>clear()</code> API and how then?

    &lt;/facility&gt;       
  &lt;/facilities&gt; 
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the corresponding code to install this would be </p>

<pre><code> container

</code></pre>

<p>Where Windsor.config is the xml above.</p>

<p>In a fluent form</p>

<p>Typyically you can do stuff like</p>

<pre><code>             .AddFacility&lt;NHibernateFacility&gt;(""NHibernate"", cfg=&gt;cfg.FacilityConfig)
</code></pre>

<p>However from the options in Intellisense it is unclear if anything will provide what I want from the xml snippet above.</p>

<p>I have done some searches which have returned the following which either do not work or refer to a previous version. I am using NHibernate 2 for this one project with Castle.</p>

<p><a href=""http://tunatoksoz.com/post/Fluent-Interface-for-NH-Facility-e28093-Take-1.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Tuna Toksoz post</a></p>

<p>But with no joy. Can anyone help! I know, I know I could always use a different IOC! But I am curious if anyone else has come across this issue. I can also just leave it as xml but I prefer the fluent configuration because I can then dynamically set connections strings and other factory properties at will.</p>

<p>Any help will be most appreciated.</p>

<pre><code>@Transactional
class AnalyticsService {
    boolean newStreamView(Long streamId) {

    Stream stream = Stream.lock(streamId) // The exception is launched here
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this only occurs if there are many concurrent calls to this service.
As I can see, hibernate is trying to lock with ID and version parameters:</p>

<pre><code>select id from stream where id =442 and version =305 for update
</code></pre>

<p>and this fails. If I disable the optimistic locking (version: false) inside of that domain class, everything works fine (hibernate just use the id for locking the row). </p>

<p>As posted in <a href=""http://www.anyware.co.uk/2005/2012/11/12/the-false-optimism-of-gorm-and-hibernate/"" rel=""nofollow"">Marc Palmer's Blog</a> seems that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only foolproof way to avoid StaleObjectException(s) while keeping optimistic locking ON, is to do all GORM work in transactions, and always load objects with Domain.lock(id). When using dynamic finders or criteria you will need to specify the “lock” option to have results pre-locked</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He says that we should keep optimistic locking ON. </p>

<p>Is there any safe approach of avoiding StaleObjectStateException with lock and optimistic locking ON ?</p>

<p>If I disable optimistic locking (version: false) what other problems can I expect. I'm concerned about this because this domain class is updated from other services ?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

However, there is a bug/challenge/issue with the DrinkPreparationSaga and when it actually gets saved to the database vs. when the PaymentCompleteMessage gets submitted.</p>

<p>How the code works (out of the box, this isn't anything I changed)... The new instance of the saga isn't saved to the database until AFTER the Initial state completes and it transitions to its next state.</p>

<p>The problem is that in the sample Starbucks application the DrinkPreparationSaga starts off with a very slow method that prints out coffee making sounds once every 1 a second 10 times.. </p>

<p>So there is 10 seconds between when the Saga is actually created and when its saved to the database.. The bigger problem with that is, that any other messages that are destined to that instances of the saga (by CorrolationId) are thrown in the error queue because the Saga doesn't exist.</p>

<p>Shouldn't the NHibernateSagaRepository immediately save the new Saga Instance, then run the workflow, then update the saga post workflow?  I can't seem to think of another way to make the example work, but that would require a decent bit of reorganizing in the NHibernateSagaRepository.</p>

        file = new Scanner(new File(teclat.nextLine()));
        s = file.toString();
    }

<p>The problem is, when I run it and type <code>2.txt</code> it brings me this errors: (the file format is correct)</p>

<p>In addition to reading all the obvious documentation, I have looked at these previous questions:  </p>

</ul>

<p>Environment:  </p>

<ul>
<li><code>Centos 6.5</code>  </li>
<li><code>Python 2.6</code>  </li>
<li><code>Django 1.6</code> </li>
</ul>

<p>I am running the following version of apache:  </p>

<pre><code># apachectl -V  
Server version: Apache/2.2.15 (Unix)  
Server built:   Apr  3 2014 23:56:16  
Server's Module Magic Number: 20051115:25  
Server loaded:  APR 1.3.9, APR-Util 1.3.9  
Compiled using: APR 1.3.9, APR-Util 1.3.9  
Architecture:   64-bit  
Server MPM:     Prefork  
threaded:     no  
forked:     yes (variable process count)
</code></pre>

<p>I installed <code>mod_wsgi</code> using Yum and have confirmed it is installed on the server:</p>

<pre><code># httpd -M | grep wsgi 
wsgi_module (shared)
Syntax OK
</code></pre>

<p>My httpd.conf wsgi config snippet is as follows: </p>

<pre><code>#
# Add WSGI configuration
# 

WSGIScriptAlias / /usr/local/django/basic/basic/apache/wsgi.py
WSGIPythonPath /usr/local/django/basic/

WSGIProcessGroup ###.###.###.###

&lt;Directory /usr/local/django/basic/basic/apache&gt;

        Options FollowSymLinks
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    &lt;/Files&gt;
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally my wsgi.py script is:</p>

<pre><code>""""""
WSGI config for basic project.

It exposes the WSGI callable as a module-level variable named ``application``.

For more information on this file, see
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/howto/deployment/wsgi/

import sys

path = ""/usr/local/django/basic/basic/apache""
if path not in sys.path:
     sys.path.append(path)

os.environ.setdefault(""DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE"", ""basic.settings"")

from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
application = get_wsgi_application()
</code></pre>

<p>Output from error log:</p>

<pre><code>[Fri Oct 24 14:10:43 2014] [error] [client (redacted)] Symbolic link not allowed or link target not accessible: /usr/local/django/basic

</code></pre>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The django project is in my user's home directory but has a symbolic link in `/usr/local/django/ pointing to it</li>
<li>In the past when I have worked on projects Error 403 usually meant that the permissions on a file were wrong, but I had check that and the files should all allow the apache user to access them    </li>
<li>My web server works fine when I comment out the wsgi related lines of the Apache config.</li>

This was/is easily done by accessing video memory at 0xB8000 on VGA-equipped PC-compatibles.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today, I decided to try out my old trick through a debug port that gives me access to read physical memory.  To my gratification, it still worked on the first platform I tried it on.  Then, dishearteningly, I discovered that it doesn't work on many other systems.  It seems that the systems it doesn't work on all have UMA (shared-memory) graphics.</p>

<p>So, a question for all of you BIOS writers, low-level OS guys, and video driver gurus - if I'm in regular 80x25 color textmode on a PC-compatible system with shared graphics memory, in real mode, and the contents of 0xb8000 - 0xB8FFF are all 0xFF instead of giving me what's on the screen, where did the screen buffer go?</p>

<p>Because I deployed Cassandra and Opscenter in different Docker containers, I must set <code>listen_address</code> to the container's internal IP (because Cassandra sitting in a container knows nothing about its host) and <code>broadcast_address</code> to the corresponding host's bridge IP.  This is the normal setup if you deploy Cassandra on machines behind separate gateways (like AWS EC2 where each instance has a private and a public IP).</p>

<p><a href=""http://civicactions.com/blog/2009/feb/22/jquerydashboard_plugin#comments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://civicactions.com/blog/2009/feb/22/jquerydashboard_plugin#comments</a></p>

<p>the only problem is that its build around jquery 1.3.2 and I'm stubborn and want to use 1.4.4</p>

<p>The plugin still works with the latest jquery but it looses the functionality to load in the external widget content via the json call.</p>

<p>Well, I take that back it does load the content BUT with now a new exception. The content cannot contain &lt;. >, &amp; or else it will not parse correctly and not load.</p>

<p>In the ajax file for this plugin is this function that I think is the culprit.</p>

<pre><code>// Taken from http://api.drupal.org/api/function/drupal_to_js/7 (GPL 2)
function to_js($var) {
    // json_encode() does not escape &lt;, &gt; and &amp;, so we do it with str_replace()
    return str_replace(array(""&lt;"", ""&gt;"", ""&amp;""), array('\x3c', '\x3e', '\x26'), json_encode($var));
}
</code></pre>

<p>this takes in the data and passes it back, but as of 1.4.4 it won't work, I have no idea why. Is there an alternative way to do this? If i comment out this function then the widgets won't load all together regardless if it contains characters it doesn't like.</p>

<p>As an example:</p>

<p>jquery 1.3.2 parses</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>jquery 1.4+ will only parse</p>

<pre><code>Hello World (if I include the &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; then it won't load)

<p>Edit 5: Changing the dictionary creation from <code>NSDictionary:dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:</code> to <code>NSDictionary:dictionaryWithObjects:forKeys:</code> seems to have fixed all my problems. I'm not entirely certain why, but I'll take it! Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>Also, I have enabled Remote <code>MySql</code> on the server so I can make the connection. I used the '%' wildcard for the meantime because my IP address is dynamic.</p>

<p>my basic c# connection code is as below :</p>

<pre><code>MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlConnection conn;
string myConnectionString;

myConnectionString = ""Server=*******;Database=*******;Uid=******;Pwd=********;"";

        try
        {
            conn = new MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlConnection();
            conn.ConnectionString = myConnectionString;
            conn.Open();
            MessageBox.Show(""connected successfully.."");
        }
        catch (MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlException ex)
        {
            MessageBox.Show(ex.Message);

        }
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, every time I run this code I am getting an error which says
""Unable to connect to any of the specified <code>MySQL</code> hosts"".
I don't' know where the problem is. Is it something on the UNIX server which
blocks the connections or some other thing which I need to do. I am also new to the CPanel interface and how to deal with it.</p>

<p>I appreciate all the help provided.
Many Thanks.</p>

I'm using jQuery 1.10.3 to attempt retrieval of a JSON-encoded object. This request should normally be fulfilled by a php script, which (when visited directly) returns it correctly (at least, to the human eye).
However, when I use a jQuery request to fetch it, I end up with a ton of garbage that jQuery can't parse.
It looks like so:</p>

<p>I have tried 4 tests with identical configuration files, each configuration in different locations.</p>

<p>The tests are finding the xml configurations, parsing them, but strangely, unable to create a bean of type java.lang.Object with the id of ""bar"", failing ONLY when the xml is located in another module.</p>

<p>Granted, I could add config module as a dependency. Regardless, I beg to ask the question: <strong>Why is it finding the xml at all?</strong></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vIBRw.png"" alt=""Line number automatically inserted""></p>

<p>Is there a way for me to set the content in the gutter manually and read the value in it later?<br>
Eg: instead of setting it to 1,2,3... I would want it to look like</p>

<pre><code>A abc
B def
</code></pre>

<p>And then later when I access the line containg ""abc"", I would want to read the value in the gutter of that line which is ""A"".</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>To customize the gutter for Ace Editor, you'll have to override the ""update"" function:</p>

<pre><code>ace.require(""ace/layer/my_gutter"")
//...

define('ace/layer/my_gutter', ['require', 'exports', 'ace/lib/dom'], function(require, exports, module) {

    var dom = require(""ace/lib/dom""); 
    require(""ace/layer/gutter"").Gutter.prototype.update = update = 
        function(config) { 
            //...
        }; 
});
</code></pre>

<p>The function is pretty long and complicated for this small change that I need. So, I didn't go with it.</p>

<p>I found another editor, <a href=""http://codemirror.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">CodeMirror</a> which provides an easier way to do this and have switched over to CodeMirror.</p>

<p>The HTML of my page (in debug mode) renders only the site.css and jquery.jgrowl.css references. If I rename the kendo CSS files and remove the ""min"" part of their name and change the string in my bundle, it works fine. Why can't I reference a .min?</p>

<p>However I don't want to define a new form field, instead I would like to add the localization to my existing model field. This way it isn't working:</p>

<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463028"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463028</a></p>

<p>I have downloaded and installed x64 RTM and x64 SP1 symbols for Windows 7 x64 SP1. Installed on <code>T:\Symbols</code> folder. </p>

<p>But When I debug a 64-bit native C++ application, the symbols would not load at all. For <code>ntdll.dll</code>, for instance, the PDBs are located in:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>T:\Symbols\ntdll.pdb\6192BFDB9F04442995FFCB0BE95172E12</code></li>
<li><code>T:\Symbols\ntdll.pdb\CFF40300FD804691B73E12CF2A150EE02</code></li>
</ul>

<p>But Visual Studio (2008/2010) will not load symbols. While debugging, from Modules View, I select <code>ntdll.dll</code> and say <code>Load Symbols From -&gt; Symbol Path</code>, the specify the <code>ntdll.pdb</code>. For both of mentioned paths, it will always say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A matching symbol file was not found in this folder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have also added this folder (<code>T:\Symbols</code>) in <code>Debugging -&gt; Options</code>, but it will still not load the symbols. While debugging, <code>Load All Symbols</code> button would be enabled, and clicking would not load the symbol either!</p>

<p>For 32-bit the PDB filename would be <code>wntdll.pdb</code> for <code>ntdll.dll</code> and would be stored in GUID-named folders in fashion mentioned above. But VS will not load symbols for 32-bit debugging either. </p>

<p>Quite interestingly (and frustratingly), when I select <code>Load Symbols From -&gt; Microsoft Symbols Server</code>, it will download and <strong>load the symbols</strong> perfectly. It will download the symbols at following location (full path for <code>ntdll</code>):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/uPvzs.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><code>\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp\SymbolCache\ntdll.pdb\6192BFDB9F04442995FFCB0BE95172E12</code></p>

<p>Here you can see the GUID is matching with the GUID-named folder in <code>T:\Symbols</code> path, but for manually installed symbols VS is rigid not to load it! </p>

<p>For NTDLL.PDB, despite the respective folder being same, and the size of PDB also being same, the timestamp might be different. </p>

<p>Sometimes VS would also place symbols in:</p>

<p><code>C:\...\AppData\Local\Temp\SymbolCache\MicrosoftPublicSymbols</code></p>

<p>If VS would download correct symbols ONLY from Microsoft Symbols Server, then what the use of locally downloaded symbols? </p>

<p>My question is basically how to load locally downloaded and installed symbols?</p>

<p>The image needs to not distort regardless of original size but needs to scale down and sit dead centre of the lhc div.</p>

I followed the chosen answer for <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/883270/mstest-problems-with-deploymentitem-attribute"">this question</a> and the file I need copied has its ""Copy to Output Directory"" set to ""Copy Always"".  When I check my ProjectDir\bin directory (the Target directory), the file I want copied is indeed there, alongside the DLLs and PDBs.</p>

<p>I have a couple unit tests with the following setup:</p>

<p>The XSL test fails because when I check MSTest's TestResults\particularTestRun\Out directory, I see the DLLs and the PDBs, but my XSL file is not there.

<p>There is a way to create a sparse matrix in matlab using the sparse command. But I would like to create a sparse <em>array</em>, a 3-dimensional array, is that possible?</p>

<p>I couldn't find anything about it, all that comes up is sparse matrices.</p>

<p>I have to create a page where you can use a graphic interface to select options and then display a finished product.</p>

<p>To simplify just know that there are three variables - top, bottom, color.</p>

<p>Each variable has 3 types. TopStyle1, TopStyle2, TopStyle3 ... BottomStyle1, BottomStyle2, BottomStyle3 ... Color1, Color2, Color3.</p>

<p>So I have an image for each style, so when you select (onClick) TopStyle1. I the image representing TopStyle1 changes to an ""On"" State (just a different image with a gold circle around it indicating your selection) and TopStyle2 and TopStyle3 change to an ""Unselected"" state (images change to grayed out versions of themselves). If you click on TopStyle1 again all there Styles change to an ""Off"" state (their original images).</p>

<p>I found code to do all this, may not be the most efficient way but it works</p>

<pre><code>function topstyle1() {

    if (document.getElementById(""style1-top"").src == ""&lt;%= bse%&gt;images/style1-top-OFF.jpg"") 
    {
        document.getElementById(""style1-top"").src = ""&lt;%= bse%&gt;images/style1-top-ON.jpg"";

        document.getElementById(""style3-top"").src = ""&lt;%= bse%&gt;images/style3-top-DIS.jpg"";

    }
    else if (document.getElementById(""style1-top"").src == ""&lt;%= bse%&gt;images/style1-top-DIS.jpg"")

</code></pre>

<p>At the end of each function, after the images are change I'm trying to set a variable based on which function is called.</p>

<p>So if you click on TopStyle1 you var top=""style1"" ... if you change it to TopStyle2 var top=""style2"" and so on.</p>

<p>After you've chosen your Top, Bottom, and Color there is a button that will say ""View Completed Item."" When you click on this button I want to call a new function that will display an image based on your choices. For now I'd be happy just displaying the text from the variables but I don't know how to get them to show up.</p>

<p>I've tried this:</p>

<pre><code>function changeImage() {
    document.getElementById(""display"").innerHTML=top;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>But I think the contents of the variable are gone when I get to this point.</p>

<p>There has to be a way to set the variable based on my selections and then call them in another function, but my with my inexperience I'm having a hard time finding the answer. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL QUESTION:</strong></p>

<p>I'm taking on the simple task of converting an alphanumeric phone number to a string of digits. For example, 1-800-HI-HAXOR would become 1-800-44-42967. My initial attempt was to create a nasty switch statement, but I'd love a more elegant, and efficient solution. Here's what I've got:</p>

<pre><code>for(char c : inLetters.toLowerCase().toCharArray())
{
    switch(c)
    {
    case '0':                                         result+=""0""; break;
    case '1':                                         result+=""1""; break;
    case '2': case 'a': case 'b': case 'c':           result+=""2""; break;
    case '3': case 'd': case 'e': case 'f':           result+=""3""; break;
    case '4': case 'g': case 'h': case 'i':           result+=""4""; break;
    case '5': case 'j': case 'k': case 'l':           result+=""5""; break;
    case '6': case 'm': case 'n': case 'o':           result+=""6""; break;
    case '7': case 'p': case 'q': case 'r': case 's': result+=""7""; break;
    case '8': case 't': case 'u': case 'v':           result+=""8""; break;
    case '9': case 'w': case 'x': case 'y': case 'z': result+=""9""; break;
    }

<p><strong>Long question:</strong></p>

<p>I just started learning PowerShell from last week and I'm going through each Cmdlets to learn more details. Based on public documentation, we know ForEach-Object can have Begin-Process-End blocks, like this:</p>

<pre><code>Get-ChildItem | foreach -Begin { ""block1"";
    $fileCount = $directoryCount = 0} -Process { ""block2"";
    if ($_.PsIsContainer) {$directoryCount++} else {$fileCount++}} -End {
    ""block3""; ""$directoryCount directories and $fileCount files""}
</code></pre>

<p>Result is expected: 1 time for ""block1"" and ""block3"", ""block2"" is repeated for each item passed in, and dir count/file count are all correct. So far so good.</p>

<p>Now, what's interesting is, the following command also works and gives exactly the same result:</p>

<pre><code>Get-ChildItem | foreach { ""block1""
    $fileCount = $directoryCount = 0}{ ""block2"";
    if ($_.PsIsContainer) {$directoryCount++} else {$fileCount++}}{
    ""block3""; ""$directoryCount directories and $fileCount files""}
</code></pre>

<p>Just 3 ScriptBlocks passed to foreach. Based on manual, the first one goes to -Process (Position 1). But how about the remaining 2? According to manual, there's not a parameter with ""Position 2"". So I turned to Trace-Command, and found that the later 2 script blocks were actually to RemainingScripts as ""IList with 2 elements"".</p>

<pre><code>BIND arg [$fileCount = $directoryCount = 0] to parameter [Process]
BIND arg [System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock[]] to param [Process] SUCCESSFUL
BIND arg [System.Collections.ArrayList] to parameter [RemainingScripts]
BIND arg [System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock[]] to param [RemainingScripts] SUCCESSFUL
</code></pre>

<p>So If I change the command to this:</p>

<pre><code># No difference with/without the comma "","" between the last 2 blocks
Get-ChildItem | foreach -Process { ""block1""
    $fileCount = $directoryCount = 0} -RemainingScripts { ""block2"";
    if ($_.PsIsContainer) {$directoryCount++} else {$fileCount++}},{
    ""block3""; ""$directoryCount directories and $fileCount files""}
</code></pre>

<p>Still, exactly the same result.</p>

<p>So as you noticed, all 3 commands give the same result. This raises the interesting question: both of the later two commands (implicitly) specified -Process, however <strong>ForEach-Object surprisingly ends up using the argument of -Process as ""-Begin""!</strong> (script block is executed once at the beginning).</p>

<p>This experimentation suggests:</p>

<ol>
<li>-RemainingScripts parameter will take all unbound ScriptBlocks</li>
<li>When 3 blocks are passed in, although the first one goes to -Process, later it is actually used as ""Begin"" while the remaining 2 become ""Process"" and ""End""</li>
</ol>

<p>Still, all above are just my wild guess. I didn't find documentation to support my guess</p>

<p>So, finally we go back to my short question :)
Anyone has detailed information on -RemainingScripts parameter of ForEach-Object?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>So here's my questions: is there anything semantically wrong with using <code>DoubleEndedIterator</code> this way? Is there some reason why it would be a bad idea to use it for a purpose that is different from what the documentation says it is for? Also, is there a better way to achieve the same thing?</p>

<p>EDIT:
one this I noticed is the following:
On the edit mode, i.e, when I am at the following url : <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/wizard/edit/1/</code>,
it displays the first form data correctly, and when I click submit, it is not taking me to step-2 of edit mode, i.e the URL changes to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/wizard/create/</code>.</p>

<p>If upon clicking <code>submit</code> on edit url (like <code>/wizard/edit/1</code>) in the first step, same url is maintained then the form would get its initial data in next step. but I cannot figure out how to avoid the url from changing to <code>/wizard/create</code></p>

<p>the form has enctype=""multipart/form-data"" and method=""post"" , i didn't forget that..</p>

<p>the max upload size is 32 meg (and i'm only uploading tiny files).., file uploads is set to ON in php ini</p>

<pre><code>public class Sale 
{
    public int SaleId { get; set; }
    public DateTime CompletedDateTime { get; set; }

    public virtual List&lt;SaleItem&gt; SaleItems { get; set; }

    public decimal Total
    {
       get
        {
            return SaleItems.Sum(i =&gt; i.Price);

    }
}


public class SaleItem 
{
    public int SaleItemId { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public int SaleId { get; set; }
    public virtual Sale Sale { get; set; }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I am now writing some reports which total the sales value for between a specified period. I have the following code to do that:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Sale&gt; dailySales = db.Sales
                          .Where(x =&gt; DbFunctions.TruncateTime(x.CompletedDateTime) &gt;= fromParam)
                          .Where(x =&gt; DbFunctions.TruncateTime(x.CompletedDateTime) &lt;= toParam)
                          .ToList();

decimal total = dailySales.Sum(x =&gt; x.Total);
</code></pre>

<p>This is working ok and giving me the expected result. I feel like this might give me problems further down the line though once large datasets get involved. I assume having to load all the Sale's into a list would become resource intensive, plus my actual implementation has tax, costs etc. associated with each SaleItem so again becomes more complex.</p>

<p>The following would allow me to do all the processing on the database, however it is not possible to do this as the DB does not have a representation for Total, so EF throws an error:</p>

<pre><code>Decimal total = db.Sales.Sum(x=&gt;x.Total);
</code></pre>

<p>Which leads me to my question. I could set me model as the following and each time I add a SaleItem, make sure I update the Total:</p>

<pre><code>public class Sale 
{
    ...    
    public decimal Total { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would then allow me to query the database as required, and I assume will be less resource intensive. The flip side though is that I have reduced redundancy into the database. Is the latter way, the better method of dealing with this or is there an alternative method I haven't even considered that is better?</p>

<ul>
<li>the ajax calls pointing to asyncGetFiles</li>
<li>the call will successfully trigger the download</li>

<p>I have started messing around with the MVVP pattern, and I am having some problems with UI responsiveness versus data processing.</p>

<p>I have a program that tracks packages.  Shipment and package entities are persisted in SQL database, and are displayed in a WPF view.  Upon initial retrieval of the records, there is a noticeable pause before displaying the new shipments view, and I have not even implemented the code that counts shipments that are overdue/active yet (which will necessitate a tracking check via web service, and a lot of time).  </p>

<p>I have built this with the Ocean framework, and all appears to be doing well, except when I first started my foray into multi-threading.  It broke, and it appeared to break something in Ocean...  Here is what I did:</p>

<pre><code>Private QueryThread As New System.Threading.Thread(AddressOf GetShipments)


Public Sub New()
    ' Insert code required on object creation below this point.

    Me.New(ViewManagerService.CreateInstance, ViewModelUIService.CreateInstance)
    'Perform initial query of shipments
    'QueryThread.Start()
    GetShipments()
    Console.WriteLine(Me.Shipments.Count)
End Sub



Public Sub New(ByVal objIViewManagerService As IViewManagerService, ByVal objIViewModelUIService As IViewModelUIService)
    MyBase.New(objIViewModelUIService)
End Sub



Public Sub GetShipments()
    Dim InitialResults = From shipment In db.Shipment.Include(""Packages"") _
                         Select shipment
    Me.Shipments = New ShipmentsCollection(InitialResults, db)
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>So I declared a new Thread, assigned it the GetShipments method and instanced it in the default constructor.  Ocean freaks out at this, so there must be a better way of doing it.</p>

<p>I have not had the chance to figure out the usage of the SQL ORM thing in Ocean so I am using Entity Framework (perhaps one of these days i will look at NHibernate or something too).  </p>

<p>Any information would be greatly appreciated.  I have looked at a number of articles and they all have examples of simple uses.  Some have mentioned the Dispatcher, but none really go very far into how it is used.  Anyone know any good tutorials?</p>

<p>but if I do the mapping manually it takes only less than <strong>10ms</strong> , below is my simple code for calculating the time.</p>

"8713234","1","8715425","","2012-01-03 13:47:30","","4","284","<p>I'm pretty new to Zend Framework. I started learning it during a project I'm still working on for school. I'm a bit stuck on how to tackle an ACL coupled with my modular structure (which I really like), and researching on the internet didn't seem to yield the information I need. It is probably because I'm not very experienced with the framework yet, though, but I still thought I'd ask here. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>At the moment, following most best practices I researched into, I created a modular structure, like so:</p>

<pre><code>application/
  modules/
    admin/
    default/
</code></pre>

<p>I use a plugin to control my ACL, like so (for sake of simplicity/readability I only added a fraction):</p>

<pre><code>$acl = new Zend_Acl();
$acl-&gt;addRole(new Zend_Acl_Role('guest'))
    -&gt;addRole(new Zend_Acl_Role('member'), 'guest');
    -&gt;addRole(new Zend_Acl_Role('admin'), 'member');
$acl-&gt;addResource(new Zend_Acl_Resource('index'));
    -&gt;addResource(new Zend_Acl_Resource('admin:index'));
$acl-&gt;allow('guest', 'index', array('index'));
    -&gt;allow('member', 'index', array('userpanel'));
    -&gt;allow('admin');
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, the ACL is all working fine on the default module - even on the admin module, but the trouble arises when I have identical controller names and actions, for example:</p>

<pre><code>This action will allow users to edit their own account
Module: Default
Controller: User
Action: Edit

This action will allow an admin to edit any account
Module: Admin
Controller: User
Action: Edit
</code></pre>

<p>When I set a rule into the ACL like this:</p>

<pre><code>$acl-&gt;allow('member', 'user', array('edit'));
</code></pre>

<p>The user will also be allowed to access the admin's edit page on the user controller. How do I tell the ACL that there's a difference between modules? I've seen many examples use ""admin:user"" instead of ""user"" as the controller/resource name when adding resources to the ACL. This doesn't seem to work when the controller and/or action names are identical, though.</p>

<p>So - the big question is: how do I solve this problem in my current situation, or how would you suggest I structure my application to avoid the problem all together? I would rather not resort to using additional controller prefixes like ""Admin_AdminUserController"" or just removing the modules all together and just make ""adminEditAction"" etc.</p>

Normal signature to call accessible class method or variable is (Class/Object).(method/variable). Then how do we give System.out.println()? Since System.out only gives the return type but does not belong to same class. Also in servlets, ""this.getServletConfig().getInitParameter(""defaultUser"")"" is not making sense to me, since getServletConfig() and getInitParameter are both member functions of same class, so signature becomes something like, class.method1().method2(), where method1 and method2 are member functions of same class. Can someone please explain..</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>Class CascMethodClassB() 
{ 
public CascMethodClassA methodTest()
{
    CascMethodClassA obj1 = new CascMethodClassA();
    return obj1;
}
} /*Class CascMethodClassB ends*/

Class CascMethodClassA()

public CascMethodClassA()

}

} /*Class CascMethodClassA ends*/


Class CascMethodClassC()

<p>I felt that duplication of version entry (which is 1 in the example given above) does not look very elegant and I tried to use property placeholders like parent.version and project.parent.version but none worked for me - apparently parent.version and project.parent.version are overridden in the children projects of X so maven thinks they are 2, not 1.</p>

<p>The question is whether it is possible to somehow refer to the parent project's version if current root project uses another version than parent project.</p>

<p>I hope the question makes sense as it looks a bit confusing and I don't know how to make it simpler.</p>

<p>I suspect that it is not possible to do what I want by design but I hope that someone with significant maven experience can confirm that.</p>

<p>For the dropdown itself, I am using a code that is pratically the same as <a href=""http://semantic-ui.com/modules/dropdown.html#search-selection"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> code shown in Semantic UI's documentation:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""ui search selection dropdown select-city""&gt;

  &lt;i class=""dropdown icon""&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;div class=""default text""&gt;Select City&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have a service that returns json-formatted cities, then Semantic UI shows in the console that the result was successful with all 261 cities:</p>

<pre><code>""Using specified url""   [""/cities/""]    1648
""Querying URL""  [""/cities/""]    0
""Sending request""   [undefined, ""get""]  0
""Successful API Response""   [Object { success=true, results=[261]}]
</code></pre>

<p>The /cities endpoint return a json formatted as:</p>

<pre><code>{""success"":true,""results"":[{""description"":""Opole"",""data-value"":1},{""description"":""Wrocław"",""data-value"":2},{""description"":""Warszawa"",""data-value"":3},{""description"":""Budapest"",""data-value"":4},{""description"":""Köln"",""data-value"":5}, ...]}
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like that Semantic UI does not directly understand the format of the json.</p>

<p>I've tried many formats of json attributes, even tried to change a bit the html. For instance, tried to add an empty <code>&lt;div class=""menu""&gt;</code> in the bottom of the select, hoping that Semantic UI would fill it in, e.g.,:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""ui search selection dropdown select-city""&gt;
  &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""city""&gt;
  &lt;i class=""dropdown icon""&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;div class=""default text""&gt;Select City&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""menu""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to match the format of the attributes with the ones from the <a href=""http://semantic-ui.com/modules/dropdown.html#search-selection"" rel=""nofollow"">example</a>, e.g., using ""data-value"" attribute.</p>

<p>But it did not work either, I've seen Semantic UI <a href=""https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/master/src/definitions/modules/dropdown.js#L266"" rel=""nofollow"">checks for that</a> in the source code, so it does not make any difference.

It uses window subclassing through the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633591(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>SetWindowLong</code></a> windows API function to override the behavior of the taskbar to prevent users from ever leaving our application or other explicitly allowed applications. </p>

<p>My callback overrides the handling of a few window messages and calls the default handler for other messages. This is done by storing the previous function pointer returned by <code>SetWindowLong</code>, and using it inside of the new function by calling <code>CallWindowProc</code> on it.</p>

<p>Then we had to update the application to be compatible with Windows Mobile 6.5.3, and started having a bunch of problems. I followed <a href=""http://www.hjgode.de/wp/2010/11/18/mobile-development-disable-windows-mobile-6-5-start-and-close-button/"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> to disable the bottom menu buttons which are new on 6.5. On a single application, it works fine and the menu respects my callback. As soon as the user opens up another application through ours, that window seems to be recreated, and I had to devise a mechanism to detect foreground window changes and then ""resubclass"" the window again.</p>

<p>In my code, I don't have control of when exactly this window is recreated, so my first attempt was to use the <code>GetWindowLong</code> function to obtain the current callback address and test it against my own function address. I learned the hard way that I can't just compare the values like that, since <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/4341321/1946412"">it does not always return the function pointer</a>.</p>

<p>Because I'm not able to test if my method is the current handler that way, I end up sometimes setting my method as the handler, and the previous handler is also my own method (in this case, the window was not recreated and thus already had my method set). This results in an infinite loop, since my callback ends up calling itself indefinitely.</p>

<p>How can I know if my custom function is the one being used by a certain window, so that I can avoid this infinite recursion?</p>

<p>I know 80.737 is correct because I have tallied up the records by hand and done the average.  But the average of this table (at 3 decimal places), is 80.56 which is too far off.  Does group by mess with the rounding at each step?</p>

<p>Someone suggested I use OAuth, however my experience with OAuth is limited to setting up a twitter datasource.</p>

<p><strong>What I want to do</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Provide a user an Application ID and a 'secret'</li>
<li>Allow this user to connect to our application via an api endpoint, authorizing themselves using the api ID and secret</li>
<li>Once verified, allow this user to pull only their data from the application</li>
<li>The data that a user can pull: votes they have cast, pledges they have made, purchases they have made, projects/ideas they have launched, data about those projects/ideas (votes/purchases/orders/cancellations etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is OAuth overkill?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a better way to handle a user/users website to connect to our API and pull/verify certain data by using the API we make available, while requiring each incoming request to be authorized for the user/site initiating that request.</p>

<p>Ideally, we will have an endpoint that is accessed as:</p>

<pre><code>https://api.oursite.com/request/params

<p>We want this to be as simple as possible for our users that wish to implement this interface. Thanks for your help!</p>

I have been using the following tutorial <a href=""http://therockncoder.blogspot.ie/2013/09/android-twitter-api-11-app.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://therockncoder.blogspot.ie/2013/09/android-twitter-api-11-app.html</a>. The code seems to work perfectly fine for lots of people but not for me.</p>

<p>I have followed the steps to obtain the consumer key, consumer secret and scree name - however the error below persists. I have researched the problem and someone suggested to change the app permission level (from read only to read/write), however itdid not solve the problem either. I have tried the code with someone else's consumer key, secret and screen name and the code runs just fine.</p>

<p>I am not very familiar with Json or Twitter so I am not entirely sure what is the problem. I am very stuck so any advice would be greatly appreciated! </p>

The data consists of some user details such as real name and email addresse etc. Besides that, I also need to show (and change) the groups which the specific user is a member of, and a list of all available user groups to select additional ones for the user.</p>

<p>The data gets loaded properly and the user details show up as expected. For the group assignment, I created two list boxes. The first one shows the currently assigned groups, the other one shows all existing groups. I want to use two buttons to move a selected item from the ""All Groups"" list to the ""Selected Groups"" list (""Add to selection"") and another one to remove an item from the ""Selected Groups"" list and put it back into the ""All Groups"" list.</p>

<p>Both lists get populated correctly. When I look into my viewModel at runtime, I can see that <code>viewModel.AllGroups()</code> is an observable with a number of <em>group</em> objects in its <code>_latestValues</code> (a group object consists of an <em>Id</em> and a <em>GroupName</em>). I can also properly access them directly, e.g. with a button click for testing that triggers</p>

<pre><code>alert(viewModel.AllGroups()[0].GroupName());
</code></pre>

<p>This gives the right text, so basically everything is in place. But when I try to manually add a group object to <code>SelectedGroups</code> collection, it seems that <code>viewModel.SelectedGroups</code> and <code>viewModel.AllGroups</code> do not have <code>.push</code> or <code>.remove</code> because they are not an observable array but just an observable!?</p>

<p>Here's my JS code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    var viewModel;

    $(function () {

        $.ajaxSetup({ cache: false });

        $.getJSON('/Admin/GetEditWebUserData?Id=@WebUserId', function (data) {
            viewModel = ko.mapping.fromJS(data);
            Selected = viewModel.SelectedGroups();

            viewModel.addToSelection = function () {
                viewModel.SelectedGroups().push({ GroupName: 'Test Group', Id: '123' });
            }

            ko.applyBindings(viewModel, document.getElementById('data'));
        });
    });
&lt;/ script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... and here's the HTML part with the bindings:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""data""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""WebUserGroupEditBox""&gt;
        Member of:
        &lt;select size=""5"" data-bind=""options: SelectedGroups(), optionsText: 'GroupName', optionsValue: 'Id'""&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
        &lt;button data-bind=""click: removeFromSelection""&gt;remove from selection&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""WebUserGroupEditBox""&gt;
        Available groups:
        &lt;select multiple=""multiple"" size=""5"" data-bind=""options: AllGroups(), optionsText: 'GroupName', optionsValue: 'Id'""&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
        &lt;button data-bind=""click: addToSelection""&gt;add to selection&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I click the <em>add to selection</em> button, I get an error telling me that <code>.push</code> does not exist. I think this might me an issue with the mapping. Is there something I can do other than implementing the mapping on my own?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> This is some Json data (sniffed directly from the server response):</p>

<pre><code>{
   ""FirstName"":""Rob"",
   ""LastName"":""Smith"",
   ""UserName"":""rsmith"",
   ""Email"":""rsmith@test.com"",
   ""SelectedGroups"":null,
   ""AllGroups"":[
      {
         ""Id"":0,
         ""GroupName"":""Managers"",
         ""AllowCommands"":true,
         ""AllowParameters"":true
      },
      {
         ""Id"":1,
         ""GroupName"":""Guests"",
         ""AllowCommands"":false,
         ""AllowParameters"":false
      }
   ]
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<p>The problem was not the mapping itself, but the server-side code that constructs the Json data. As nemesv pointed out in his comment, there needs to be an empty array instead of null when there are no items, so that the mapping plugin properly recognizes the structure of the data.</p>

<p>I'd like to create logic that allows the user to display or not display their email address when editing it from a dialog box. I am placing the link that will allow the user to 'opt out' inside the dialog box - and I'm trying to use the link to reset the variable inside the 'if' statement to 'false' The 'if' statement prevents the email address from being rendered. </p>

<p>Here is my if statement:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""change-email"" class=""text""&gt;

        var showEmail = true;

        if (showEmail == true)

        else (showEmail == false)
        {
            &lt;text&gt;&lt;p&gt;No email displayed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/text&gt;
        }

    }
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--#change-email--&gt;

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""dialog-email"" class=""modal""&gt;

    {

    }

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="""" class=""no-display""&gt;Do not display my email address.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>here is the <strong><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/d03ebwdj/"" rel=""nofollow"">jsfiddle demo</a></strong></p>

<p>as you can see it's a normal table but with row grouping, the <strong>green colored ones are the row group,</strong> but there is no way to sort them with a click like I can with the Name and Score column, the only way to sort them is changing the <strong><code>sGroupingColumnSortDirection:</code></strong> to <code>""asc""</code> or <code>""desc""</code> in this code    </p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {
    $('#main').dataTable({
        ""bLengthChange"": false,
        ""bPaginate"": false,
        ""bFilter"": false,
        ""bInfo"": false
    }).rowGrouping({
        sGroupingColumnSortDirection: ""asc"", //this one is repsonsible for the group sortings
        bExpandableGrouping: true
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>that way it works, but the user doesn't have an option or a way to sort the groupings.. </p>

<p>I thought of making a select drop-down, so it will sort the groupings corresponding to what the user selects.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label&gt;
Sort place by:
&lt;select&gt;
  &lt;option value=""place""&gt;Ascending&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=""place""&gt;Descending&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;

<p>I know so far that when I am using <code>typedef struct</code> I can call the content by using name.parameter, and the program seems to be operating correctly when I call <code>first.size</code> the value when need it. But I encounter a problem when I am trying to bitwise because I am asking the value to be broken in bits. Theoretically it should be possible since I have define it as 32 bit, but practically I am missing something extremely small. I tried to assign another value as uint32_t and also as unsigned int size[4] both times not successfully. Can some explain to me the reason and how to solve this problem?</p>

I can't use an <code>initializer_list</code>, since I can't assert its size at compile time, as far as I know.</p>

<h3>What I tried</h3>

<p>My first attempt was using a std::array as a parameter:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;size_t s&gt;
class foo {
  int v[s];
public:
  foo(std::array&lt;int, s&gt;) {/*...*/}
};
</code></pre>

<p>However, that forces me to initialize like this (even when the constructor is not <code>explicit</code>) :</p>

<pre><code>foo&lt;4&gt; a{{1,2,3,4}} // Two brackets.
</code></pre>

<p>I would think there may be some template magic (variadic templates?), but I can't even figure out the proper syntax to use in the constructor. I can't call a constructor recursively... can I?</p>

<p>I tried looking for a definition of the constructor for <code>std::array</code>(since it doesn't allow for more parameters than the size of the array, just what I want), but all I could find is that it has implicit constructors. Is that the default constructors? If so, how does</p>

<pre><code>std::array&lt;int, 3&gt; a = {1,2,3}
</code></pre>

<p>work?</p>

<p>Optional bonus: Why didn't the standard define a fixed size alternative to <code>std::initializer_list</code>? Something like <code>std::static_initializer_list&lt;T, N&gt;</code>. Are there any plans on supporting this kind of functionality in the future? Is it even needed?</p>

<p>The matrix (A) used for testing was a <strong>3d Laplacian</strong> matrix obtained by using the 7 point stencil on a 20x20x20 grid => the matrix is of size 8000 x 8000. This is a <strong>banded</strong> matrix with 7 diagonals.</p>

<p>The RHS (b) was obtained by multiplying A by a vector of 1's. I wanted to solve Ax=b 
by GMRES </p>

<p>For both PETSC and CUSP  I timed only the time taken for 200 iterations of the GMRES solver
(ie time taken for reading in the matrix is not counted) </p>

<p>On Petsc the timings were done with PetscGetTime() and on Cusp with Cuda events.</p>

<p>%--------------------------</p>

<p><em><strong>Timings</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Petsc</strong> (1 cpu) took <strong>0.0558379 sec</strong>  to do 200 iterations of GMRES.</p>

<p><strong>Cusp</strong>          took <strong>0.1183 sec</strong>  to do the same. </p>

<p>%----------------------------</p>

<p>As you can see Petsc is 2.14 times faster than the Cusp library even on a single processor. 
The speed gap gets larger (obviously) on using more than 1 processor.</p>

<p>This experiment was done on a  <strong>GTX 570</strong> card on an <strong>Ubuntu 10.10</strong> running <strong>CUDA 4.0</strong> having <strong>cusp v 0.3.1</strong> and <strong>thrust 1.6.0</strong> </p>

<p>I have read <a href=""http://mgarland.org/files/papers/nvr-2008-004.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> paper by one of the authors of CUSP. <em>However, they have 
not compared the performance of CUSP with Petsc in it.</em></p>

<p>The paper also says that the data-structure used for storing the sparse matrix matters. 
Accordingly they have provided several formats like DIA, ELL, HYB, COO etc. 
but even after I tried them all, the Cusp GMRES performance does not change and still takes 0.1183 seconds for the 200 iterations.</p>

<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/hxgk0aEB"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> is the (quite-short) GPU code on pastebin I used while using CUSP. I am not sure if I am using the Cusp 
library in an optimal manner.</p>

<p>Although it is possible PETSc is still genuinely better than CUSP I want to know if significant speedup is possible with CUSP if used properly.</p>

<p>If more information is needed to answer this question please let me know. 
Thank you.</p>

The only example of application I've seen doing such a thing is AirPaint (<a href=""http://vimeo.com/2276713"">http://vimeo.com/2276713</a>), but it doesn't seems to be able to do it in real time.</p>

<p>My first try is to apply a low-pass filter on the X and Y parameters from the accelerometer, and to make a pointer move toward these values, proportionally to the size of the screen.
But this is clearly not enought, I have a very low accuracy, and if I shake the device it also makes the pointer move...</p>

Do you think accelerometer data is enought to do it ? Or should I consider using other data, such as the compass ?</p>

<p>I have a dataset looking at crime incidents in SF, and I want to sort cases that have a resolution or do not. In the resolution field, cases have things listed like arrest booked, arrest cited, juvenile booked, etc., or none. I want to relabel all the specific resolutions like the different arrests to ""RESOLVED"" and keep the instances with ""NONE"" as such. So, I thought I could gsub or grep for not ""NONE"".</p>

<p>Based on what I've read on finding all strings except one specific string, I would have thought this would work:</p>

<pre><code>resolution_vector = grep(""^(?!NONE$).*"", trainData$Resolution, fixed=TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p>Where I make a vector that searches through my training dataset, specifically the resolution column, and finds the terms that aren't ""NONE"". But, I just get an empty vector.</p>

<p>Does anyone have suggestions, or know why this might not be working in R? Or, even if there was a way to just use gsub, how do I say ""not NONE"" for my regex in R?</p>

<p><code>trainData$Resolution = gsub(""!NONE"", RESOLVED, trainData$Resolution) &lt;&lt;</code> what's the way to negate the string here?</p>

<pre><code>char * __declspec(dllexport) WINAPI test(int x);
</code></pre>

<p>I want to call it in Access VBA like this:</p>

<pre><code>Private Declare Function ""test"" Lib ""MyDLL.dll""(ByVal x As Long) As String

Sub MySub
    Dim s As String
    s = test(1)
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Based on articles found in Google, I wrote a function in the DLL:</p>

<pre><code>BSTR CStrToVBStr(char *str)
{
    int wslen = MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, str, lstrlen(str), 0, 0);
    BSTR bstr = SysAllocStringLen(0, wslen);
    MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, str, strlen(str), bstr, wslen);
    return bstr;
}
</code></pre>

<p>After the call to test(), s apparently contains  Unicode characters. That is, a char * ""test"" is returned to VBA so that Mid(s, 1, 1) = ""t"", Mid(s, 2, 1) = Chr(0), Mid(s, 3, 1) = ""e"", etc. I decide to skip the conversion to Unicode and wrote CstrToVBStr as</p>

<pre><code>BSTR CStrToVBStr(char *str)
{
    return SysAllocString(str);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and ignored the warning that SysAllocString takes an OLECHAR * and not a char * parameter.
The returned string looks good now, but the null character terminator is included, so if the char * is ""test"", then in VBA len(s) = 5 and Right(s,1) = Chr(0).</p>

<p>What is the right way to do what I am doing? All examples that I have seen are about char * as parameters, not return values. I can change test() to be</p>

<pre><code>void __declspec(dllexport) WINAPI test(int x, char *result);

If you have a tab bar app that autorotates, so all the autoresizing masks are set, how do you make it work with all the views? Like if one view autorotates to landscape, you select a different tab in the tab bar, and the view associated with that tab comes up, and its all messed because it never got autorotated, it got initialized with the frame that makes it fit in portrait mode, even though the autoresizingmasks are set to have it look fine in landscape, it never got rotated. Whats the solution? (By the way, I'm lazy loading the views, so the only view loaded at any given time is the view(view controller's view) associated with the selected tab).</p>

A part of it contains content formatted in cryptic pseudo-HTML XML elements which I need to transform into an PDF. That will be done via Apache FOP. Hence I need to access the xml element which contains the content elements directly and pipe it to FOP. To do so the <a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/commons/Digester/FAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">Digester FAQ</a> states that one either</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wrap the nested xml in CDATA</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If this can't be done then you need to use a NodeCreateRule to create a DOM node representing the body tag and its children, then serialise that DOM node back to text</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since it is a third party XML the <code>CDATA</code> approach could only be done via (another) XSLT which I hestitate to do.</p>

<p>It looks like this issue should be solvable via <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/digester/commons-digester-1.5/docs/api/org/apache/commons/digester/NodeCreateRule.html"" rel=""nofollow"">NodeCreateRule</a> but I can not figure out how to get it done.</p>

<pre><code>digester.addRule(docPath + ""/contents"", new NodeCreateRule());
digester.addCallMethod(docPath + ""/contents"", ""setContentsXML"");

<p>setContentsXML expects a Element parameter.</p>

<pre><code>1. Class c(arg);
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>2. Class c = arg;
</code></pre>

<p>are two totally equivalent statements, but look at this situation.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Intermediary {
};

class Left {
  public:
    Left(const Intermediary &amp;) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }   
};

class Right {
  public:
    // The argument is there just so that the example can work, see below
    Right(int) { 
        std::cout &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__  &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

    operator Intermediary () const {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__  &lt;&lt; std::endl;

        return Intermediary();    
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now if I do this:</p>

<pre><code>Left l = Right(0);
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler will complain</p>

<pre><code>error: conversion from Right to non-scalar type Left requested
</code></pre>

<p>But if I do this:</p>

<pre><code>Left l(Right(0)); 
</code></pre>

<p>Then everything compiles and the output is</p>

<pre><code>Right::Right(int)
Right::operator Intermediary() const
Left::Left(const Intermediary&amp;)
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I do this:</p>

<pre><code>Left l = (Intermediary)Right(0);
</code></pre>

<p>then everything compiles again and the output is just like the one above.</p>

<p>So obviously </p>

<pre><code>1. Class c(arg);
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>2. Class c = arg;
</code></pre>

<p>are not the same, but why not, and what's the difference? I couldn't find anything about this online.</p>

<p>Compare it to the explorer ribbon. The window title is centered (and has a different color) and the border size of the window is different. The style of the ribbon isn't the same, but I would be satisfied if I had the same ribbon style as MS Word (wich is displayed correctly in Windows 8).</p>

<p>I have 3 activities: MainActivity, BookActivity, BookChaptersActivity. BookActivity receives some extras to properly initialize. I am using this recommended way to navigate:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
    switch (item.getItemId()) {
    // Respond to the action bar's Up/Home button
    case android.R.id.home:
        Intent upIntent = NavUtils.getParentActivityIntent(this);
        if (NavUtils.shouldUpRecreateTask(this, upIntent)) {
            // This activity is NOT part of this app's task, so create a new task
            // when navigating up, with a synthesized back stack.
            TaskStackBuilder.create(this)
                    // Add all of this activity's parents to the back stack
                    .addNextIntentWithParentStack(upIntent)
                    // Navigate up to the closest parent
                    .startActivities();
        } else {
            // This activity is part of this app's task, so simply
            // navigate up to the logical parent activity.
            NavUtils.navigateUpTo(this, upIntent);
        }
        return true;
    }
    return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However when using Up navigation inside BookChapterActivity, I am getting back to BookActivity, but it gets recreated without extras, so it is complete mess. 
I know that recommended way to solve this issue is by using:
    android:launchMode=""singleTop""
inside manifest. However I don't feel it is proper way to handle this issue. What if I would like to have multiple instances of BookActivity?</p>

<p>So I am asking you: how this situation should be handled properly?</p>

<p>When calling the <code>setState</code> method synchronously in response to an <code>onChange</code> event on an input, everything works as expected. The ""new"" value of the input is already present, and so the DOM is not actually updated. This is highly desirable because it means the cursor will not jump to the end of the input box.</p>

<p>However, when running a component with exactly the same structure but that calls <code>setState</code> <em>asynchronously</em>, the ""new"" value of the input does not appear to be present, causing ReactJS to actually touch the DOM, which causes the cursor to jump to the end of the input.</p>

<p>Apparently, something is intervening to ""reset"" the input back to its prior <code>value</code> in the asynchronous case, which it is not doing in the synchronous case. What is this mechanic?</p>

<p><strong>Synchronous Example</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var synchronouslyUpdatingComponent =
    React.createFactory(React.createClass({
      getInitialState: function () {
        return {value: ""Hello""};
      },

      changeHandler: function (e) {
        this.setState({value: e.target.value});
      },

      render: function () {
        var valueToSet = this.state.value;

        console.log(""Rendering..."");
        console.log(""Setting value:"" + valueToSet);
        if(this.isMounted()) {
            console.log(""Current value:"" + this.getDOMNode().value);
        }

        return React.DOM.input({value: valueToSet,
                                onChange: this.changeHandler});
    }
}));
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the code will log in the <code>render</code> method, printing out the current <code>value</code> of the actual DOM node.</p>

<p>When typing an ""X"" between the two Ls of ""Hello"", we see the following console output, and the cursor stays where expected:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>Rendering...
Setting value:HelXlo
Current value:HelXlo
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Asynchronous Example</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var asynchronouslyUpdatingComponent =
  React.createFactory(React.createClass({
    getInitialState: function () {
      return {value: ""Hello""};
    },

    changeHandler: function (e) {
      var component = this;
      var value = e.target.value;
      window.setTimeout(function() {
        component.setState({value: value});
      });
    },

    render: function () {
      var valueToSet = this.state.value;

      console.log(""Rendering..."");
      console.log(""Setting value:"" + valueToSet);
      if(this.isMounted()) {
          console.log(""Current value:"" + this.getDOMNode().value);
      }

      return React.DOM.input({value: valueToSet,
                              onChange: this.changeHandler});
    }
}));
</code></pre>

<p>This is precisely the same as the above, except that the call to <code>setState</code> is in a <code>setTimeout</code> callback.</p>

<p>In this case, typing an X between the two Ls yields the following console output, and the cursor jumps to the end of the input:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>Rendering...
Setting value:HelXlo
Current value:Hello
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Why is this?</strong></p>

<p>I understand React's concept of a <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components"">Controlled Component</a>, and so it makes sense that user changes to the <code>value</code> are ignored. But it looks like the <code>value</code> is in fact changed, and then explicitly reset. </p>

<p>Apparently, calling <code>setState</code> synchronously ensures that it takes effect <em>before</em> the reset, while calling <code>setState</code> at any other time happens <em>after</em> the reset, forcing a re-render.</p>

<p>Is this in fact what's happening?</p>

<p>I need to write a query that will select all records in Table A and inplace of showing the ID it reaches out to the Group table (B) and pulls back the description. When I try and join all the ID's from Table A to Table B, it inevitably excludes all rows. I only gave a brief layout of Table A, but there are 50+ rows and some have 0 Group_IDs and some have 4 Group_IDs.</p>

<p>Can I do a select statement with embedded select statements?</p>

<pre><code>Select Territory, 
   (Select Group_Description 
    from Territory_Group where Group_ID = Group_ID1) as ""Group1_Description, etc etc

<p>When I show on console the content of <code>div</code> variable, IE shows me nothing.</p>

<p>Instead on Chrome or FireFox, works fine, the element was grab from DOM correctly.
The ID is unique of course, and I try with this ""<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15588478/internet-explorer-10-not-showing-svg-path-d3-js-graph"">internet explorer 10 not showing svg path (d3.js graph)</a>""  but not works.</p>

<p>To complete the scenario, this code is execute into an angularjs directive, but I don't think that's it the problem (but maybe I'm wrong).</p>

<p>As I mentioned this is angularjs app, the html is a chunk of main structure, and is defined as it</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""col-xs-12"" id=""graph_e_p""&gt;

<p>Of course, bootstrap 3.x it's here...</p>

I am able to access the <a href=""http://localhost:8080"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8080</a>.
I need to enable ssl in tomcat without using keystore but have to use openssl.</p>

<p>Used the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 999

openssl x509 -outform der -in cert.pem -out cert.crt

<p>My View hierarchy goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>-&gt; (1) Fragment root view (RelativeLayout)
 -&gt; (2) ViewPager
  -&gt; (3) ViewPager's current fragment view
</code></pre>

<p>When the Fragment that is responsible for the Fragment root view (1) gets hidden (using .hide() in a fragment transaction) and then shown (with .show()), the fragment view that was currently showing in the ViewPager (3) becomes null, although the fragment still exists.  Basically, my ViewPager becomes completely blank/transparent.</p>

<p>The only way I have found to fix this is to call </p>

<pre><code>int current = myViewPager.getCurrentItem();
myViewPager.setAdapter(myAdapter);
myViewPager.setCurrentItem(current);
</code></pre>

<p>after the parent fragment is shown.  This somehow triggers the views to be recreated and appear on screen.  Unfortunately, this occasionally causes exceptions dealing with the pager adapter calling <code>unregisterDataSetObserver()</code> twice on an old observer.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do this?  I guess what I am asking is:  </p>

<p><strong>Why are my fragment views inside my ViewPager getting destroyed when the parent fragment of the ViewPager is hidden?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> this also happens when the application is ""minimized"" and then ""restored"" (by pressing the home action key and then returning).</p>

<p>Per request, here's my pager adapter class:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyInfoSlidePagerAdapter extends FragmentStatePagerAdapter {

    private ArrayList&lt;MyInfo&gt; infos = new ArrayList&lt;MyInfo&gt;();

    public MyInfoSlidePagerAdapter (FragmentManager fm) {
        super(fm);
    }

    public MyInfoSlidePagerAdapter (FragmentManager fm, MyInfo[] newInfos) {
        super(fm);
        setInfos(newInfos);
    }

    @Override
    public int getItemPosition(Object object) {
        int position = infos.indexOf(((MyInfoDetailsFragment)object).getMyInfo());
        return position &gt; 0 ? position : POSITION_NONE;
    }

    @Override
    public CharSequence getPageTitle(int position) {
        return infos.get(position).getName();
    }

    @Override
    public Fragment getItem(int i) {
        return infos.size() &gt; 0 ? MyInfoDetailsFragment.getNewInstance(infos.get(i)) : null;
    }

    @Override
    public int getCount() {
        return infos.size();
    }

    public Location getMyInfoAtPosition(int i) {
        return infos.get(i);
    }

    public void setInfos(MyInfo[] newInfos) {
        infos = new ArrayList&lt;MyInfo&gt;(Arrays.asList(newInfos));

If I moved those two lines of code to the viewDidAppear method (and added tableView reloaddata:), everything worked properly.

if it is an article, then i have to get published journal of the article, published year of the article etc.(there are differences).</p>

<p>so, i want to let user select if it is an article or a book from a dropdown menu first. then related textboxes will be visible. user fills related information and reference 1 is OK. then he will press add button to add another reference,so what he sees first will be dropdown menu first, he selects an option, and related textboxes appear..
here is what i have,</p>

<p>now what happens is, when i select book (1st reference), related textboxes appear, if i change the option to book, book related textboxes appear. there is no problem with first select box. </p>

<p>but, when i press add button, new dropdown menu shows (2nd reference), and i select an option, related textboxes appear again. BUT, the thing is all of the selection changes, including first choices..</p>

<p>However, I am only going to use hands which are > 4200 sq pixels in area, which leaves me with just 621 hands. I realised that this may not be enough &amp; I will look for more images if need be. However, all the images are annotated as follows:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/OsKvh.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I have the coordinates of the bounding box as follows:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/N6Asv.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>However, the bounding box is NOT aligned with the x &amp; y axis. </p>

<p>I believe I have to crop the hands out of the image. I have 2 ways of doing this:</p>

<p>1) let xmin and xmax be minimum and maximum x coordinates of the bounding box. While ymin &amp; ymax are the minimum &amp; maximum y coordinates of the bounding box. If do this, I'll get this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zJnk7.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> (without the bounding box, of course)
basically, some part of the background remains in the above.</p>

<p>2) I can use a binary mask to ""mask' out all the pixels INSIDE the bounding box. If I do this, the size of my image will still be from xmin to xmax &amp; ymin to ymax, however I can set the rest of the background to be white.</p>

<p><strong>What would be better? I believe the positives are supposed to only contain the object of interest (hands in this case), so leaving the background may not be right? However, would a white background be ok?</strong></p>

<p>The main problem here is that the bounding box is not aligned!</p>

<p>I know, it's a lot of useless stuff, but you get the point. What I'm trying to do is as you click on 1, 2, 3, etc., only the content of the div ""mainwrap"" changes, as does the URL (so the page does not refresh, but the URL changes from www.website/1.html to website/2.html, etc. and the content of the one div changes). I have different HTML files for 1, 2, and 3, each with different ""main"" divs, which ideally will be inserted into the ""mainwrap.""</p>

<p>I've tried following along with tutorials like <a href=""https://css-tricks.com/rethinking-dynamic-page-replacing-content/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://css-tricks.com/rethinking-dynamic-page-replacing-content/</a> and other stackoverflow posts like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4002580/how-to-do-partial-page-update-with-jquery"">how to do partial page update with jquery</a>. That second one seems like what I want to do, but when I try to implement it, it still doesn't work. Is there a simple fix that I am just missing because I don't know much about coding? (Also, I'm using Dreamweaver. I don't know if that makes a difference.)</p>

Using the <code>kCGImageDestinationLossyCompressionQuality</code> property you can control the compression quality: <code>0.0</code> being maximum compression and <code>1.0</code> being maximum quality (lossless if possible according to Apple). </p>

<p>I’ve found that there’s a huge jump in both disk size &amp; image quality when you go from <code>0.99</code> to <code>1.0.</code> For example, I’ve got a 2048x1368 image that compresses to 430 KB when the quality is set to <code>0.99</code> but balloons to 2.3 MB when the quality is set to 1.0. There’s a big jump in visual quality as well and the <code>0.99</code> setting isn’t acceptable for this particular image. Trying to set the quality to anything between <code>0.99</code> to <code>1.0</code> doesn’t work as the size remains at 430 KB up until <code>0.995</code> where it jumps up to 2.3 MB. Also, there really isn’t much difference between qualities of <code>0.90</code> to <code>0.99</code> which ranges in file size from ~353 KB to 430 KB, but not much improvement in visual quality.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if there’s any way to increase the JPEG quality? I really need something better than what <code>0.99</code> is giving me but less than what <code>1.0</code> provides. Maybe there’s some other API I could use?</p>

<p>I may try using libjpeg directly but I hope it doesn’t come to that.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>After some investigation it turns out that for all <code>kCGImageDestinationLossyCompressionQuality</code> settings up to <code>1.0</code> Apple uses <strong>4:2:0</strong> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling"">chroma subsampling</a> (or chroma decimation). This means that for the YCrCb image they only sample one chroma pixel (CrCb) for every 4 luminance (Y) pixels. In other words they’re only using 1/4 of the chroma data from the original image. For a quality of <code>1.0</code> Apple uses <strong>4:4:4</strong> chroma subsampling, which is no chroma subsampling or one chroma pixel for every luminance pixel. This is why the file size explodes as the image contains 4x the color data vs. qualities &lt;= <code>0.99</code>.</p>

<p>So, does anyone know if there’s a way to turn off chroma subsampling using CGImage (or any other API) for qualities less than <code>1.0</code>?</p>

<p>Some code may better explain what I am trying to do.</p>

<pre><code>class SuperClass
{
    public boolean isImportant()
    {
        throw customException;
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now say that I have sub classes <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.</p>

<p>I'd like to ensure that this is included in those classes, so like:</p>

<pre><code>class A extends SuperClass
{
    @Override
    public boolean isImportant()
    { 
        return true; //or false
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and class b:</p>

<pre><code>class B extends SuperClass
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now if I do <code>B b = new B(); b.isImportant()</code> I will get the exception.</p>

<p>Instead of having a test for each class (there are many and I may miss some and in the future more subclasses may be added), how can I easily test this.</p>

<p>I am thinking if there is some way to instantiate a object of every subclass.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for(Class subClass : SuperClass.subclasses)
{
   subClass obj = new subClass();
   obj.isImportant();
}
</code></pre>

<p>As this will iterate through all the subclasses, regardless of if some are added or removed and will fail if there is an exception thrown.</p>

<p>Is there some way to do this?</p>

<p>Where the first sequence is X and the second is Y and kmer is the length of the common words. (and when I say word, I just mean characters..) </p>

<p>I was able to create a X by kmer matrix (rather than the huge X by Y) but that's still very slow. </p>

<p>I also thought about using a trie, but thought that maybe it will take too long to populate it? </p>

<p>At the end I only need the positions of those common subsequences.</p>

<p>any ideas on how to improve my algorithm?

The longest DPC fragment ran for 232 milliseconds, the next 5 DPC fragments all ran for over 100 milliseconds, and the next 57 ran between 1 and 90 milliseconds.</p>

<p>Now I got 2 problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The default <code>www.mydomainname.com</code> doesn't automatically add <code>en</code> to URL. Desire result: when I enter <code>www.mydomainame.com</code> it should automatically change to <code>www.mydomainname.com/en</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>When I change the culture. How can I replace the default <code>language segment's value</code> on the route by <code>TwoLetterISOLanguageName</code> of that culture?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Please advice</p>

<p>It seams that problem is in TableOutputFormat. So I checked that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Proper library is in libpath.</li>
<li>Zookeeper quorum and zookeeper port is set in hbase-site.xml</li>
<li>Table wp_json exists in hbase</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the code which is makes problems:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {

    Configuration conf = new Configuration();
    conf.set(""hbase.zookeeper.quorum"", ""zookeeper_server1,zookeeper_server2,zookeeper_server3"");
    conf.set(TableOutputFormat.OUTPUT_TABLE, ""wp_json"");

    String[] otherArgs = new GenericOptionsParser(conf, args).getRemainingArgs();
    String input = otherArgs[0];
    Job job = Job.getInstance(conf, ""ELogHBaseImport"");
    // Input is just text files in HDFS
    FileInputFormat.addInputPath(job, new Path(input));
    job.setJarByClass(ELogHBaseImport.class);
    job.setMapperClass(Map.class);
    job.setNumReduceTasks(0);
    job.setOutputFormatClass(TableOutputFormat.class);
    job.waitForCompletion(true);
}

"32349919","1","32351531","","2015-09-02 09:50:09","","0","36","<p>I am trying to create a view by join two tables together which is by no means difficult. But there is a but.</p>

<p>I basically have two tables. One of them stores associations between items and tags and the other stores tags in parent-child form (8 parents with 4-6 children each).</p>

<p>Allow me to illustrate starting with my item association table:</p>

<pre><code>AssociationId | ItemId | TagId
------------------------------
1             | 2      | 1
2             | 10     | 2
3             | 3      | 1
4             | 5      | 7
...
</code></pre>

<p>And my tags table:</p>

<pre><code>TagId | ParentId | Name
------------------------------
1     | NULL     | abc sds
2     | 1        | sjdksd as
3     | 1        | djfsd dfs d
4     | NULL     | ujkjsd as
...
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see each parent can be found by decorating queries with <code>ParentId IS NULL</code>.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ITA.AssociationId, ITA.ItemId, ITA.TagId, T.Name as TagName
FROM Item_Tag_Association AS ITA
INNER JOIN Tags AS T
ON T.TagId = ITA.TagId
WHERE T.ParentId IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>If I was to join both tables on <code>TagId</code> with <code>ParentId IS NULL</code> I would find all items with parent tags.</p>

<p>If I was to join both tables on <code>TagId</code> with <code>ParentId IS NOT NULL</code> I would find all items with child tags.</p>

<p>But what I actually want is a list of items and tags where child tags are replaced by their parent tags.</p>

<p>Using above example the result would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>AssociationId | ItemId | TagId | TagName
----------------------------------------
1             | 2      | 1     | abc sds
2             | 10     | 1     | abc sds
3             | 3      | 1     | abc sds
4             | 5      | 7     | ysdasjdhas
...
</code></pre>

<p>As for the reason why I want to do this is so that I could get a count of how many times a specific parent tag (or child of that parent) has been associated with an item. And as you guessed it by now each child should contribute to its parent.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT ItemId, TagId, TagName, COUNT(ItemId) OVER (PARTITION BY TagId) AS Count
FROM vw_My_View
ORDER BY Count DESC
</code></pre>

<p>It is my understanding with the modern runtime this will not only synthesize the accessors for my property, but also the instance variable itself, so I could then say in one of this class's methods <code>[stringProperty length];</code> and it would work just as if I'd declared an instance variable.</p>

<p>I've started using this in all my code now, because, well it's one less thing I have to write over and over again. And I've heard with the clang 2.0 compiler, I'll even be able to skip the <code>@synthesize</code> (but that's another matter). But I've been wondering, what are some of the downsides to doing this? When might I truly need an instance variable in addition to my properties?</p>

<p>I know there are sometimes when I want to keep a variable private and not give access to it externally (but then I usually just declare the property in my private class extension, or I don't create a property for it at all, if I don't need accessors for it).</p>

I'm encountering a couple places in my code (only specs, not sure if that's a coincidence) where there are problems with blocks that don't have a variable. Giving them a dummy variable fixes the problem. Here's an example:</p>

<p>In a factory girl factory, this works under 1.8:</p>

<pre><code>Factory.define :thing do |t|
  t.price { 1 - 0.01*rand(10) }
end
</code></pre>

<p>Under 1.9, <code>rand(10)</code> returns <code>nil</code>. Very odd. I was racking my brain for why the environment would be different inside the block. The thing is, <code>rand</code> isn't even from the standard library -- it's from the core language! So there isn't really a way that the environment would make a difference.</p>

<p>Then I remembered that some other places in my specs were breaking because of no-variable blocks, so on a whim I threw one in there, and lo and behold it worked.</p>

<pre><code>Factory.define :thing do |t|
  t.price { |dummy| 1 - 0.01*rand(10) }
end

<p>I thought I do understand boost::bind, but I have trouble with this one.</p>

<p>Does the boost::bind library overload operator&lt; for those two binds, and is returning some kind of function pointer (like a lambda)?</p>

This gets me confused:</p>

<pre><code>boost::bind(&amp;std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;::second, _1)

After that, an Enter key, Esc key or losing focus causes the editing to end, and the TextBox to revert to a TextBlock.</p>

<p>The solution I found is mostly working. My problem is that I'm not able to focus the TextBox upon the ""transformation"", thus forcing the user to explicitly click once more on the element to focus it and start editing.</p>

<h2>Explanation of the code</h2>

<p>The way I chose to implement this behaviour is to work with templates and styles' DataTriggers in order to change the template of the element. In the example I show, the element is a simple ContentControl, althought the real use case in which I'm trying to do this is slighly more complicated (I have a ListBox, where each element is editable through this behaviour, one at a time).</p>

<p>The idea is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ContentControl has an associated Style</li>
<li>The associated Style defines the ContentTemplate as a TextBlock.</li>
<li>The model object has a property, InEditing, which turns to true when I want to edit the control</li>
<li>Through a MouseBinding on the TextBlock I set the InEditing property of the model to True</li>
<li>The Style has a DataTrigger which listens to InEditing, and in this case sets the ContentTemplate to a TextBox</li>
<li>Through EventSetters I catch Enter, Esc and LostFocus in order to revert save the changes and revert back to the previous style. Note well: I can't directly attach events to the TextBox, otherwise I get a <em>The event  cannot be specified on a Target tag in a Style. Use an EventSetter instead.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Although not optimal (there's a certain mix of view and model behaviours - especially in the InEditing property - and I don't like to substantially re-implement the commit logic of changes to the model of the TextBox through the various handlers for KeyDown and LostFocus), the system actually works without problems.</p>

<h2>Failed implementation idea</h2>

<p>At first I thought of connecting to the IsVisibleChanged event of the TextBox, and set the focus in there. Cannot do it, because of the beforementioned <em>The event  cannot be specified on a Target tag in a Style. Use an EventSetter instead.</em></p>

<p>The solution suggested by the error cannot be used, because such an event is not a routed event, and thus cannot be used in an EventSetter.</p>

<h2>The code</h2>

<p>The code is split in four files.</p>

<p>some researches bring me to this explanation from Apple documentation</p>

<pre><code>Using the sandbox SSL identity to try to connect to the production environment will return an error like this:

<p>From the same documentation another explanation is that, and i think it apply more in this case, because i send a lot of push notifications during development of app:</p>

<pre><code>Another possibility is that you've connected too many times to APNs and further connections have been temporarily blocked. As is documented in the Local and Push Notification Programming Guide, developers are expected to open a connection and leave it open. If a connection is opened and closed repeatedly, APNs will treat it as a denial of service attack and block connections for a period of time.

This temporary block will expire if no connection attempts are made for about one hour

<p>Can someone tell me if this means i must to change the provisioning profile in xCode, create another file .pem (key+cert), contact Apple, etc ?</p>

<p>I have three simple delegates, and three simple functions ... No problem here, everything compiles as expected, and will not compile if I accidentally try to link delegate A with Method B etc (wrong number of parameters).</p>

<p>What I'm struggling to understand is why the anonymous functions seem happy to be linked to all three of the named delegates</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo
{
   public delegate void del_TestWithNoParams();
   public delegate void del_TestWithThreeInts(int x, int y, int z);
   public delegate void del_TestWithIntPtr(IntPtr ptr);

   public void DoStuff()
   {
      //All OK so Far ... Code will not compile if I mix these up
      del_TestWithNoParams d1 =
         TestWithNoParams; d1();
      del_TestWithThreeInts d2 =
         TestWithThreeInts; d2(2, 4, 8);
      del_TestWithIntPtr d3 =
         TestWithIntPtr; d3(new IntPtr(0x1234567));

      //Why do these compile
      del_TestWithNoParams d4_nocompile =
         delegate { Console.WriteLine(""AnonymousDel d4""); };
      del_TestWithThreeInts d5_nocompile =
         delegate { Console.WriteLine(""AnonymousDel d5""); };
      del_TestWithIntPtr d6_nocompile =
         delegate { Console.WriteLine(""AnonymousDel d6""); };

      // Edit 1 goes here
   }

     public void TestWithNoParams()
     { Console.WriteLine(""NoParams""); }
     public void TestWithThreeInts(int x, int y, int z)
     { Console.WriteLine(""Ints: {0},{1},{2}"", x, y, z); }
     public void TestWithIntPtr(IntPtr ptr)
     { Console.WriteLine(""IntPtr: 0x{0:X8}"", ptr.ToInt32()); }

 }
</code></pre>

<p>Also (just to give you a complete runnable app...)</p>

<pre><code>static void Main(string[] args)
  {
     var f = new Foo();
     f.DoStuff();
     Console.WriteLine(""Done""); Console.ReadLine();
  }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit 1: Using Lambda Methods</strong>  </p>

<pre><code> //This work as expected - and fail to build if I get the parameter-count wrong.
 del_TestWithNoParams d7 =
   (() =&gt; Console.WriteLine(""Lambda NoParams""));
 del_TestWithThreeInts d8 =
   ((a, b, c) =&gt; Console.WriteLine(""Lambda Ints: {0},{1},{2}"", a, b, c));
 del_TestWithIntPtr d9 =
   ((ptr) =&gt; Console.WriteLine(""Lambda IntPtr: 0x{0:X8}"", ptr.ToInt32()));
 Test(d7, d8, d9);
</code></pre>

<p>Simple Helper Function:</p>

<pre><code>private void Test(del_TestWithNoParams del_A, del_TestWithThreeInts del_B, del_TestWithIntPtr del_C)
{
   del_A();
   del_B(2, 4, 8);
   del_C(new IntPtr(0x1234567));
}
</code></pre>

<p>... Would you agree that this is a <strong>better</strong> method to write the same code ???</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit #2 - Summary of Answers</strong></p>

<p>I realise that (whichever way I write the code), the generated IL byte-code is still Type-Safe..</p>

<p>As with many things in C#, named-delegates, anonymous delegates, and lambda methods each have their own place, and there is a balance between ""code-readability"", ""compiler-expansion-of-code"" and the suitability for the individual application being written.</p>

<p>The replies below have helped answer the question, and show that the compiler is really doing something similar to the following.</p>

<p>1 - It will NOT allow me to make this mistake  </p>

<pre><code>//del_TestWithIntPtr d_mistake_A =
//   delegate(int x,int y,int z) { Console.WriteLine(x + y + z); };
</code></pre>

<p>2 - The ""compiler inferring the types"" is expanding the delegate (e.g. d5_nocompile) out to  </p>

<pre><code>del_TestWithThreeInts d_clearer_3P =
delegate(int x, int y, int z) { Console.WriteLine(x + y + z); };
</code></pre>

<p>3 - It is POSSIBLE to make a mistake (which is still valid code)</p>

<pre><code>del_TestWithThreeInts d_EasyToMakeMistake =
delegate { Console.WriteLine(""Oops - forgot to do anything with params""); };
// (this is really :- delegate (int x, int y, int z) {...} )
</code></pre>

<p>4 - However, when re-written as a lambda expression, it is slightly more obvious when looking through the code later (or to another developer)</p>

<pre><code>del_TestWithThreeInts d_LessEasyToMakeMistake =
((x, y, z) =&gt; Console.WriteLine(""Still POSSIBLE to make mistake, but more obvious""));
</code></pre>

<pre><code>module Zone = struct
 type t = 
 { ...
   prop: bool }
 ...
end

modules Zones = struct
  type t =
  | ZSbot
  | ZS of Zone.t list
  | ZStop
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>A principle file <code>all.ml</code> uses <code>Zones</code> and <code>Mis</code> modules,  <code>mis.ml</code> contains functions which work on both <code>Zone.t</code> and <code>Zones.t</code>, for instance <code>val Mis.make : Zone.t -&gt; Zones.t</code>.</p>

<pre><code>open Zones
open Mis
type t = { zs: Zones.t }
...
Mis.make z
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I would like to have more options for the <code>prop</code> of <code>Zone</code>. So I define an interface <code>PROPERTY</code> and 2 modules <code>Type</code> and <code>Formula</code> matching it, so that I can make functors for <code>Zone</code> and others where <code>... prop: Property.t ...</code>. Now I can imagine several possibilities for the new <code>all.ml</code>:</p>

<pre><code>(* 1 *)
open Zones
module ZonesType = ZonesFun(Type)
module ZonesFormula = ZonesFun(Formula)
type t = { zstype: ZonesType.t; zsformula: ZonesFormula }

(* 3 *)
open Zones
module ZonesType = ZonesFun(ZoneFun(Type))
module ZonesFormula = ZonesFun(ZoneFun(Formula))
type t = { zstype: ZonesType.t; zsformula: ZonesFormula }

(* 4 *)
open Zones
module ZoneType = ZoneFun(Type)
module ZoneFormula = ZoneFun(Formula)
module ZonesType = ZonesFun(ZoneType)
module ZonesFormula = ZonesFun(ZoneFormula)
type t = { zstype: ZonesType.t; zsformula: ZonesFormula }
</code></pre>

<p>Although the signatures of <code>ZonesFun</code> and <code>ZoneFun</code> are different among the 3 options, this implementation can make sure <code>ZoneXXX.t</code> and <code>ZonesXXX.t</code> are coherent. Now one big problem is how to change <code>Mis</code>:</p>

<p>1) If I make a functor <code>MisFun: PROPERTY -&gt; MIS</code>, and build the <code>ZoneXXX</code> and <code>ZonesXXX</code> inside. It cannot know <code>MisXXX.Zone.t</code> is same as <code>Zone.t</code> of <code>all.ml</code>, or <code>MisXXX.Zones.t</code> is same as <code>Zones.t</code> of <code>all.ml</code>.</p>

<p>2) If I make a functor <code>MisFun: Zone -&gt; Zones -&gt; MIS</code>, it cannot know <code>MisXXX.Zone.t</code> and <code>MisXXX.Zones.t</code> are coherent.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to solve both 1) and 2)?</p>

<p>The app gets the file name and link correctly. How can I copy the content and save it to a string variable?</p>

<h1>Fail Scenarios</h1>

<p>If a <strong>System A</strong> <em>client</em> of <strong>version 1</strong> calls a <strong>System B</strong> <em>service</em> of <strong>version 2</strong> it can fail on: </p>

<ul>
<li>missing methods on <code>SystemBObject</code> (<code>getYear()</code>, <code>getMonth()</code>, <code>getDay()</code>)</li>
<li>Unknown type <code>BDate</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If a <strong>System A</strong> <em>client</em> of <strong>version 2</strong> calls a <strong>System B</strong> <em>service</em> of <strong>version 1</strong> it can fail on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unknown type <code>BDate</code> on the <code>SomethingFromBRequest</code> (A client uses a newer B request object that B version 1 doesn't recognize)</li>
<li>If the System A client is smart enough to use version 1 of the request object, it can fail on missing methods on the <code>SystemBObject</code> object (<code>getDate()</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If a <strong>System B</strong> <em>client</em> of <strong>version 1</strong> calls a <strong>System A</strong> <em>service</em> of <strong>version 2</strong> it can fail on: </p>

<ul>
<li>Type missmatch or overflow on <code>SystemAObject</code> (returned <code>Long</code> but expected <code>Integer</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If a <strong>System B</strong> <em>client</em> of <strong>version 2</strong> calls a <strong>System A</strong> <em>service</em> of <strong>version 1</strong> it can fail on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type missmatch or overflow on <code>SystemARequest</code> (request <code>Long</code> instead of <code>Integer</code>)</li>
<li>If the request passed somehow, casting issues (the stub is <code>Long</code> but the service returns an <code>Integer</code> not nessecarily compatible in all WS implementations)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Possible solutions</h1>

<ol>
<li>Use numbers when advancing versions: e.g. <code>SystemAObject1</code>, <code>SystemBRequest2</code> etc but this is missing a an API for matching source / target version </li>
<li>In the signature, pass XML and not objects (yuck, pass escaped XML in XML, double serialization, deserialization / parsing, unparsing)</li>
<li>Other: e.g. does Document/literal / WS-I has a remedy? </li>
</ol>

ATM I'm able to have password resets sent to the user inputted email, but the component is missing a function that checks against existing users to see if the email is valid. I'm rather new to PHP, so I'm not 100% sure how to introduce an additional if statement.</p>

<p>Here's how's it looking so far:</p>

<pre><code>public function submitemail() {
    $db = JFactory::getDBO() ;
    $requestedEmail =   JRequest::getVar('emailaddr' , '') ;
    $db-&gt;setQuery('select id , username, name, email from #__users where block = 0  and email = ""'.$requestedEmail.'""') ;
    if( $user =  $db-&gt;loadObject() )  {

        // Make sure the user isn't a Super Admin.
        $juser = JFactory::getUser($user-&gt;id) ;
        //joomla 1.6 and 1.5 check  
        if ($juser-&gt;authorize('core.admin') || $juser-&gt;usertype == 'Super Administrator') {
            $this-&gt;setRedirect( 'index.php?option=com_resetpassword'  , 'Email is not valid' ) ;        
        }
        else {          
            $result = $this-&gt;sendPasswordResetEmail( $user ) ;
            $this-&gt;setRedirect( 'index.php?option=com_resetpassword&amp;layout=success'  //, 'Please check your email and follow the instructions to reset your password ' 
                ) ;
        }
    }
    else {
        $this-&gt;setRedirect( 'index.php?option=com_resetpassword'  );
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I happened across a related post where I found this snippet. How would I go about checking against email addresses that are currently in my database against the user inputted email for the reset?</p>

<pre><code>function validate()
{ jimport('joomla.mail.helper');
$valid = true;

     $valid = false;

<p>I created a similar 'endorsed' directory in both the JDK &amp; JRE lib directory. I copied all the jars from JAX-WS 2.2.5 (a total of 23 jars) into the endorsed directory.

<p>This code works great if your application has only one form.  You call <code>Application2.Run(myOnlyForm)</code> on it and all messages get routed through the filters in Application2.</p>

<p>However if at any point you call <code>mySecondForm.ShowDialog()</code> that dialog does not get its messages filtered through Application2.</p>

<p>Is there any way (with out bad side effects) to get the messages on <code>mySecondForm</code> to go through the `Application2' event filters?</p>

<p>I have tried:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Changing <code>mySecondForm.ShowDialog</code> to <code>Application2.Run(mySecondForm)</code>.<br>
<ul>
<li>This causes the window to not clean up when it goes out of scope and to not show when needed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Changing <code>mySecondForm.ShowDialog</code> to <code>Application2.ShowDialog(mySecondForm)</code>.<br>
<ul>
<li>This causes the main menu on <code>mySecondForm</code> to not work (clicking has no effect, just beeps).
<ul>
<li>This seems like the one I should be using, but I kind of need to have menus on my screens.  It seems that this is a <a href=""http://community.opennetcf.com/forums/p/7660/7660.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">common</a> <a href=""http://www.ureader.com/msg/14286075.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">problem</a> with OpenNETCF.</li>
<li>The menu item is not broken.  Using the hot key for the menu still works.  Just tapping the menu does not work. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Changing <code>mySecondForm.ShowDialog</code> to <code>Application2.ShowDialog(mySecondForm, true)</code> (true = clean up the dialog box).<br>
<ul>
<li>This this does not work because I need access to the dialog box after it closes some times.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Ideally I would like a way to attach a form to the message abilities of Application2.</p>

<p>But I welcome any suggestions.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:
Based on the suggestion for ctacke this is what I have done:</p>

<pre><code>public static DialogResult ShowDialog2(this Form form)
{
    //form.Activated += InsertMenu;
    //Application2.ShowDialog(form);
    form.Show();
    try
    {
        do
        {
            Application2.DoEvents();
        } while (form.Visible);
    }
    catch (ObjectDisposedException)
    {
        // This just means that the form was closed.  Not a big deal.
    }
    return form.DialogResult;

}
</code></pre>

<p>I end up calling ShowDialog2 rather than ShowDialog</p>

"21789093","1","","","2014-02-14 20:37:13","","1","139","<p>Given the class below that has a class instance variable <code>@v</code> that is assigned a default value and is accessible via class methods and also via instance methods, how would I convert this into a module that can be included into other classes?</p>

<pre><code>class C
  @v = ""default value of #{self} class instance variable""
  class &lt;&lt; self; attr_accessor :v end 
  def v= val; self.class.v = val end 
  def v; self.class.v end 
end
</code></pre>

<p>The module needs to have a class instance varable that gets a default value and have both class and instance accessor methods in order to fully answer the question. It would be especially helpful if answers could demonstrate a module that is structured for use with <code>include</code> as well as a module structured for use with <code>extend</code>. </p>

<p>My attempt at an <code>include</code> module is shown below</p>

<pre><code>module M
  def included(c)
    class &lt;&lt; c
      @v = ""default value of #{self} class instance variable""
      ## This did not work
      # class &lt;&lt; c.class
      #   attr_accessor :v
      # end
      def v= val; @v = val end 
      def v; @v end 
    end
  end
  def v= val; self.class.v = val end
  def v; self.class.v end
end

class C
  include M
end
</code></pre>

<p>This almost works the same as the original class, but there are a couple of exceptions that I am aware of:</p>

<ul>
<li>The variable's default value is not set in the class, and</li>
<li>I was unable to get <code>attr_accessor</code> to work in the module (so I replaced with manual methods)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a similar module that is set up to be used to <code>extend</code> a class; it has the same issues (so I have tried this both ways - using <code>include</code> and <code>extend</code>). I have other modules that use <em>class variables</em> but are otherwise similar to the above and these work fine (accepting the fact that inherited classes share the class variable).</p>

<p><hr>
Here is a block of test code:</p>

<pre><code>puts ""the default values of class instance variable""
puts C.v
puts ""----""

# set new values
C.v = ""this is C's class instance variable""
puts ""new values assigned to class instance variable""
puts C.v
puts ""----""

# create subclasses
class D &lt; C
end
class E &lt; C
end

puts ""the subclasses' class instance variable won't have a value""
puts D.v
puts E.v
puts ""----""

# give them values
D.v = ""this is D's class instance variable""
E.v = ""this is E's class instance variable""
puts ""new values assigned to subclass class instance variable""
puts C.v # untouched

puts E.v
puts ""----""

# instances
d1 = D.new
d2 = D.new
e1 = E.new
e2 = E.new

<p>My problem is the URL's I'm getting look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrBTzoAL7RVc9sAXT9XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByOHZyb21tBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1437900673/RO=10/RU=http%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fSomething/RK=0/RS=wtfzdVploHxkh.UDtV9YvqVD56w-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrBTzoAL7RVc9sAXT9XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByOHZyb21tBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1437900673/RO=10/RU=http%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fSomething/RK=0/RS=wtfzdVploHxkh.UDtV9YvqVD56w-</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I need, is just the URL for the site and not the Yahoo search side of it. I've been told this is possible through PHP uses a function like this:</p>

<pre><code>function translateurl($line) { 
$c=""0123456789abcdef"" ;
for ($a=0;$a&lt;16;++$a) { for ($b=0;$b&lt;16;++$b)
$tr[""%"".$c[$a].$c[$b]]=chr(($a*16)+$b) ; }
$a=explode(""http"",$line) ; $b=explode(""/"",$a[2]) ; $u=""http"".$b[0]; 
$url=strtr($u,$tr) ; return $url ; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've been able to convert all of it to Ruby except for the section that's:</p>

<pre><code>$tr[""%"".$c[$a].$c[$b]]=chr(($a*16)+$b)
</code></pre>

<p>I kind of understand how this is working, but I feel like this should be easier in Ruby with Selenium. At the moment, my only work around for this is to just open the link in a new tab and take the URL from there. But it takes a lot of time to do so and would just be easier to convert the URL without opening the link.</p>

<p>My current Ruby code:</p>

<pre><code>def translate_url(url)
       c='0123456789abcdef'
       for a in 0..16
         for b in 0..16
           tr = ['%' + c[a] + c[b]]
           tr((a*16)+b).ord
         end
       end

       a = ('http' + url).split(', ')

       b = ('/' + a[2]).split(', ')

       u = ('http' + b[0])

       return_url = strtr(u,tr)
       return_url
end
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>This function eventually times out on task.Result.

<p>Is this a problem with my implementation or a bug in Xamarin.Mobile? I would like to continue with Xamarin.Mobile, but I'm not opposed to reverting back to native implementation.</p>

<p>The problem with the above is that I can either search by firstname OR lastname, but not both (e.g. ''John Smith'' is not possible while ''John'' or ''Smith'' is possible. 
This is happening because of the orOperator and I can not see any andOr or something similar.</p>

<p>So e.g. if I have ""John Smith"" inside my database, I can find him by querying either ""John"" , ""Smith"" , ""John Smith"" (just as in facebook for example)</p>

<p>Just to point this out, the matrix I'll be running this operations are somewhat big, it has 20 million non-zero elements so efficiency is very important!</p>

<p>I appreciate your help!</p>

class HighScore

<pre><code>HighScores GameScores;

{
    base.Initialize();
    GameScores = new Highscores();
}

<p>Surely the objects shouldn't be null if I made them as <code>new</code>?</p>

<p>[EDIT]</p>

<p>OK so I've made a new function within the class HighScores to initialise the MyScores objects as new HighScore objects:</p>

<pre><code>public void InitScores()
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
    {
        MyScores[i] = new HighScore();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which is called within <code>protected override void Initialize()</code> (I'm sure you're all familiar with it, it's standard in XNA). I also have added the same code in the class function: <code>GameScores.SortHighScores</code> to initialise <code>TmpScores</code>.</p>

  equal to that value. Since it is not easy to extract and manipulate
  all URL links contained in responses, generally the work of adding the
  parameters to each link is done by the back-end generating the
  content. In some cases it might be feasible doing this via the web
  server using mod_substitute or mod_sed. This can have negative impact
  on performance though.</p>

<p>I send the following request 10 times in postman:</p>

<pre><code>https://{{myserver}}/doc?jsessionid=node1
</code></pre>

<p>I notice that the requests are passed to <code>node1</code> (5 requests) and to <code>node2</code> (also 5 requests). But I define the stickysession so it should choose <code>node1</code>, and go to this node every time.</p>

<p>My goal is that the client will send the request <code>https://{{myserver}}/doc?jsessionid=nodeX</code>, and the request will pass to <code>nodeX</code> (<strong>without using cookie..</strong>, only using stickyness is URL encoding). </p>

<p>For example, the client sends the request <code>https://{{myserver}}/doc?jsessionid=node1</code> 10 times. Every 10 times the request will be served by <code>https://localhost:5006</code>.</p>

<p>What I do wrong?</p>

<p>There is one problem I can think of with impersonation... I can only impersonate one user per application domain I <em>think</em> but I'm happy to be corrected. I may need to write this file to several different shares which means I may have to impersonate several users.</p>

<p>Running monodevelop from a shell using <strong>sudo monodevelop</strong> runs absolutely fine.  I've purged all (and I do mean all) the mono packages and re-installed but the error persists.  The packages I'm installing are from the mono package repository as outlined <a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>It would seem to be a permissions issue but I can't for the life of me work out what folder or file could be causing this.  I've spent the last 2 days trying to figure this out and have got absolutely nowhere at all, so if anyone has any ideas or has come across this problem before, I'd love to hear about it.</p>

<p>I am trying to make a program that recreates a bit map image using a limited colour palette.  I naively thought that I could simply find the squared difference of the Red/Green/Blue values and use that to quantify the squared difference between colours. However in practice this doesn't seem to work very well, shades of red are being matched to shades of purple and so on.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions of alternate comparison methods I could use?</p>

<pre><code>int squaredDistance(colour a, colour b)
{
    return (a.r - b.r)*(a.r - b.r) + (a.g - b.g)*(a.g - b.g) + (a.b - b.b)*(a.r - b.b);

<p>ImagesController.php:</p>

<pre><code>var $paginate = array(
            'limit' =&gt; 9,
            'order' =&gt; array('Image.id' =&gt; 'desc')
            );     

public function index() {  
  $data = $this-&gt;paginate('Image');
  $this-&gt;set('images', $data);
}
</code></pre>

<p>index.ctp:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;Paginator-&gt;sort('id', 'Id'); ?&gt; | 
&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;Paginator-&gt;sort('name', 'Title'); ?&gt;
...
&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;Paginator-&gt;prev(' &lt;&lt; Previous', null, null, array('class' =&gt; 'disabled')); ?&gt;
&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;Paginator-&gt;numbers(array('first' =&gt; 2, 'last' =&gt; 2)); ?&gt;
&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;Paginator-&gt;next('Next &gt;&gt; ', null, null, array('class' =&gt; 'disabled')); ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works great. Now, when you click on a thumbnail a single image will be displayed using a view named 'view' (e.g. localhost/gallery/images/view/1). Like the index view, this view should have a pagination too, where the image with the id of 1 is currently selected and where you can navigate to the n previous and next images relative to the currently selected one. Moreover the images should be sorted by the same criteria as the pictures on the index view (e.g. by name). Is there an elegant way to solve this problem with CakePHP?</p>

I am using  <code>jQuery.ajax</code> for <code>GET</code> and on success setting  hidden <code>iframe</code> <code>src</code> to <code>url</code>, which gives me a pop-up for file download. And its working fine in all browsers.
Now I want to change a custom request headers to encrypt file before GET &amp; download. I used  <code>jQuery.ajax</code> pre-request callback function <code>beforeSend</code> for it.  </p>

<p>I am able to GET my encrypted file which I can observe in firebug but my <code>iframe</code> still shows non encrypted file for download. After inspecting I can say that <code>iframe</code> requesting a new GET .</p>

<p><strong>Code</strong></p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
url: ""/tutorial.text"",
beforeSend: function(xhr) {  xhr.setRequestHeader(""PASSWORD_HEADER"", userPwd);  },
success: function() {   $(""#Hidden_iframe"").attr(""src"", this.url);  }                                   
});
</code></pre>

<p>And this is working good on Internet explorer. How can i force iframe to use the available resource rather than requesting new GET.
Or How can I <strong>setRequestHeader</strong> in iframe or do I really need a <code>jQuery.Ajax</code> for this task is there any best way to download the Content-Disposition header being set to attachment files directly from server.</p>

I have a VS2010 Solution and added a WiX (Votive) Project to make a Setup. I am building this Setup on a TFS Build Server. Unfortunately all my Files (*.dll, *.sql, *.msi, *.whatever) are blindly copied into the same Output-Path! I have added a msbuild target with a Move-Task to my Setup.csproj file, to move my msi, bat and sql files into a seperate folder, but unfortunately this doesnt work on TFS-Build.</p>

<p>Here is the Problem (imho):
What i do in Votive is a Stage to early. i can make Folders and move the Files, but what i write in the csproj file is done before the TFS randomly take all binaries and puts them into the drop location.</p>

<p>How i tried to solve:</p>

<ol>
<li>I searched the wix2010.targets file for a move or copy command where <em>.</em> is moved to build_drop but i wasnt able to find it.</li>
<li>I looked at Build process template but i have no idea of the language or syntax. Is there something to do with it?</li>
<li>In the Build defintion in Build Defaults theres the checkbox ""This build copies output files to a drop folder"" where i have to add my drop location. Is there something i can change here?</li>
</ol>

<p>My Question:
How can i create Subfolders with a WiX Setup file and move certain files into it on a TFS Build?</p>

<p>Any help or insight would be appreciated.</p>

<p>update:</p>

<p>Colin's answer almost works but isn't quite right.</p>

<p>Colin's regex does match ""Child"" and ""child"" and not match ""another child"" like I asked. There are a few problems though.</p>

<p>What I am trying to do is match on ""Child"" and ""child"" so they can be  replaced with either the child's name or the correct pronoun he/she, depending on the child's gender.</p>

<p>The problem with Colin's regex is that it matches "", child"" and "". Child"". Is also doesn't match ""Child"" if that is the first word in the text. For example:</p>

<p>""Child went to the park. In the park, child plays. Child is tall. Child watches another child at play.""</p>

<p>The first Child does not match. The subsequent matches are on "", child"", "". Child"", and "". Child"".</p>

<p>I worked on the regex that Colin came up with trying to get it to just match ""child"" or ""Child"" but can't make it work.</p>

<p>G. Ken Holman answered:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unless the vendor of your XSLT processor gives you an extension to request this, it is out of your hands. Such serialization choices are made by the processor and cannot be specified in an XSLT stylesheet using standardized mechanisms. A processor may offer this, but I haven't seen it (not that I've gone looking ... from an XML perspective, the resulting information set is unchanged regardless of the attribute delimiter chosen).</p>

<p><strong>Q1:</strong> Is it possible to output single quotes with LibXslt in PHP?</p>

<p><strong>Q2:</strong> If Q1 is Yes, then is it possible to output per-attribute basis? (eg: I want only some attributes to be rendered with single quotes).</p>

<li>Doing the rest of the video to see if it could at least works</li>
<li>Running the installer again (it runned completely fine, like if it was first time, but did no stuff). On the first try I got that same error, but lately I haven't got it again</li>

<p>What I wonder is, is it possible to have a function that returns something which as far as I know means that the return value/function is on the stack and pass the result to a function which takes a reference?</p>

<p>With my limited knowledge I would say no, but thats just a feeling that I have, and I've learned to never trust my feelings when it comes to programming.</p>

When I debug my application using Visual C# on my laptop, the video is stretched to fit the container's dimensions i.e. the aspect ratio of the video is not maintained. When I load and run my application on a different computer (same operating system), the <code>aspect ratio</code> is maintained and black bars are created on the screen.</p>

<p>I <strong>do not</strong> want the aspect ratio to be maintained. I want the other computer to display the video the same way my computer is displaying it.</p>

<p>Why do you think the two computer's act differently and/or how do I fix this?</p>

<p>When I first saw this behaviour on the other computer, I updated that computer's <code>DirectX</code> to no avail. The exact same videos are being run on both systems.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT #1:</strong> Could it possibly be some missing <code>filter</code> on the other computer? I assumed the default behaviour of <code>DirectShow</code> was not to maintain the <code>Aspect Ratio</code>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT #2:</strong> When I attempted to use <code>IVMRWindowlessControl</code> (<code>VMR-7</code> &amp; <code>VMR-9</code>), the cast from the VMR to the <code>IVMRWindowlessControl</code> kept on resulting in a <code>NULL</code> variable. As a result I tried <code>IVMRAspectRatioControl</code> with <code>VMR-7</code> and it worked on one of the computers. The other computer stayed in Letterbox mode despite the call to remove the Aspect Ratio preservation.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT #3:</strong> Here is the code using <code>IVMRAspectRatioControl</code> with <code>VMR-7</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int hr = 0;

this.graphBuilder = (IGraphBuilder)new FilterGraph();

this.vmr = new VideoMixingRenderer();

this.graphBuilder.AddFilter((IBaseFilter)vmr, ""VMR"");

this.aspectRatioControl = (IVMRAspectRatioControl)this.vmr;

hr = this.aspectRatioControl.SetAspectRatioMode(VMRAspectRatioMode.None);
DsError.ThrowExceptionForHR(hr);

hr = this.graphBuilder.RenderFile(filename, null);
DsError.ThrowExceptionForHR(hr);  
</code></pre>

<p>I am then using <code>IVideoWindow</code> to display the video.</p>

<p>When attempting to use the <code>IVMRWindowlessControl9</code>, the <code>this.windowlessControl</code> evaluated to <code>NULL</code> after the <code>cast</code> on the 4<sup>th</sup> line. I get the same <code>NULL</code> error when I tried it with <code>VMR-7</code>. The following uses <code>VMR-9</code>:</p>

<pre><code>this.graphBuilder = (IGraphBuilder)new FilterGraph();

this.vmr = new VideoMixingRenderer9();

this.graphBuilder.AddFilter((IBaseFilter)vmr, ""VMR"");

this.filterConfig = (IVMRFilterConfig9)vmr;

hr = this.filterConfig.SetNumberOfStreams(1);
DsError.ThrowExceptionForHR(hr); 
hr = this.filterConfig.SetRenderingMode(VMR9Mode.Windowless);
DsError.ThrowExceptionForHR(hr);  

this.windowlessControl = (IVMRWindowlessControl9)this.vmr;

hr = this.windowlessControl.SetAspectRatioMode(VMR9AspectRatioMode.None);
DsError.ThrowExceptionForHR(hr);

hr = this.graphBuilder.RenderFile(filename, null);
DsError.ThrowExceptionForHR(hr);  
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not entirely sure how it works, but could it be possible that the second computer does not support <code>VMR-7</code> for the <code>IVMRAspectRatioControl</code>? The operating systems on both computers are the same, however the first computer (which works) is where I'm writing the software (it has the IDE). The second computer had a fresh install of <code>Windows</code>. On the second computer, I also updated <code>DirectX</code> as mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>loadArrays() is just method that converts from SharedPreferences to String Array. Activity2 saves the new data in SharedPreferences and than Activity1 can read it (with the new data).
If I return to the ""main activity"" (it is not Activity1) and than come back to Activity1 - the new data is shown, but I want this data will be updated when I return from Activity2 immediately. </p>

It's meant to work like the QStackedWidget, but with the requested widget dropping down from the top and ""pushing"" the previously visible widget out of sight.
This works more or less but I am seeing strange behaviour (such as offsets to the contained widgets and discrepancies in behaviour depending on which widgets are being added) which is causing me grieve in my main code.</p>

<p>After several coffees I realized that this ""PageAnimator"" should really be a layout manager rather than a widget, as it is only responsible for placing (and animating) other widgets.</p>

<p>Below is the code for my (still slightly dodgy) PageAnimator widget which I would like to turn into a proper layout manager, as that seems more logical to me.</p>

<p>Below the widget is the new layout manager code I managed to come up with so far. This actually seems to work ok, except for the fact that the widgets are drawn outside of the layout's geometry and I would like to make sure that they are only visible inside of it. In other words, the layout's geometry needs to become the ""viewport"" for the widgets.</p>

<p>I have implemented the solution mentioned there but under certain rare circumstances where a thread times out, the program can still fail / lock up (see: Keep the main() method open, and prevent further cron runs of the program).</p>

<p>Here's the source I'm using:</p>

<pre><code> //Iterate through the array to submit them into individual running threads.
    ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(12);
    List&lt;Future&lt;?&gt;&gt; taskList = new ArrayList&lt;Future&lt;?&gt;&gt;();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; objectArray.length; i++) {
        Future&lt;?&gt; task = threadPool.submit(new ThreadHandler(objectArray[i], i));
        taskList.add(task);
        Thread.sleep(500);
    }

    //Event handler to kill any threads that are running for more than 30 seconds (most threads should only need .25 - 1 second to complete.
    for(Future future : taskList){
        try{
            future.get(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        }catch(CancellationException cx){ System.err.println(""Cancellation Exception: ""); cx.printStackTrace();

        }catch(InterruptedException ix){ System.err.println(""Interrupted Exception: "");ix.printStackTrace();
        }catch(TimeoutException ex) {future.cancel(true);}
    }
    threadPool.shutdown();
    threadPool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is:  with this code implemented, why is the executor service not cutting things off at 30 seconds.</p>

<p>and my code to parse</p>

<pre><code>        SELECT 
            T.c.query('.')
            ,T.c.value('(@version)','nvarchar(250)')as [version]

<p>The first 2 columns return all as expected, the full XML text, and the [version] value.
However, CN.c.query('.') is simply NULL.</p>

<p>I know it's something to do with the namespace because it works just fine is I strip all namespace concerns from the XML file and SQL.</p>

<p>Googled a lot ... but still struggling to grasp the concept of what is wrong.</p>

<p>I have been working with many frameworks, especially on Windows like <code>WinAPI</code>, <code>WinForms</code>, <code>WPF</code> and know, that there is problem when creating custom components like <code>Lists</code> that display a lots of items using composition from already existing components (e.g. generating thousands of labels in the table to display list view). </p>

<p><strong>My question is how well does Clutter perform with that?</strong></p>

<p>Does it have some scene virtualization that will render only the necessary items in the viewport? </p>

<p>Does it have some composition layer that can handle high composition of Actors? </p>

<p>And by that, I mean an <code>Actor</code> containing a texture, three text actors and another two actors representing some buttons (probably also composed) and all this in some king of repeater. </p>

<p>I was unable to find any materials concerning this and don't have time to experiment on this so I am desperately looking for some advice.</p>

Goal is to take the entire first row of data, which is the column name, then take the entire row of data from the row where the first column matches the name specified in the code. These two rows should then be linked to each other, so they can be displayed in a dynamic image.</p>

<p>However, to avoid excessive requests from the external data source, the data is only downloaded once a day by saving it into a json file. The previous day's data is also kept, to perform a difference calculation.</p>

<p>What I'm stuck on is...well, it's not working as intended. The dynamic image does not display and says it cannot be displayed because it contains errors, and the files aren't being created properly.

<p>And here is what the data looks like when it is saved:</p>

<pre><code>""{\""teamName\"":{\""Folding@HomePos\"":\""51\"",\""Folding@HomeScore\"":\""9994.405407\""},\""date\"":\""2014-03-14 11:00:00\""}""
</code></pre>

<p>I've omitted most of the data because it just makes things excessively long, and it helps to see the format. Now the reason why its an unexpected output is because I didn't expect trailing slashes to be in it. The older version of this code would output like this:</p>

<pre><code>{""teamName"":{""Asteroids@HomePos"":""192"",""Asteroids@HomeScore"":""7647.783251""},""date"":""2014-03-14 11:00:00""}
</code></pre>

<p>So the expected behaviour is to to gather the data from the aforementioned rows in each tab delimited text file, copy the old data into the 'old' data file (vaultDataold), save the new data into the 'current' data file (vaultData), and then display the data from the 'current' file in a dynamic image, along with performing a 'new' minus 'old' calculation on the two files to show the change since the previous day.</p>

<p>Most of this code should work, as I've had it working before in a different way. The issue likely lies somewhere with gathering the row data and saving it, most probably the latter. I'm guessing the slashes are causing the issue.</p>

<pre><code>Book.where(where).joins(join).order(order).limit(10)
</code></pre>

<p>But sometimes we don't want to return a book. I just wanted to use this syntax to make a query that returns an array of maps, with the fields on select, without bounding it to any entity. Is it possible? Is there a magial Default class, on which I can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>Default.select(select).from('book').where(where).joins(join).group(group).order(order)

<p>It would be nice to keep the standard acrross the code, even in reports that do not relate to entities.</p>

<p>Normally I do it in the from table entity, but that has some drawbacks: once I specify the exact fields I want in select, I end up with a corrupted, incomplete entity. Also, it seems to always return the id in the .to_json. It would be nice to get just an array of maps.</p>

<p>Array of maps is just an arrray, but instead of objects is has maps inside:
[ {id: 12, name: 'Luan'}, {id: 42, foo: 'Bar'} ]
Note that I don't want to use the Book entity because I am not returning a Book: I am returning certain columns from multiple tables being joined, for a particular purpose, that are not being represented by a single entity. That is why I wanted to return an array of maps, and, in particular, do not use the Book class or any other entity class.</p>

<p>I've got a <code>base.html</code> template:</p>

<pre><code>[...]
&lt;body&gt;
{% block content %}
{% endblock %}
&lt;/body&gt;
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>there's <code>index.html</code> template that displays a JS slider (it's content reside in <code>body</code> tag directly):</p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""base.html"" %}

{% block content %}
// some javascript/css slider stuff here
{% endblock %}
</code></pre>

<p>and there are some dynamic content pages: <code>list.html</code>, <code>form.html</code>, etc (their content shall reside in some <code>div</code> containers). I define <code>container.html</code> somehow like the following:</p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""base.html"" %}

{% block content %}
&lt;div class=""container marketing""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""container""&gt;
        {% put overriden ""content"" block here %}
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
{% endblock %}

<pre><code>{% extends ""container.html"" %} # note what I'm extending here!

{% block content %}
this is my list
{% endblock %}

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>I want to keep my base template as generic as possible (e.g. to enable client-side slider - with no <code>div</code> containers). And I want to wrap most of my dynamic pages (list, form, etc.) in the same HTML container code. Since I don't want to repeat this code, this should be available in one template (a template to be extended by list, form, etc).</p>

<p>I know I could define another block inside. But maybe there is a better solution?</p>

I have been reading a lot on how to optimize  queries and how to properly use indexes but even after implementing changes I thought would work, little improvement can be seen. My quick fix has been simply to use only the top 100,000 rankings (updated daily and stored in a different table) to improve the speed for now, but I really don't like that option.</p>

<p>So I have a table that stores the information for users that looks something like:</p>

<p>table 'cache':</p>

<pre><code>id    (Primary key)
name
region
country
score
</code></pre>

<p>There are other variables being stored about the user, but I don't think they are relevant here as they are not used in the rankings.</p>

<p>There are 3 basic ranking pages that a user can view:</p>

<p>A world view:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT cache name,region,country,score FROM cache ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 0,26
</code></pre>

<p>A region view:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT name,region,country,score FROM cache WHERE region='Europe' ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 0,26
</code></pre>

<p>and a country view:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT name,region,country,score FROM cache WHERE region='Europe' AND country='Germany' ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 0,26
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried almost every combination of indexes I can think of to help alleviate work for the database, and while some seem to help a little bit I can't find one that will only return 26 rows for both the <strong>region and country queries</strong>(with simply an index on 'score' the world rankings are blazing fast).</p>

<p>I feel like I might be missing something basic, any help would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>Little extra info: the cache table is currently around 920 megabytes with a little more than 800,000 rows total. If you could use any more info just let me know.</p>

<p>Today all pages are in form of </p>

<pre><code>http://www.domain.com/locality/id-name-of-the-shop.html

<p>Of course the important is the ID, but the locality and name of the shop have some form of ""slug"" to bypass problem of accented chars (à / è / ì) / umlaut / etc.</p>

<p>We cannot mantain ""old style"" of links, so I think:</p>

<p>1 - in htaccess first of all I make 301 redirects to .html version to our ""no-extension"" version ( <code>http://www.domain.com/locality/id-name-of-the-shop</code>  )</p>

<p>2 - Sure several link will be different, the links with the accented chars (I presume about the 10-15% of total links). So I'll have two links for same content (e.g. <a href=""http://www.domain.com/locality/832"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.domain.com/locality/832</a>-metrò and <a href=""http://www.domain.com/locality/832-metro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.domain.com/locality/832-metro</a> ). Or, more difficult   <a href=""http://www.domain.com/l+aquila/5482-name-of-the-shop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.domain.com/l+aquila/5482-name-of-the-shop.html</a> and <a href=""http://www.domain.com/l-aquila/5482-name-of-the-shop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.domain.com/l-aquila/5482-name-of-the-shop.html</a></p>

<p>This (for me) drama because I'm using a framework with his slug engine, very powerful, and I would no modify / extend this. Neither I cannot surfing for 7000 pages and write down by hand the redirects :)</p>

<p>having worked through what is happening I understand that at compile time gcc adds placeholders for the call to get_pc_thunk and __udivdi3 since it does not know at that point where __udivdi3 will be, and it might need to be called via a lookup table. However after linking the get_pc_thunk is no longer needed. I have looked through the linker options and cannot find one that will optimize this call out.</p>

so that i get the text coordinates of the text within a rectangle. the rectangle coordinates are extracted using the itextsharp.dll.
Basically i get the rectangle coordinates from itextsharp.dll, where itextsharp uses the coordinates system as lower left. And i get the pdf page text from PDFBOX, where PDFBOX  uses the coordinates system as top upper left.
I need help in converting the Coordinates from lower left to upper left</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p><strong>Updating my question</strong></p>

<p>Pardon me if u dint understood my question and if not full information was provided..</p>

<p>well, Let me try to give more details from start.</p>

<p>I am working on a tool where i get a PDF in which a rectangle is drawn using some Drawing markups within a comment section. Now i am reading the rectangle coordinates using iTextsharp</p>

<pre><code>PdfDictionary pageDict = pdReader.GetPageN(page_no);
PdfArray annotArray = pageDict.GetAsArray(PdfName.ANNOTS);
</code></pre>

<p>where pdReader is PdfReader.</p>

<p>And the page text along with its coordinates is extracted using PDFBOX. where as i have a class created pdfBoxTextExtraction in this i process the text and coordinate such that it returns the text and <strong>llx,lly,urx,ury</strong> ""line by line"" please note line by line not sentence wise.</p>

<p>So i want to extract the text that lays within the Rectangle coordinates. I got stuck when the coordinates of the rectangle returned from itextsharp i.e llx,lly,urx,ury of a rectangle has an origin at <strong>lower left</strong> where as the text coordinates returned from PDFBOX has an origin at <strong>upper left</strong> .then i realised i need to adjust the y-axis so that the origin moves from lower left to upper left. for the i got the height of the page and height of the cropbox</p>

<pre><code>iTextSharp.text.Rectangle mediabox = reader.GetPageSize(page_no);
iTextSharp.text.Rectangle cropbox = reader.GetCropBox(page_no);
</code></pre>

<p>Did some basic adjustment </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>lly=mediabox.Top - lly</p>
  
  <p>ury=mediabox.Top - ury</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in some case the adjustment worked, whereas in some PDFs needed to do adjustment on cropbox</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>lly=cropbox .Top - lly</p>
  
  <p>ury=cropbox .Top - ury</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where as on some PDFs dint worked.</p>

<p>All i need is help in adjusting the rectangle coordinates so that i get the text within the rectangle</p>

<p>Hope this is clear enough.If not please pardon me and ask for the same</p>

<p>Thank You</p>

<li>I used else if concept </li>
<li>I have not used try catch finally concept   webdriver element finding using elseif loop  </li>

<p>how I want it to work :  </p>

<ol>
<li>First it will check for ""if"" condition that is <code>[if(driver.findElement(By.xpath(""username"")).isDisplayed())]</code>  and if it is not found it will not print any statement.  </li>
<li>because ""if"" condition is not seen it will go to ""elseif"" condition that is <code>[else if(driver.findElement(By.id(""username"")).isDisplayed())]</code> and as ""else if"" statement is true, it will print and do what ever is there in loop..<br>
let me know on above statemnts does my below code works or not...  </li>

Now I am having the same problem, but this time I need to run some basic 128 bit arithmetics (sums, bitshifts and multiplications) on a 32 bit embedded system (Intel Edison) that does not support 128 bits of any kind. There are, however, 64 bit integers supported directly (unsigned long long int). </p>

<p>I tried naively to use the asm code that was answered to me last time on the CPU, but I got a bunch of errors. I am really not experienced with asm, so: what is the most efficient way, having 64 bit integers, to implement additions, multiplications and bit shifting in 128 bits?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>and so on. There are various pages (like location) for various editions (like NY). I use URLconfs like</p>

<pre><code>url(r'^(?P&lt;edition&gt;[\d]+\-[\w]+)/$', views.home),
url(r'^(?P&lt;edition&gt;[\d]+\-[\w]+)/location/$', views.location),
</code></pre>

<p>In each of the views I have to fetch the current edition. The fact is, if the edition name is wrong, I want to redirect to the latest edition. So I do something like</p>

<pre><code>def home(request, edition):
    try:
        event = Edition.objects.get(name=edition)
    except ObjectDoesNotExist:
        return redirect(home, edition=Edition.latest())
    # If event was found I go on here

def location(request, edition):
    try:
        event = Edition.objects.get(name=edition)
    except ObjectDoesNotExist:
        return redirect(home, edition=Edition.latest())
    # If event was found I go on here
</code></pre>

<p>and so on. Of course there is some duplication that I'd like to minimize. I can think of two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>use <code>get_objects_or_404()</code> and customize the 404 view, or</li>
<li>abstract the common part in a function.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem with both ways is that they do not allow me to do a proper redirect, that is, the URL will remain the same even if the view was changed. Is there a better way to handle these redirects?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> It seems my question is not clear. In particular it is not clear what I mean by abstract the common part in a function. So, what I <strong>could</strong> do is the following</p>

<pre><code>def get_edition_or_current(edition):
    try:
        event = Edition.objects.get(name=edition)
    except ObjectDoesNotExist:
        event = Edition.latest()
    return event

def home(request, edition):
    event = get_edition_or_current(edition)
    # I go on with a valid event here

def location(request, edition):
    event = get_edition_or_current(edition)
    # I go on with a valid event here
</code></pre>

<p>In this way I can display the view for a proper event, but I cannot change the URL. To change the URL, the view must return a redirect. I cannot set the return value for the view from inside <code>get_edition_or_current</code>.</p>

<p>So, how does Django implements <code>get_object_or_404</code>? Well, it is simple, it raises an Http404 exception, and catches it later. But of course this only works for Http404 exceptions, because Django is instructed to catch them.</p>

<p>I´ve been reading about SPI communication an GPIO also, but I still have some doubts.</p>

<p>Can I use the SPI ports and the GPIO to both control and connect the touchscreen to the board?
in this case, Is ""everything included"" on raspbian? (Let me explain that) if you use the standard HDMI, my JVM will interact with raspbian to control the screen (as a standard computer screen) and the same with the touch events coming from the USB. But, as I´m not using these ports, Will I need any special libraries to be installed on raspbian? and of course, Are any?</p>

<p>The main problem is that I've found some libraries on c (for certain screens) but I will like to use java. If not, I will try to implement any kind of ""system calls-like"" interface with both java for the apps and c for the events and screen drawing.</p>

<p>Does all the things that I´m typing make sense? </p>

<p>Thanks a lot. I will appreciate any help.  </p>

<pre><code>sp_my_proc: result = 3; error = 0

<p>and it crashes (""program.exe has stopped working etc"" on Windows 7). I am using devcpp, but my file is named with C extension. Can anyone help me in fixing this char* to char* content copy? I need a function to make that because I need to copy content of one string to another many times in my C file. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>p.s.: what I have already tried in <strong>copy_leaf</strong> function (desperate solutions):</p>

<ul>
<li>changing <strong>leaftype source</strong> to <strong>const leaftype source</strong> (that'd be a <strong>const char* source</strong>)</li>
<li>making <strong>*destiny = strcpy(*destiny,source)</strong>, as strcpy returns a pointer to the destination string</li>
</ul>

However, I am not updating the git contents and should only be potentially reading/pulling in changes from the host.
It appears that when I came to make my first push of my main Hg repo it baulked at the Git one asking for a password. I think this may be because its attempting to authenticate against the Git site as well.
My questions are can I arrange this so that the Git repo is read-only(pull) or even static and/or get round the log in issue. Obviously the two different repos have different credentials.
Thanks.

<p>I've just re-read this;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.6. Synchronizing in subrepositories</p>
  
  <p>Subrepos don't automatically track the latest changeset of their sources. Instead, they are updated to the changeset that corresponds with the changeset checked out in the top-level changeset. This is so developers always get a consistent set of compatible code and libraries when they update.</p>
  
  <p>Thus, updating subrepos is a manual process. Simply run 'hg pull' and 'hg up' in the target subrepo, test in the top-level repo, then commit in the top-level repo to record the new combination. The onsub extension can be used to automate that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assume this means its not pulling the sub? but I still have the above issue of the password request.</p>

I must define a function called <code>treeNodeCount()</code> which returns the number of nodes in a binary tree (easy enough), and I also have to define an overloaded function that takes an int(0,1, or 2) which represents the number of children, and the function should return the nodes that have that specific number of children.
<code>treeNodeCount</code> should both use a function called <code>nodeCount(elemType root)</code> to do the recursion necessary to count the nodes(so basically all the work).</p>

<p>challenge number one says that I can add a second parameter to <code>nodeCount</code> which takes the number of children for the nodes that we want to count.</p>

<p>Challenge number two says that we cannot use a second parameter (this is the tough part)</p>

<p>I was able to do challenge one and here is what I came up with:</p>

{

    if (p == NULL){

    }

    else if (a == 0 &amp;&amp; p-&gt;lLink == NULL &amp;&amp; p-&gt;rLink == NULL){
        return 1 + nodeCount(p-&gt;lLink, a) + nodeCount(p-&gt;rLink, a);
    }
    else if (a == 1 &amp;&amp; (p-&gt;lLink != NULL ^ p-&gt;rLink != NULL)){
        return 1 + nodeCount(p-&gt;lLink, a) + nodeCount(p-&gt;rLink, a);
    }
    else if (a == 2 &amp;&amp; p-&gt;lLink != NULL &amp;&amp; p-&gt;rLink != NULL){
        return 1 + nodeCount(p-&gt;lLink, a) + nodeCount(p-&gt;rLink, a);
    }

    else if (a == -1){
        return nodeCount(p-&gt;lLink, a) + nodeCount(p-&gt;rLink, a) + 1;

}
    return nodeCount(p-&gt;lLink, a) + nodeCount(p-&gt;rLink, a);
}

template &lt;class elemType&gt;

<pre><code>clf=RandomForestClassifier (n_estimators=800, criterion='gini', n_jobs=12, max_depth=None, compute_importances=True, max_features='auto', min_samples_split=1,  random_state=None)
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p>

<p>Using the above link's examples, I set up an ""XML variable"" in the EventTrigger/ValueQueries section (which I named ""EventInfo""), </p>

<pre><code>&lt;Triggers&gt;
  &lt;EventTrigger&gt;

<p>and referenced it in the Actions/Exec/Arguments field of a scheduled task. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;Actions Context=""Author""&gt;

<p>Using the command-line utility <code>eventcreate</code>, I ran tests with sample data (none of which was a single character), and there was no issue; the scheduled task's command (a small batch file to simply write the args passed to a log file) showed everything was coming thru perfectly/as-expected. </p>

<pre><code>eventcreate /L application /so triggerTestEvent /id 101 /t INFORMATION /d ""TEST #1""
</code></pre>

<p>However, I've encountered an issue when the data in the event is a <strong>single character</strong>. </p>

<pre><code>eventcreate /L application /so triggerTestEvent /id 101 /t INFORMATION /d ""1""
</code></pre>

<p>When this case is run, the variable replacement doesn't occur, and the ""XML variable"" string, <code>$(EventInfo)</code>, is passed to the batch file, unchanged, and printed. I've tested with alphabetic vs. numeric vs. punctuation. Any single character causes the failure, but when the character is doubled, the value comes thru perfectly.</p>

<p>I've googled to no avail. I'm trying to find out if the issue is with me, or is it an actual bug in Scheduler's parsing of the event's XML.</p>

<p>Raw is the measurements input. Multiple measurements can happen on the same observation date (i.e. multiple rows).</p>

<p>Summarized is what I'm hoping to get out. Rows are summarized and the 'm'easurement columns merely indicate that the value (following the M, i.e. M1, M2) was observed on the day in any of the V columns. For example, the number 2 was seen on the first and last observation on 5/16, but the number 5 was not seen in any of the 9 values on 5/16.</p>

<p>I think I need to use a join but how to calculate the M columns escapes me.</p>

<p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>

<p>Question: is there a name for this type of operation in data science or mathematics?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:
I'm trying the following</p>

<pre><code>setkey(raw,Date)
s &lt;- data.table( Date=unique(raw$Date)) # get a datatable of the unique dates
setkey(s,Date)
s[raw, M1:=(length(na.omit(match(c(raw$V1,raw$v2,raw$v3),1)))&gt;=1)]
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the values are not what's expected for 5-4 (should be FALSE). I think this is becuase the raw rows are not being constrained in my match statement.</p>

<pre><code>         Date   M1
1: 2013-05-04 TRUE
2: 2013-05-09 TRUE
3: 2013-05-16 TRUE
4: 2013-05-30 TRUE

<pre><code>namespace N {
    extern ""C"" void f();
}

void g() {
    N::f();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code declares an external function with C linkage inside a namespace. This makes possible to refer to such a function from a private namespace, avoiding the resulting namespace pollution caused by an ordinary global external declaration. It also allows client code to issue other (hopefully compatible) declarations for the same function without conflicts, even in the global namespace, possibly originated from a vendor-provided header inclusion.</p>

<p>I often rely on similar constructs in both C and C++ to isolate compilations from bad-written or conflicting header files provided with some libraries. (In C, this is achieved by issuing the needed declarations at function scope, which would be also possible in C++, if not for the <code>extern</code> linkage declaration being not allowed at function scope.) This is specially useful for properly linking against a well-defined ABI without having to rely on vendor-provided header files.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to do the same with functions or methods with regular C++ linkage?</strong> That is: to declare an external function with C++ linkage inside a private namespace (or at any sort of local scope), but which possibly refers to a function actually defined inside <em>another</em> namespace?</p>

<p>Intended functionality (pseudo-code):</p>

<pre><code>namespace N {
    // Actually should link with P::f() (and not N::f()).
    extern ""C++"" void f();
}

void g() {
    N::f(); // P::f();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This obviously is not a problem for source files (as opposed to header files), because namespace pollution does not matter in that case. Thus, this question refers mostly to isolating declarations in library header files (for use inside templates and inline functions).</p>

<p>Compiler-specific solutions are welcome (MSVC and GCC being of interest).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> suppose my library is called <code>Lib1</code> and I want to declare everything inside the <code>Lib1</code> namespace.</p>

<pre><code>// Lib1.hpp
namespace Lib1 {
    class Class1;
    void func1();
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now suppose my library refers to another library, <code>Lib2</code>, which is a C library provided by someone else.</p>

<pre><code>/* Lib2.h */
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern ""C"" {
#endif

struct Struct2;
void func2();
/* ... */

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>In my library, I can refer to entities from <code>Lib2</code> without having to include <code>Lib2.h</code> at all, if for some reason this is needed:</p>

<pre><code>// Lib1.hpp
namespace Lib1 {
    extern ""C"" void func2();

    inline void inlineX() {
        func2();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>At the same time, a client code is free to include both <code>Lib1.hpp</code> and <code>Lib2.h</code> (considering it is C++-friendly) without conflicts.</p>

<p>Now, suppose there is a third library, <code>Lib3</code>, which is a C++ library and declares entities in the <code>Lib3</code> namespace.</p>

<pre><code>// Lib3.hpp
namespace Lib3 {
    class Class3;
    void func3();
    // ...
}

<p>Is there a way to relate to <code>Lib3</code> in the same manner as <code>Lib2</code>? That is: refer to entities in <code>Lib3</code> inside <code>Lib1.hpp</code>, without including <code>Lib3.hpp</code> but still allowing client code to include both <code>Lib1.hpp</code> and <code>Lib3.hpp</code> with no hassles?</p>

<p>If, in <code>Lib1</code>, it is declared:</p>

<pre><code>// Lib1.hpp
namespace Lib3 {
    void func3();
}

namespace Lib1 {
    inline void inlineY() {
        Lib3::func3();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>then it might occur conflicts if client code includes both <code>Lib1.hpp</code> and <code>Lib3.hpp</code> -- certainly not in this simple example in which the declarations are identical, but subtle differences in real situations can trigger warnings or errors at syntax level, even if the underlying ABI is the same, since this violates the premise of not declaring anything outside the <code>Lib1</code> namespace.</p>

<p>Hope this helps to understand the question.</p>

My method uses OpenGL's stencil buffer to draw a grid of lines on each even row of pixels. On my laptop, the resulting image <strong>looks</strong> interlaced, but when I output to the 3DTV (via HDMI cable), it looks as though the lines are not drawn on each even row of pixels. The vertical resolution of my laptop and the TV is 1080 pixels. The screen coordinates used below range from (-1, -1) for bottom left of the screen to (1, 1) for top right. Here is the code I am using to draw the grid on the stencil buffer. I'd be grateful if someone could sanity check it for me, to see if I'm doing something fundamentally wrong.

<p>I edited my question with complete code and explanation and hope something can give me clearer explanation.</p>

<p>I have the following Class that has a backgroundworker to track the percentage progress of a loop and update the percentage progress on a Label on ProgressWin's XAML. The following code works perfectly. (My question is far below, after the code.)</p>

<pre><code>public partial class ProgressWin : Window
{
    BackgroundWorker backgroundWorker1 = new BackgroundWorker();

    public ProgressWin()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        InitializeBackgroundWorker();
        startAsync();
    }

    // Set up the BackgroundWorker object by 
    // attaching event handlers. 
    private void InitializeBackgroundWorker()
    {
        backgroundWorker1.WorkerReportsProgress = true;
        backgroundWorker1.WorkerSupportsCancellation = true;
        backgroundWorker1.DoWork += new DoWorkEventHandler(backgroundWorker1_DoWork);
        backgroundWorker1.RunWorkerCompleted += new RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler(backgroundWorker1_RunWorkerCompleted);
        backgroundWorker1.ProgressChanged += new ProgressChangedEventHandler(backgroundWorker1_ProgressChanged);
    }

    private void startAsync()
    {
        backgroundWorker1.RunWorkerAsync();
    }

    public void backgroundWorker1_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
    {
        BackgroundWorker worker = sender as BackgroundWorker;

        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++)
        {
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500);
            worker.ReportProgress(i * 10);
        }
    }

    // This event handler updates the progress.
    public void backgroundWorker1_ProgressChanged(object sender, ProgressChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        label1.Content = (e.ProgressPercentage.ToString() + ""%"");
    }

    // This event handler deals with the results of the background operation.
    public void backgroundWorker1_RunWorkerCompleted(object sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)
    {
         resultLabel.Content = ""Done!"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here comes my problem, now instead of tracking the loop within the ProgressWin, I need to track the loop in my MainWindow:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++)
        {
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500);
            ????.ReportProgress(i * 10);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I have no idea where to go from here. I tried instantiating an object from ProgressWin and call the DoWork but I end up frozen the ProgressWin window.</p>
