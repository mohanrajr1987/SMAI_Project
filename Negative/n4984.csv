"27657630","1","","","2014-12-26 13:11:54","","1","83","<p>in this program I calculate the angle for the right shoulder &amp; right elbow, as well as the angle for the left shoulder &amp; the left elbow.

<p>As you can see, I am calculating the angles with the ""Dot-Product"" and the acos. The (/PI*180)is to turn the number into the angle (0-360). I wonder what is wrong.</p>

<p>I have a file called memberlist and update.php loops through each line in memberlist.txt and inserts or updates the columns in the table. If you look at the above query (that is just me trouble shooting) I don't actually want to delete it's just to show you the \r\n at the end. It's bringing back 0 in all columns except for the name pandora25 (which happens to be at the bottom of memberlist.txt. What I don't understand is I have a php script to edit memberlist.txt on my website, and that's when the problem occurs. But say I open memberlist.txt via SFTP and upload it to my website, it works correctly. So maybe it's something to do with the editing of the txt file with php and it's adding and invisible \r\n at the end I'm not sure. But I have studied quite a bit on this issue and I've looked that you can insert into a MySQL table with ->prepare in PDO (I don't use mysqli).</p>

<p>I believe the loop variable [$k] plays an important role in this problem. Here is my code that I seem to be having a problem with:</p>

          // Connect and create the PDO object
          $conn = new PDO(""mysql:host=$hostdb; dbname=$namedb"", $userdb, $passdb);
          $conn-&gt;exec(""SET CHARACTER SET utf8"");      // Sets encoding UTF-8

<p>The purpose of this script is to use start.php to insert the current grabbed data into hitpoints_starting_exp, magic_starting_exp and range_starting_exp. I then run stop.php which is a similar script and insert the data grabbed there into hitpoints_end_exp, magic_end_exp and range_end_exp. I then echo a table on index.php which calculates the difference between the two columns.</p>

<p>Somehow, only after interacting with my UIAlertView, I'm unable to dismiss the keyboard in another view of my app. It's as though the Alert is breaking my UITextField's ability to resignFirstResponder.  Below I instantiate my UIAlertView, which then calls its didDismissWIthButtonIndex method. Then, I call the showInfo method, which loads another UIViewController.  </p>

<pre><code>UIAlertView *emailFailAlert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@""Error""
                            message:@""error message text.""
                           delegate:self
                  cancelButtonTitle:@""Not now""
                  otherButtonTitles:@""Settings"", nil];
[emailFailAlert setTag:2];
[emailFailAlert show];
[emailFailAlert release];
</code></pre>

<p>Once the 'Settings' option is pressed, I'm calling this method:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)alertView:(UIAlertView *)alertView didDismissWithButtonIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex {   
    if ([alertView tag] == 2) {    
        if (buttonIndex == 1){      
            [self showInfo:nil];
        }
    }   
}
</code></pre>

<p>My showInfo method loads the other ViewController, via the code below:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)showInfo:(id)sender {
    FlipsideViewController *fscontroller = [[FlipsideViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""FlipsideView"" bundle:nil];
    fscontroller.delegate = self;
    fscontroller.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal;
    [self presentModalViewController:fscontroller animated:YES];
    [fscontroller release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Upon clicking any textField in this Flipside VC, I'm unable to dismiss the keyboard as I normally can with <code>- (BOOL)textFieldShouldReturn:(UITextField *)textField</code>, and <code>[textField resignFirstResponder]</code>. I've omitted this code bc this question is getting long, but I'm happy to post if necessary.</p>

<p>The interesting part is that if I comment out the <code>[self showInfo:nil]</code> call made when the button is clicked and call it by clicking a test button (outside the alertView didDismissWithButtonIndex: method), everything works fine.  Any idea what's happening here?  </p>

<p>Yes, it's easy to create this but getting it to be responsive fluently without using too many @mediaqueries is a hassle to me!</p>

<p>There are 4 media queries atm. If you resize the browser from 1200 px down to ""mobile size"" you will see that the text tends to jump out of the box and if you ""hover"" over the ""a"" link with firebug in firefox, you can see that the selectable/clickable field moves a little every time and if it weren't for the queries, it would be much worse!!</p>

<p>I have theories of what should IN THEORY work although when things get transformed, they behave so abnormally turning around ""height"" and ""width"" but maybe I am missing something?</p>

<p>I also tried setting the width in ""a"" links to a percentage and other things as well so they would ""flow"" but not successfully!</p>

<p>If I'm missing to write any information, please let me know!</p>

<p>Does anyone have a solution for this to work responsively?</p>

<p>If I have missed a post regarding this issue, I'm sorry, I tried searching!</p>

<p>trouble is, i'm quite new to php, mysql and codeigniter, and while i've managed to display all the active orders in a table format, i can't seem to find much help on how to reference foreign keys using the active record helper in codeigniter.  i'm hoping someone can help me.</p>

<p>I wasn't able to reproduce the glitch in a code snippet, so I'll have to point you to the live site:</p>

<p>My <strong>full source code</strong> is here: <a href=""https://github.com/MightyPork/tzork"" rel=""nofollow"">MightyPork/tzork</a>, including the SCSS and Typescript that's compiled to CSS and JS. If you have time and can reproduce the bug, I'd be most grateful if you tried to find what's wrong. I've never seen anything quite like this before.</p>

<hr>

<p>When you put mouse over the labels, they get a background and a border on one side, which should be 2px wide. Sometimes though, Chrome shows just one pixel. When I change the width to 1px, sometimes it shows no border at all (only near the corners).</p>

<p>You can clearly see how inconsistent it gets. My browser zoom is at 100%, so that is not the cause.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what's up, but it apparently depends on the current time = angle = position of the labels, and WINDOW SIZE.  </p>

<p>I round the position to nearest pixel, so fractional position is not the cause.
I also tried rounding to odd / even pixel, that but didn't help either.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another issue is that in Firefox, sometimes hovering the labels causes numbers on the clock face to <strong>move / change letter spacing</strong>. I don't get it, there's no connection at all.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Here goes the story</strong>: 
I used to write code like the following:</p>

<pre><code>Type3 myFunc(Type1 input1, Type2 input2){}
</code></pre>

<p>But recently my project colleges told me that I should try, as mush as possible, to avoid writing function like this, and suggest the following way by putting the returned value in the input parameters.</p>

<pre><code>void myFunc(Type1 input1, Type2 input2, Type3 &amp;output){}
</code></pre>

<p>They convinced me that this is better and faster because of the extra copying step when returning in the first method. </p>

<hr>

<p>For me, I start to believe that the second method is better in some situations, especially I have multiple things to return or modify. For example: the second line of following will be better and faster than the first one as avoiding copying the whole <code>vecor&lt;int&gt;</code> when returning.</p>

<pre><code>vector&lt;int&gt; addTwoVectors(vector&lt;int&gt; a, vector&lt;int&gt; b){}
void addTwoVectors(vector&lt;int&gt; a, vector&lt;int&gt; b, vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;result){}:
</code></pre>

<p>But, in some other situations, I cannot buy it. For example, </p>

<pre><code>bool checkInArray(int value, vector&lt;int&gt; arr){}
</code></pre>

<p>will be definitely better than </p>

<pre><code>void checkInArray(int value, vector&lt;int&gt; arr, bool &amp;inOrNot){}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, I think the first method by directly return the result is better in terms of better readability.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>In summary, I am confused about (emphasis on C++):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What should be returned by functions and what should not (or try to avoid)?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there any standard way or good suggestions for me to follow?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can we do better in both in readability and in code efficiency?</strong></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: 
I am aware of that, under some conditions, we have to use one of them. For example, I have to use <code>return-type functions</code> if I need to achieve <code>method chaining</code>. <em>So please focus on the situations where both methods can be applied to achieve the goal.</em></p>

<p>I know this question may not have a single answer or sure-thing. Also it seems this decision need to be made in many coding languages, like <code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, etc. Thus any opinion or suggestion is much appreciated (better with examples).</p>

File A has about 100,000 lines with 19 words and integers separated by a space. I need to cut several lines from file A and paste them into a new file (file B). The lines should be deleted from file A. The lines to be cut from file A should have an exact matching string.
I then need to repeat this several times, removing lines from file A with a different matching string every time. Each time, file A is getting smaller.
I can do this using ""sed"" but using two commands, like this:</p>

<pre><code># Finding lines in file A with matching string and copying those lines to file B
sed -ne '/\&lt;matchingString\&gt;/ p' file A &gt; file B

#Again finding the lines in file A with matching string and deleting those lines,
#writing a tmp file to hold the lines that were not deleted.
sed '/\&lt;matchingString\&gt;/d'file A &gt; tmp

# Replacing file A with the tmp file.

<p>To login manually, users type in their username and password, it is passed through the hash and matched.</p>

<p>Upon successful login, two cookes are created for the user. One holding the unhashed username, the other holding the hashed token.</p>

<p>When the user visits, if the cookies are set, the site hashes the username and then uses these two values to login.</p>

<p>The advantage of this approach is that it avoids storing the user's password anywhere on their computer. Someone could crack the token and gain access to their account but at least I wouldn't have jeopardized the user's password...</p>

<p>So when I click on the 'Cancel' button, it asks me to select a record first because it is a grid control. But if I remove the parameters to select certain records, then the button will not do anything.</p>

<p>Do you know if there is already a built-in cancel or SaveAsCancelled or deactivate function that do not need require to select a record first?</p>

<p>I did do a ./configure as I need the qmake and moc tools.My changes are nowhere related to these tools. Now I am building one more Qt application, which requires Qt Core.

<p>""<strong>Project ERROR: Unknown module (s) in QT: core</strong>"".
I am not sure why am I getting this error. I tried to set the PATH variable to <strong>PATH</strong>=/Users/name/Qt/bin:$PATH and also set <strong>QTDIR</strong>=/Users/name/Qt and even<br>
 <strong>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</strong>=/Users/name/Qt/lib.</p>

<p>Am I missing out any variable to be set. How to make qt know that qt libraries are already available(copied one's) even if qt is not explicitly installed in system.</p>

<p>The code is as follows which is controlling the image size:</p>

<pre><code>'image' =&gt; $this-&gt;model_tool_image-&gt;resize($option_value['image'], 285, 85),
</code></pre>

<p>This makes all images 285 x 85.</p>

<p>My issue is that on a custom page I have 6x1 option, 3x another and so on. Therefore, I need the images to be of different sizes, preferably keeping their ratio after reload (though the images are bigger in reality - i.e. 855x255). </p>

<p>I've tried $auto, max_width=100% (in place of the 285/85)and so on, but to no effect.</p>

<p>I guess the control of the option size will come from the stylesheet, but for the life of me, after 4 hours of searching, I cannot find a way to be rid of this code and for it to work as I wish.</p>

<p>I cannot think of another way to modify the image size other than the stylesheet, and any relationship to ""auto"" (size) is redundant so far!</p>

<p>Before it's suggested, funds are at an absolute 0. Therefore, I am unable to purchase extensions/ mods and so forth. I apologise in advance</p>

<p>FURTHER ADDITION: This code:</p>

<pre><code>'image' =&gt; $this-&gt;model_tool_image-&gt;resize($option_value['image'], $width == $auto, $height == $auto),
</code></pre>

<p>Brings the image up to the original size, but gives an error:</p>

<p>""Notice: Undefined variable: width in C:\xampp\htdocs\OC\vqmod\vqcache\vq2-catalog_controller_product_product.php on line 373""</p>

<p>Which is the above line of code (with $auto).</p>

<p>So, can I add to my image controller, or something or other, to allow multiple resizing of many different sizes of image, to give a half sized image?</p>

<p>Here is what I'm trying to do (in image form)</p>

Basically, the front-end takes some user input and uses that to query the API and retrieve results. When the results are retrieved, they are displayed. This is all done asynchronously.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do I use something like Celery to handle the API querying in the background?</li>
<li>Assuming I use AJAX (which I will), do I have different URLs for handling user input and retrieval of the query results?</li>
<li>Do I use something like long polling to get and display the results with JavaScript?</li>
<li>Considering that the retrieved results can be further filtered, I'm considering using memcached as a storage. Is this appropriate?</li>
</ol> 

<p>If there's anything I've missed, or if there's a better approach, I'd be glad to hear about it.</p>

<p>Edit: I realized that I explained the requirements in a wrong way, so I'll try to reword.
Basically, my website is based on an API I have no control over. So, there's the 3rd-party API, my application with Django in the back-end and the front-end with JavaScript, CSS and HTML.</p>

<p>This is the reason why I introduced Celery into the mix. The flow of the application, in my mind, is like this. The user enters the required information on my web page and, when the user submits the data, that is sent to my back-end asynchronously. Now, Celery is used to send a request to the 3rd-party API and retrieve data. Meanwhile, my front-end keeps polling my back-end for the data and starts displaying it as it receives it.</p>

<p>I constantly see people writing ""filter you inputs"", ""sanitize your inputs"", don't trust user data, but I only agree with the last one, where I consider trusting any external data a bad idea even if it is internal relative to the system.</p>

<p><strong>Input filtering:</strong>
The most common that I see.
Take the form post data or any other external source of information and define some boundaries when saving it, for example making sure text is text, numbers are numbers, that sql is valid sql, that html is valid html and that it does not contain harmful markup, and then you save the ""safe"" data in the database. </p>

<p>But when fetching data you just use the raw data from the database.</p>

<p>In my personal opinion, the data is never really safe.
Although it sounds easy, just filter everything you get from forms and url's, in reality it is much harder than that, it might be safe for one language but not another.</p>

<p><strong>Output filtering:</strong>
When doing it this way I save the raw unaltered data, whatever it might be, with prepared statements into the database and then filter out the problematic code when accessing the data, this has it's own advantages:
<em>This adds a layer between html and the server side script.</em>
which I consider to be data access separation of sorts.</p>

<p>Now data is filtered depending on the context, for example I can have the data from the database presented in a html document as plain-escaped-text, or as html or as anything anywhere.</p>

<p>The drawbacks here are that you must not ever forget to add the filtering which is a little bit harder than with input filtering and it uses a bit more CPU when providing data.</p>

<p>This does not mean that you don't need to do validation checks, you still do, it's just that you don't save the filtered data, you validate it and provide the user with a error message if the data is somehow invalid.</p>

<p>So instead of going with ""filter your inputs"" maybe it should be ""validate your inputs, filter your outputs"".</p>

<p>so should I go with ""Input validation and filtering"" or ""Input validation and output filtering""?</p>

<p>So after fiddling around with the recursion functions a bit I realized something quite peculiar and I can't quite wrap my head around it. I understand the first part of the function where it prints from 3 to 0, but I don't understand the second part when it prints from 0 to 3 again. Wouldn't the function just stop when n = 0?  </p>

<p>I though it could be done easily since i use PLINQO I already have a LinqEntityBase class but unfortunately there's no partial methods like OnMyEntityLoaded(MyEntity instance) in the DataContext class...</p>

<p>The only method I see to do it is in the OnLoaded method of the entity but I would have to keep a ref to the current datacontext (or the connectionString) ""somewhere"" before and retrieve it after, it doesn't look ok at all (and if I work with multiple dbs in the same time it is just not possible).</p>

<pre><code>[""1,8"", ""4,6,8"", ""8,9"", ""6,9""]
</code></pre>

<p>1/ I would like to turn it in to this</p>

<pre><code>[1,8,4,6,8,8,9,6,9]
</code></pre>

<p>2/ I would then like to find matching values, by looking for the most number:</p>

<pre><code>[8]
</code></pre>

<p>This first has been solved with this:</p>

<pre><code>var carArray  = [""1,8"", ""4,6,8,7,7,7,7"", ""8,9"", ""6,9""];

//1) create single array
var arr = carArray.join().split(','); 

//2) find most occurring
var counts = {}; //object to hold count for each occurence    
var max = 0, maxOccurring;
arr.forEach(function(el){     
    var cnt = (counts[el] || 0); //previous count
    counts[el] = ++cnt;
    if(cnt &gt; max &amp;&amp; cnt &gt; 1){ //only register if more than once (cnt&gt;1)
        max=cnt;
        maxOccurring = el;
    }
});


if(maxOccurring){
    //there was an element more than once, maxOccuring contains that element
    setResult('Most occuring: ' + maxOccurring + ' (' + max + ' times)');
}
else{
    //3)/4) ???
    setResult('sorting?');
}

//below is only for test display purposes
function setResult(res){
    console.log(res);
}
</code></pre>

<p>3/ If the are no matching values like this</p>

<pre><code>[1,8,4,6,5,7]
</code></pre>

<p>4/ Then I need to compare this array to another array, such as this</p>

<pre><code>[6,7,4,1,2,8,9,5]
</code></pre>

<p>If the first number in &lt;4> array above appears in &lt;3> array, then get that number, ie in the above example I need to get 6. The &lt;4> array will be static values and not change. The numbers is &lt;3> will be dynamic. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Not the most elegant of answers, but I do have something working now. I didn't compare the original array directly with the second array, instead used simple if/else statements to do what I needed:</p>

<pre><code>var carArray  = [""1,5"", ""4"", ""8,2"", ""3,9,1,1,1""];
//1) create single array
var arr = carArray.join().split(','); 

//2) find most occurring
var counts = {}; //object to hold count for each occurence    
var max = 0, maxOccurring;
arr.forEach(function(el){     
    var cnt = (counts[el] || 0); //previous count
    counts[el] = ++cnt;
    if(cnt &gt; max &amp;&amp; cnt &gt; 1){ //only register if more than once (cnt&gt;1)
        max=cnt;
        maxOccurring = el;
    }
});
if(maxOccurring){
    //there was an element more than once, maxOccuring contains that element
    console.log('Most occuring: ' + maxOccurring + ' (' + max + ' times)');
    console.log(maxOccurring);
}
else {
    // If not occuring, match from a list
    if(jQuery.inArray(""6"", arr) !== -1) { console.log('6'); }
    else if(jQuery.inArray(""9"", arr) !== -1) { console.log('9'); }
    else if(jQuery.inArray(""7"", arr) !== -1) { console.log('7'); }

<pre><code>[project root]
  assets
    app
    js
      app.js
      vendor
        jquery-2.1.0.js
        jquery.jcarousel-core.js
        require.js
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using <a href=""https://github.com/requirejs/example-jquery-shim"" rel=""nofollow"">the shim config</a> so I first load RequireJS like so:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;script data-main=""assets/js/app"" src=""assets/js/vendor/require.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in app.js, I have this configuration of RequireJS: </p>

<pre><code>requirejs.config({
    ""baseUrl"": ""assets/js/vendor"",
    ""paths"": {
      ""app"": ""../../app""
    },
    ""shim"": {
        ""jquery.jcarousel-core.js"": [""jquery-2.1.0""]
    }
});

// Load the main app module to start the app
requirejs([""app/main""]);
</code></pre>

<p>When I load the page up with this framework, all the scripts seem to load, but I get an error in the jcarousel code in the browser console:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That error seems to come from the line in the jQuery wherein -- and I can't remember the technical name for this procedure -- the '$' symbols is mapped to 'jQuery', e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>        return Plugin;
    };
}(jQuery));  // THIS IS THE OFFENDING LINE
</code></pre>

<p>Any guidance here would be much appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION Based on Answer</strong></p>

<p>So the problem here was as @MakeeshSapkal put it, the line in my shim configuration for the jcarousel module should not have included .js.  So the configuration should have been: </p>

<pre><code>requirejs.config({
    ""baseUrl"": ""assets/js/vendor"",
    ""paths"": {
      ""app"": ""../../app""
    },
    ""shim"": {

"1744538","1","1745237","","2009-11-16 20:06:40","","5","615","<p>My understanding of a <em>factory</em> is that it encapsulates instantiation of concrete classes that all inherit a common abstract class or interface. This allows the client to be decoupled from the process of determining which concrete class to create, which in turn means you can add or remove concrete classes from your program without having to change the client's code. You might have to change the factory, but the factory is ""purpose built"" and really only has one reason to change--a concrete class has been added/removed.</p>

<p>I have built some classes that do in fact encapsulate object instantiation but for a different reason: the objects are hard to instantiate. For the moment, I'm calling these classes ""factories"", but I'm concerned that might be a misnomer and would confuse other programmers who might look at my code. My ""factory"" classes don't decide which concrete class to instantiate, they guarantee that a series of objects will be instantiated in the correct order and that the right classes will be passed into the right constructors when I call <code>new()</code>.</p>

<p>For example, for an MVVM project I'm working on, I wrote a class to ensure that my <code>SetupView</code> gets instantiated properly. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class SetupViewFactory
{
    public SetupView CreateView(DatabaseModel databaseModel, SettingsModel settingsModel, ViewUtilities viewUtilities)
    {
        var setupViewModel = new SetupViewModel(databaseModel, settingsModel, viewUtilities);
        var setupView = new SetupView();
        setupView.DataContext = setupViewModel;
        return setupView;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Is it confusing to call this a ""factory""?</strong> It doesn't decide among several possible concrete classes, and its return type is not an interface or abstract type, but it does encapsulate object instantiation.</p>

<p>If it's not a ""factory"", what is it?</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>A number of people have suggested that this is actually the Builder Pattern.</p>

<p>The definition of the Builder Pattern from <a href=""http://www.dofactory.com/patterns/PatternBuilder.aspx#%5Fself2"" rel=""nofollow"">dofactory</a> is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems like a little bit of a stretch also. The thing that bothers me is the ""different representations"". My purpose is not to abstract the process of building a View (not that that isn't a worthy goal). I'm simply trying to put the logic for creating a specific view in one place, so that if any of the ingredients or the process for creating that view change, I only have to change this one class. The builder pattern really seems to be saying, ""Let's create a general process for making Views, then you can follow that same basic process for any View you create."" Nice, but that's just not what I'm doing here.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p>I just found an interesting example in a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency%5Finjection"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia article on Dependency Injection</a>.</p>

<p>Under ""Manually Injected Dependency"", it contains the following class:</p>

<pre><code>public class CarFactory {

    public static Car buildCar() {
        return new Car(new SimpleEngine());
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>This is almost <em>exactly</em> the usage I have (and, no, I did not write the wiki article :)).</p>

<p>Interestingly, this is the comment following this code:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the code above, the factory takes responsibility for assembling the car, and injects the engine into the car. This frees the car from knowing about how to create an engine, though now the CarFactory has to know about the engine's construction. One could create an EngineFactory, but that merely creates dependencies among factories. So the problem remains, but has at least been shifted into <strong>factories</strong>, or <strong>builder</strong> objects. [my emphasis]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this tells me that at least I'm not the only one who's thought of creating a class to help with injecting stuff into another class, and I'm not the only one who attempted to name this class a factory.</p>

<p>This JSON format I'm getting from the WebAPI method GetGroup. How can I display the QR_Name array on the table list with the custom filter?</p>

<p>I'm trying to implement authentication on a Node.js server that has to get back the same hashed password that's stored in the database from PHP, this doesn't seem to work:</p>

<pre><code>/**

 * hashed password stored in the database. Uses the Node.js crypto library.
 *
 * @param password The password sent by the end user.
 * @param dbPassword The hashed password stored in the database.
 * @param dbSalt The encryption salt stored in the database.
 */
function validatePassword(password, dbPassword, dbSalt) {
    // Should the dbSalt be a Buffer, hex, base64, or what?
    var hmac = crypto.createHmac(""SHA256"", dbSalt);
    var hashed = hmac.update(password).digest('base64');
    console.log(""Hashed user password: "" + hashed);
    console.log(""Database password: "" + dbPassword.toString('base64'));
    return hashed === dbPassword;
}

<p>But apparently code-behinds are a no-no in MVC, and the logic is in controllers. I'm a little confused about how logic for a user control is ""wired up"".</p>

<p>I want to display an RSS Feed user control. So I have a page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Page Language=""C#"" MasterPageFile=""~/Views/Shared/Site.Master"" Inherits=""System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage"" %&gt;

&lt;asp:Content ID=""Content1"" ContentPlaceHolderID=""TitleContent"" runat=""server""&gt;
    Home Page
&lt;/asp:Content&gt;

&lt;asp:Content ID=""Content2"" ContentPlaceHolderID=""MainContent"" runat=""server""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;% Html.RenderPartial(""RssFeed""); %&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/asp:Content&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have my user control:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Control Language=""C#"" Inherits=""System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage&lt;SyndicationFeed&gt;"" %&gt;
&lt;%@ Import Namespace=""System.ServiceModel.Syndication"" %&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%: ViewData.Model.Title.Text %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;% foreach (var item in ViewData.Model.Items)
    {
       string url = item.Links[0].Uri.OriginalString;
    %&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='&lt;%= url %&gt;'&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;%= item.Title.Text %&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;% } %&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And I have this code that I need to run to get the rss data:</p>

<pre><code>using (XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""RssFeed""]))
{
    SyndicationFeed rssData = SyndicationFeed.Load(reader);

    return View(rssData);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But where does it go? In the controller for the page that contains the control?</p>

<p>Here are some details:
SP 2007 Enterprise
The page in question uses SmartPart to display custom usercontrol.<br>
We have 50+ pages that also use custom user controls in SmartPart, and none of them generate this error.</p>

<p>The page in question has several functions, and it initially loads just fine.  First time it loads, user selects a customer from a dropdown, then enters a search query and clicks the search button.  That all works, and the page then returns some search results.  That works as well.  The the user can click on a Modify link for each item.  It's clicking on this Modify link that generates the page error.  All of these things are done one this one page, it just refreshes accordingly.  The Modify link is just a standard asp:commandline field that causes the page to load the line item in editable mode.</p>

<p>Here's the other strange thing.  If I login as the SP Administrator account, and go to this page, it all works properly, no errors...and, then all other users can go in and use the page properly, without errors as well.  It's as if whatever the security issue is, is being resolved temporarily as a result of the Admin using the page first. But after a code publish, or IISRESET, etc, the page goes back to not working for any general users.</p>

<p>Any ideas on what I should look for in trying to resolve this issue?  I can also provide code if anyone thinks that may be relevant.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Now, my problem is that the function ""buildWithArgs"" doesn't respect the $args parameter, which is always empty when I run or debug the script, no matter what I pass in. The $solutionsToBuild parameter works flawlessly, however. Do I have improper syntax? Even if it were the case that my $cleanArgs string was somehow improperly formatted or not escaped, I can't even make the function work with simple strings like ""asdf"", as $args is always empty when I run it.

<p>So how long is too long? After doing some testing, I have discovered that if the length of the string is <code>1,971,324 or less</code> everything works. Otherwise, I get the above exception. I don't know if this is something with Spring, or tomcat, etc. Also, I have verified with Chrome that wkt parameter is getting sent in all cases, regardless of length. So the Spring error message when it is too long does not make much sense to me. Is <code>1,971,324</code> some magic number somewhere?</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

Also the source and the destination may not have the same size, so I need to use linear filtering (or even mipmap).</p>

<pre><code>void CopyToTex(GLuint dest_tex,GLuint src_tex,
               GLuint src_width,GLuint src_height,
               GLuint dest_width,GLuint dest_height,
               float srcRect[4],
               GLuint destRect[4]);
</code></pre>

<p>Here srcRect is in normalized 0-1 coordinates, that is the rectangle [0,1]x[0,1] touch the center of every border pixel of the input texture.</p>

<p>To achieve a good result when the input and source dimensions don't match, I want to use a <code>GL_LINEAR</code> filtering.</p>

<p>I want this function to behave in a coherent manner, i.e. calling it multiple times with many subrects shall produce the same result as one invocation with the union of the subrects; that is the linear sampler should sample the exact center of the input pixel.</p>

<p>Moreover, if the input rectangle fit exactly the destination rectangle an exact copy should occur.
This seems to be particularly hard.</p>

<p>What I've got now is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>//Setup RTT, filtering and program

float vertices[4] = { 
      float(destRect[0]) / dest_width * 2.0 - 1.0,
      float(destRect[1]) / dest_height * 2.0 - 1.0, 
      //etc..
};

float texcoords[4] = {
      (srcRect[0] * (src_width - 1) + 0.5) / src_width - 0.5 / dest_width,
      (srcRect[1] * (src_height - 1) + 0.5) / src_height - 0.5 / dest_height,
      (srcRect[2] * (src_width - 1) + 0.5) / src_width + 0.5 / dest_width,
      (srcRect[3] * (src_height - 1) + 0.5) / src_height + 0.5 / dest_height,
};

glBegin(GL_QUADS);
glTexCoord2f(texcoords[0], texcoords[1]);
glVertex2f(vertices[0], vertices[1]);

glTexCoord2f(texcoords[2], texcoords[1]);
glVertex2f(vertices[2], vertices[1]);

//etc...
glEnd();
</code></pre>

<p>To write this code I followed the information from <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLSL_Programming/Rasterization"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> page.</p>

<p>This seems to work as intended in some corner cases (exact copy, copying a row or a column of one pixel).</p>

<p>My hardest test case is to perform an exact copy of a 2xN rectangle when both the input and output textures are bigger than 2xN.</p>

<p>I probably have some problem with offsets and scaling (the trivial ones don't work).</p>

<p>Please see example below:</p>

<p>This is the text I'm searching.</p>

<pre><code>[Date]
;Possible values: Local, Static
;Type = Local
;If using Static type, the year/month/date to set the date to
;Year = 2012
;Month = 1
;Date = 1

[Time]
;Possible values: Local, Custom, Static
Type = Static
;If using Custom type, offset from UTC in hours (can be negative as well)
Offset = 0
;If using Static type (Hour value always the same on every server start), the value (0-24) to set the Hour to
Hour = 9
</code></pre>

<p>What I am trying to accomplish is a lookahead and obtain only the Type = Static under the [Time] bracket. I am using C# if that helps.  I have tried many many different patterns with no success.</p>

<pre><code>(?&lt;=\[Time\]\n+Type = ).* 
(?&lt;=\[Time\].*Type =).*
</code></pre>

<p>That's just a few ideas that I have tried.  Can someone please show me the correct way to do this with an explanation on why it is doing what its doing?  Based on the comments I noticed that I should be more clear on the fact that this file is much larger then what I have shown and almost each [SETTING] contains atleast one type flag to it.  Also its almost 100% sure that the user will have ;comments put into the file so I have to be able to search out that specific [SETTING] and type to make it work.</p>

"17980793","1","17981875","","2013-07-31 20:54:42","","2","2591","<p>Here is what I would like to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a local git repository that mirrors an upstream one</li>
<li>Be able to push ""local"" branches / changes to that repository and keep those locally</li>
<li>Keep this repository in sync with the upstream one, including:
<ul>
<li>Fetch any new branch</li>
<li>Delete any reference of branches that are deleted upstream</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I setup my cron job to fetch all the changes from upstream and prune any branch that have been deleted like this:</p>

<pre><code>*/5 * * * * cd /home/git/myrepo.git &amp;&amp; git fetch origin &amp;&amp; git remote prune origin &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>So far what I have tried (and why it failed):</p>

<p>1- Setup the git repository as a mirror (as described <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14860643/how-to-make-a-local-git-repository-that-mirrors-an-upstream-repository"">here</a>)</p>

<pre><code>git clone --bare --mirror URL
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with that is when it does the <code>git remote prune</code>, it is also deleting references to the ""local"" changes that have been pushed there (and not to the upstream server).</p>

<p>I also tried to have this local repository be the mirror for two separate repositories (with the same master but some different branches) and I hit a similar problem when doing <code>git remote prune</code>, it will delete the branches coming from the other repository.</p>

<p>2- Setup git only as a bare repository:</p>

<pre><code>git clone --bare URL
</code></pre>

<p>But then <code>git fetch origin</code> is not updating properly, it seems to be downloading the objects, but does not create the refs and then only prints</p>

<pre><code> * branch            HEAD       -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>and the ""location"" of the current branches is not being updated with what's in the upstream server.</p>

<p>I also tried <code>git remote update</code> as described <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/6151419/347565"">here</a>, with the same result.</p>

<p>I can <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/17333302/347565"">convert that repository as a mirror</a> with:</p>

<pre><code>git config remote.origin.fetch 'refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*'
</code></pre>

<p>But that only brings me back to the problem in (1)</p>

<p><b>So my question is what exactly is the difference then the <em>functional tests</em> are run through ""test-app -integration"" versus ""test-app""?</b></p>

<p>The only difference from what i thought was that ""test-app"" is running all test phases (unit, integration, functional).</p>

<p>And the weird thing is that it <em>do works</em> somehow, but only if i run ""test-app -integration"" first :/</p>

<p>Im using the following setup:</p>

<li>geb 0.7.0<br></li>
<li>spock 0.6<br></li>
<li>htmlunit-driver 2.0rc3 (ive tried with 2.20.0 but gave me even more problems)<br></li>

Each way corresponds to a mapping of attributes from one table to the other. The strength of a join for a mapping M from table T1 to T2 is the percentage of rows from T1 that join to some row of T2 under the mapping M. I am interested in finding all the mappings that have support greater than a threshold t. This is a very expensive operation since the number of possible mappings is exponential in the number of attributes. Thus, I am thinking to consider sampling techniques for join discovery.</p>

<p>For <strong>example</strong>, consider <a href=""http://www.tpc.org/tpch/"" rel=""nofollow"">TPC-H</a> benchmark database. Say we were given the tables for <strong>customer</strong> and <strong>orders</strong> relation. We have raw data. We dont know what each attribute corresponds to. Now by seeing the data, we should be able to derive that customer.customer_id and orders.customer_id are <strong>join columns with high support</strong> but not customer.customer_age and orders.customer_id. Similarly we should find all joins possible and order them according to their support. Since checking every possible combination of attributes is very costly we need an efficient technique to be used.</p>

<p>Real use-case: I am given a raw huge dataset where columns are isolated(assume 2 tables are there for simplicity). I want to discover what are the joins possible from it with support value efficiently. 
(Note: Since I dont know anything about type of attributes, I am thinking to consider all of them as strings and use sampling)</p>

<p><strong>I am clear that sampling is required. My questions are only the following.</strong></p>

<p>What is a good sampling strategy here? What metadata should be computed to decide the sample sizes? Can the sampling of each table be done independently or should they be correlated?</p>

<p>There's some place that I use require to get a JavaScript <code>viewModel</code> like:</p>

<pre><code>require([""myScripts/serviceRunner""], function (viewModel) {
    console.log(""ViewModel loaded:"" + viewModel)                            
                  });
</code></pre>

<p>At the server side, there's a controller and action which handles the http requests like:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:1441/api/UL/LoadJS
</code></pre>

<p>So instead of having <code>require([""http://localhost:1441/api/UL/LoadJS/serviceRunner""]</code>. I've defined a path like:</p>

<pre><code>require.config({
    paths: {
    ""myScripts"": ""http://localhost:1441/api/UL/LoadJS""
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works just fine. But after optimization and creating main-built using weyland, The require cannot load the given path.</p>

<p>Is there any configuration that I missed for optimization?</p>

<p>FYI, I'm using Durandal 2.0.1</p>

I am trying to configure the Apache instance to gzip certain (white-listed content types) responses to the client. Apache is using mod_jk to connect to Tomcat (though the same issue is present when using mod_proxy, so I don't think that my issue is related to mod_jk or Tomcat).</p>

<p>I have this very simple mod_deflate configuration:</p>

<p><code>AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html</code></p>

<p>This causes <code>text/html</code> responses to be gzipped as expected. However, when I try to download files generated by Tomcat, e.g. a spreadsheet with content type <code>application/vnd.ms-excel</code>, those files are also being gzipped:</p>

<p>Here are the response headers when downloading the file directly from Tomcat:</p>

<pre><code>Cache-Control:max-age=0

Pragma:public

Set-Cookie:fileDownloadToken=true; Path=/
</code></pre>

<p>And this is when downloading the file via Apache:</p>

<pre><code>Cache-Control:max-age=0
Connection:Keep-Alive
Content-Disposition:attachment; filename=""file-20130322-104524.xls"";

</code></pre>

<p><strong>I can't figure out why mod_deflate is gzipping this response (above)?</strong> </p>

<p>After commenting out the line <code>AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html</code>, the files are no longer gzipped, so I am certain it is that line which is triggering mod_deflate. The same problem is present for file downloads with content-type of <code>application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet</code> and possibly others as well. However, downloading a javascript file from Tomcat (via Apache), isn't gzipped (as expected because the content type doesn't match the rule):</p>

<p>The fact that mod_deflate gzips these spreadsheets is a problem because it causes the response to be buffered, triggering chunked encoding, which I don't want because I want the browser to show a progress monitor (these could be really large files).</p>

<p>My intent was for <code>*new</code> to point to the same location <code>name[]</code> points to, but obviously as the address changed, it points to a different place.</p>

<p>I feel that what's happened is that once the copying ended, C moved the original contents of the destination string minus the number of characters changed (4 for ""bye"") to a new address and assigned that to <code>*dest</code>. </p>

<p>Is this what's really happening? And could somebody please explain to me why?</p>

<p>This is not really work related, I'm just trying to understand better how pointers behave.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your replies!</p>

But from past experience and poor experiences with other sites not doing well when JavaScript is disabled, I thought I would pay more attention to it for this current project.</p>

<p>Regarding <code>input type=""text""</code> POST fields, this is not a problem.  But for the drop-down I happen to be using, I cannot get it to persist.  Well, I can, but then the default selection is not correct.  Here is some code...</p>

<p>Basic drop-down structure:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""topic"" name=""topic""&gt;
    &lt;option value=""Select an option""&gt;Select an option&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""Topic A""&gt;Topic A&lt;/option&gt;

    &lt;option value=""Topic C""&gt;Topic C&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I thought maybe if I blended <code>selected</code> with POST data, I could get it to work like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""topic"" name=""topic""&gt;
    &lt;option selected=""selected"" value=""Select an option""&gt;Select an option&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""""&gt;&lt;?php echo $_POST['topic']; ?&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""Topic A""&gt;Topic A&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""Topic B""&gt;Topic B&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""Topic C""&gt;Topic C&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn't persist; it only goes back to the default, 'Select an option'.</p>

<p>Trying this didn't work either:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""topic"" name=""topic""&gt;
    &lt;option value=""Select an option""&gt;Select an option&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option selected=""selected"" value=""""&gt;&lt;?php echo $_POST['topic']; ?&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""Topic A""&gt;Topic A&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""Topic B""&gt;Topic B&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""Topic C""&gt;Topic C&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It persists, but doesn't have the correct default.  Starts out blank (because POST is not entered yet).</p>

<p>I have done some Google searches and not really found anything very useful for this kind of thing, so I'm not sure where to go next.  Any ideas/suggestions?</p>

<p>Part of this is collecting files, zipping them up, then encoding the zip file as Base64 and writing it into the email as an attachment.  My problem is that whenever I send files over a certain size (I don't know exactly what size that is; somewhere between 20 KB and 2 MB) the zip file ends up corrupted on receipt.  (When opened in WinRAR it complains ""unexpected end of archive"", and the CRC values are all zero-valued, if that's any clue).</p>

<p>I suspect I might just be writing it into the email in such a way that I'm letting garbage or duplication in, but I can't see where it's happening.  Here's the snippet I'm using to do the reading/encoding/writing; it's using MIME::Base64, and obviously has an open Sendmail handle.</p>

<pre><code>  TelnetClient client = new TelnetClient();
  client.registerNotifHandler(new TelnetNotificationHandler() {
    @Override
    public void receivedNegotiation(int negotiation_code, int option_code) {
      ALog.i(this, ""negotiation code: %d, option code: %d"", negotiation_code, option_code);
    }
  });
  try {
    client.addOptionHandler(new TerminalTypeOptionHandler(""VT100"", false, false, true, false));
    client.addOptionHandler(new SuppressGAOptionHandler(true, false, true, false));
    client.addOptionHandler(new EchoOptionHandler(true, true, true, true));
  } catch (InvalidTelnetOptionException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
  }

  try {
    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(""/sdcard/spy.out"");
    client.registerSpyStream(fos);
  } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
  }

  InputStream in = null;
  PrintWriter out = null;

  String ip = getIpAddress(p);
  ALog.i(this, ""connecting to: %s"", ip);
  try {
    client.connect(ip);
    in = client.getInputStream();
    out = new PrintWriter(client.getOutputStream(), true);

    if (!expect(in, ""login: "", 5000)) {
      return;
    }
    if (!send(out, ""root"")) {
      return;
    }

<p>Here's the <code>expect()</code> and <code>send()</code> methods,</p>

      } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      }
    }
    t.interrupt();

  protected boolean send(PrintWriter out, String s) {
    out.println(s);
    out.flush();

The CSV files are largeish (~ 1-2 MB) and they're slow to generate. So as not to tie up my web dynos, I'm passing these download request off to worker dynos (using Resque), and assembling the CSV there.  My resque worker looks something like this.</p>

<pre><code>class Downloader

  def self.perform(ids_to_download)
      models = Model.where(:id =&gt; ids_to_download)
      csv_data_for_client = models.to_csv 
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>I'm wondering about the best way to send the csv file back to the client who requested it. </p>

<p>If this code were in a Rails controller, this could be accomplished with simply <code>send_data csv_data_for_client</code>. This approach doesn't seem to work from within the Resque worker, though.</p>

<p>From researching on SO and elsewhere on the internet, it seems that I have a few options.</p>

<ol>
<li>Send the data directly from the Resque worker ( Though I'm not sure if this is possible)</li>
<li>Save the data to the heroku filesystem, retrieve it in a controller, and then send it with <code>send_data</code></li>
<li>Save it to the database (postgresql), retrieve it in a controller, and then use <code>send_data</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Can anyone offer advice on the best way to proceed?  Thanks.</p>

<p>We are currently not using any CMS at all and we have some custom development that will not go away just because we go with a CMS for some or most of our site.</p>

<p>Our custom development is c# ASPX with Site Master and nested Site Master pages. These custom apps do not own their own top level in our web site, but are part of a branch, typically one or two levels down (for example, http:www.contoso.com/branch/app/default.aspx).</p>

<ul>
<li>How is DotNetNuke typically configured in a CMS/Custom “mixed mode”? For example, is DotNetNuke installed at the “top” of the web site, or “where needed” down in the web site. </li>
<li>How does this relate when mixing CMS and custom web applications? </li>
<li>Does the CMS interface allow for adding these custom apps or do you just go to the web server and add them to the structure?</li>
<li>It appears from reading other posts, we can create our own custom c# modules and have CMS editors “drop in” the modules on the pages. Can someone confirm that for me?</li>

Does it happen basically immediately, just on another thread which then blocks on <code>EndWrite</code> waiting for the actual writing to happen? Does it happen when some sort of lower-level buffer in the sockets API underflows? Does it happen when the data has been actually written to the network? Does it happen when it has been acknowledged?</p>

<p>The data is stored as a list of arrays. Each component in the list represent data grouped by a specific factor. The arrays have three dimensions. The first dimension represents time, the second dimension represents number of constituents, and the third dimension represents data points. So in the example data below each constituent (second dimension) has three data points (third dimension) per time unit (first dimension).</p>

<p>The first and third dimension have a fixed nrow (time) and ncol (data points), while the second dimension varies for each group (components in the list) which I why stored the arrays in a list.</p>

<p>So the data would be structured as below.</p>

<pre><code>data.list &lt;- vector(""list"", 3) 

numb &lt;- c(2,3,4)

data.list[[1]] &lt;- array(1:(numb[1] * 5 * 3), dim = c(5, numb[1], 3))
data.list[[2]] &lt;- array(1:(numb[2] * 5 * 3), dim = c(5, numb[2], 3))
data.list[[3]] &lt;- array(1:(numb[3] * 5 * 3), dim = c(5, numb[3], 3))
</code></pre>

<p>If I wanted to calculate the mean over time for the first data point across all constituents in group 1 (given it is not stored in a list) I would just do:</p>

<pre><code>apply(array[,, ""data.point.1""], 1, mean)
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to apply mean over rows (time) across all groups (components in the list) and across constituents (second dimension in the arrays) - but I cannot find a solution.</p>

<p>I have tried to use sapply because essentially I would like to get a vector as the output with the length corresponding to nrow of the arrays (essentially the number of time periods in this problem). However, sapply would apply a function on each component and return a vector with the length of the list (at least that is what happened for me).</p>

<p>Can anybody see a good solution to this problem?</p>

<p>If not, is the fundamental problem then, that the data might be stored the wrong way for the type of computation I want to make?</p>

Instead of the normal one account per user, I'm developing a system where you have one account (email and password), which is linked to various smaller accounts (which have different IDs, display names, access roles... basically another table in the database). These smaller, or 'sub' accounts, are completely independent of each other.  </p>

<p>I currently have it working to where I can log into the ""Master"" account, and I have a dropdown list in the user menu that will be used for switching between the various sub accounts. However, I'm stuck on just how I go about achieving switching account and keeping it persistent.</p>

<p>I have tried extending CWebUser and adding a <code>setSub($id)</code> method that takes the ID of the sub account to switch to, and setting the <code>$currentSub</code> variable to the sub account model, but that doesn't seem to be working... I have no idea where to start with this.</p>

<p>All I really need is the <code>displayName</code> and <code>id</code> of the sub account to persist, and a way of changing these values on any page of the site. I can then use the ID on personalized pages and go from there (as opposed to using the id of the ""master"" account, which is set as <code>Yii::app()-&gt;user-&gt;id</code>). I guess I just don't know how to set the variables and have them persist.</p>

<p>This error always occurs when I click/select from my selected pupil in the pupilListDataGrid into the ListBox with the schoolclasses.</p>

<p>This started to occur when I changed my Repository loading technique from Eager loading to Lazy loading.</p>

<p>My SelectedSchoolclass changes then I load the according pupils
My SelectedPupil changes then I load the according documents</p>

<p>Here the ItemSource is set to the all the pupils from the SELECTED schoolclass.
I do not need IsSynchronizedItem stuff because I do not really have aggregated data due to the new lazy loading entities just via id of the parent entity.</p>

<p>AdminViewMOdel:</p>

<pre><code>public PupilViewModel SelectedPupil
        {
            get { return _selectedPupil; }
            set
            {
                _selectedPupil = value;
                this.RaisePropertyChanged(""SelectedPupil"");
                GetDocumentsForPupil();
            }
        }

private void GetDocumentsForPupil()
        {
            var documentsOC = new ObservableCollection&lt;Document&gt;(_docRepo.GetDocumentsByPupilId(_selectedPupil.Id));
            SelectedPupil.Documents.DocumentList = documentsOC;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>I guess the problem is the following:</p>

<p>When I jump from a selected Document or Pupil and select a schoolclass without any pupils it binds to NULL because my ObservableCollection is lazily created means only when I get data from database else the PupilListViewModel_Collection is NULL.</p>

<p>Well I would like to stick with Lazy loading and do not need binding hierarchy like DataGrid_ItemsSource=SchoolclassList/PupilList what I used for Eager loading.</p>

<p>How could I get rid of that exception?</p>

<p>""CLOSE_WAIT"" essentially means that his is a state where socket is waiting for the application to execute close(). But since I'm calling Google API,and the httpClient calls are encapsulated in the API, I cannot control the close of any httpClient. Neither could I find a way to dispose or close TableDataInsertAllResponse. I digged more into BigQuery API call, and found the implementation is actually in Google .NET Client API, the call path finally goes to this method:</p>

<pre><code>       private async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; ExecuteUnparsedAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        using (var request = CreateRequest())
        {
            return await service.HttpClient.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Am I using the API correctly?</li>
<li>if the answer to 1 is yes:  I'm wondering, if, whenever any exception happens at the closing bracket of the using statement, the request wouldn't be properly disposed and thus the underlying TCP connection wouldn't be closed properly? </li>
<li>I initialized BigQueryService, which is disposable indeed, only once in the lifetime of my BigQueryHelper.cs in its constructor. This instance is used during the lifetime of my program. is this a potential break-point? Would I rather create bigqueryservice instance everytime when I need to send a request and dispose it after request's end? Since there's a authorization process involved, I'm worried that this can slow down the performance.</li>

Interface Builder was unable to determine the type of ""MainMenu.xib"".

<p>I also don't see the usual WYSIWYG editor when I select <code>MainMenu.xib</code> just a black screen. I notice the ""type"" of file is ""Default - Abstract Interface Builder File"", whereas on other working projects I have built in the past, the ""type"" is ""Default - Interface Builder File"". Seems there's something about it being an ""abstract"" file that's causing Xcode to not display the interface builder.</p>

<p>I tried fully uninstalling Xcode and re-downloading it from the App Store. Didn't help. Multiple google searches have turned up nothing helpful, and the other Stack Overflow questions with a similar title to mine aren't illuminating. I can't imagine everyone else with Xcode 5.1 has this issue. Any experts out there that could suggest a quick fix? </p>

I'm trying to extract values from my four sliders, but they have to be matched to their respective vars e.g. ambienceSliderValue when collected so I can compare them to their JSON counterparts (ambienceRating)</p>

<pre><code>var refreshRestaurant = 
    $("".restaurant &gt; div"").each(function(){
            // Some code to extract things like spicyness, expensiveness
            // this part should maybe be in the JSON object constructor above to push data? Perhaps I should use .val(); instead?
            var ambienceRating = $(this).data(""ambienceRating"");
            var spicyRating = $(this).data(""spicyRating"");
            var garlicRating = $(this).data(""garlicRating"");
            var expensiveRating = $(this).data(""expensiveRating"");

               // Also some code to get the slider values...

<p>getBlackMatrix() - 
Converts a 2D array of luminance data to 1 bit. As above, assume this method is expensive and do not call it repeatedly. This method is intended for decoding 2D barcodes and may or may not apply sharpening. Therefore, a row from this matrix may not be identical to one fetched using getBlackRow(), so don't mix and match between them.</p>

<p>getBlackRow()-
Converts one row of luminance data to 1 bit data. May actually do the conversion, or return cached data. Callers should assume this method is expensive and call it as seldom as possible. This method is intended for decoding 1D barcodes and may choose to apply sharpening.</p>

It all works fine in simple test cases where I encode some binary data and then decode the resulting string and write it to a new file. In this case the files are identical. </p>

<p>But then I wrote a web service that took the base64 encoded data as a parameter in a POST call. Although the length of the base64 data is identical to the string I passed into the function, the contents of the base64 data are being modified. I spend DAYS debugging this and finally wrote a test controller that passed the data in base64 to post and also took the name of a local file with the correct base64 encoded data, as in:</p>

<pre><code>data=AAA-base-64-data...&amp;testFilename=/name/of/file/with/base64data
</code></pre>

<p>Within the test function I compared every byte in the incoming data parameter with the appropriate byte in the test file. I found that somehow every ""+"" character in the input data parameter had been replaced with a "" "" (space, ordinal ascii 32). Huh? What could have done that? </p>

<p>To be sure I was correct, I added a line that said:</p>

<pre><code>data = data.replaceAll(' ', '+')
</code></pre>

<p>and sure enough the data decoded exactly right. I tried it with arbitrarily long binary files and it now works every time. But I can't figure out for the life of me what would be modifying the data parameter in the post to convert the ord(43) character to ord(32)? I know that the plus sign is one of the 2 somewhat platform dependent characters in the base64 spec, but given that I am doing the encoding and decoding on the same machine for now I am super puzzled what caused this. Sure I have a ""fix"" since I can make it work, but I am nervous about ""fixes"" that I don't understand.</p>

<p>The code is too big to post here, but I get the base64 encoding like so:</p>

<pre><code>def inputFile = new File(inputFilename)
def rawData =  inputFile.getBytes()
def encoded = rawData.encodeBase64().toString()
</code></pre>

<p>I then write that encoded string out to new a file so I can use it for testing later. If I load that file back in as so I get the same rawData:</p>

<pre><code>def encodedFile = new File(encodedFilename)
String encoded = encodedFile.getText()
byte[] rawData = encoded.decodeBase64()
</code></pre>

<p>So all that is good. Now assume I take the ""encoded"" variable and add it to a param to a POST function like so:</p>

<pre><code>String queryString = ""data=$encoded""
String url = ""http://localhost:8080/some_web_service""

def results = urlPost(url, queryString)

def urlPost(String urlString, String queryString) {
    def url = new URL(urlString)
    def connection = url.openConnection()
    connection.setRequestMethod(""POST"")
    connection.doOutput = true

    def writer = new OutputStreamWriter(connection.outputStream)
    writer.write(queryString)
    writer.flush()
    writer.close()
    connection.connect()

    return (connection.responseCode == 200) ? connection.content.text : ""error                         $connection.responseCode, $connection.responseMessage""
}
</code></pre>

<p>on the web service side, in the controller I get the parameter like so:</p>

<pre><code>String data = params?.data
println ""incoming data parameter has length of ${data.size()}"" //confirm right size

//unless I run the following line, the data does not decode to the same source
data = data.replaceAll(' ', '+')

//as long as I replace spaces with plus, this decodes correctly, why?
byte[] bytedata = data.decodeBase64()
</code></pre>

<p>Sorry for the long rant, but I'd really love to understand why I had to do the ""replace space with plus sign"" to get this to decode correctly. Is there some problem with the plus sign being used in a request parameter?</p>

"24017128","1","","","2014-06-03 13:57:39","","0","181","<p>Is there a standard way of handling errors when a 'findHasMany' call fails? Use case:</p>

<pre><code>Model: App.User
{
DS.hasMany('comments', {'async': true});
}
</code></pre>

<p>Template</p>

<pre><code>{{#each comment in comments}}
&lt;p&gt;{{comment.title}}&lt;/p&gt;
{{/each}}
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is that when the lazy loading of comments fails, due to some server issue for example, I want to be able to respond to that error in the UI (by routing somewhere else, showing a popup about errors on the page, etc). At the moment the promise just rejects. I thought that Ember Data might have some hook on the ManyArray for cases like this, but it doesn't seem to, and the store seems to define precisely nothing as the action to carry out in such cases: <a href=""https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/v1.0.0-beta.8/packages/ember-data/lib/system/store.js#L1758"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/v1.0.0-beta.8/packages/ember-data/lib/system/store.js#L1758</a>  - the promise is given a 'resolve' method, but not a reject method.</p>

<p>My options seem to be either subclassing the store, and adding in some reject code there, or subclassing DS.PromiseArray and observing the 'isRejected' property. Any thoughts would be very welcome!</p>

<p>EDIT:
This issue seems to boil down to the fact that, when handling models defined in a route, Ember and Ember Data work well together (you can catch rejecting promises in an error action) there is no similar structure for async requests directly through a template. One solution might be to have an observer in the controller that observes something like 'model.isError', but a failing hasMany relationship does not trigger an error on the owning model. I suppose instead I can do 'comments.isRejected', but again, I would have to code that in for every controller that has a model with a hasMany relationship, in other words, all of them, which doesn't seem very satisfactory. If models had an observable enumerable property (like ""hasManyIsError"": {comments: false, posts: true}) then it would be easy to observe any of them with 'hasManyIsError.length</p>

An 8-bit controller performs low level tasks and the PC is doing the image processing. I plan to implement it in a single room where the robot is placed and the robot and environment are tracked by a camera from a height or from the ceiling of the room. First, the robot needs to be mapped, like this <a href=""http://www.societyofrobots.com/programming_wavefront.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.societyofrobots.com/programming_wavefront.shtml</a></p>

<p>To do:</p>

<p>Track the robot from some height using camera Following the wavefont algorithim to locate robot and obstacles.</p>

<p>Procedure:(just my idea)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The camera will give image of the robot surrounded by obstacles in
the random places. using some opencv technique draw some grind over
the image.</p></li>
<li><p>Locating the grid which contain robot(by having some colored symbol
over the robot) and locating the grids containing the obstacle.</p></li>
<li><p>Now the grids with obstacle is thought as wall and the remaining is
the free space for the robot to navigate.</p></li>
<li><p>robot is going to get the goal place which should be reached is given
from the pc(may be like point the place to reach in the image by
mouse click).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>firstly finding the obstacle from the video stream is to be done for that iam going to catch a image of the robot which is in the room now the image is  edit by manually in M.S paint by filling the grid with stationary obstacle by some color say red.</p>

<p>now the edited image is going to be the reference and it is compared with video stream to tell the free space available to robot.</p>

<p>each grid is given some value using that place value of the robot should be determined </p>

<p>now i should be able to give some grid value in the free space to make it as goal for the robot </p>

<p>now the Pc should calculate and tell the robot which grid should be traveled to reach the goal. the only thing the robot need to figure out itself is dynamic obstacle avoidance like cat walking across the robot </p>

<p>comparing the area of the room with the image of some dimension to find how far the robot moved and how far to go</p>

<p>is it possible to do? can anybody help me to do this? </p>

I'm using the following parallell code (which works correctly). Its execution time almost halves when using twice more threads.

The front end has a single console-like interface that modifies one type of data at a time (such as academic degrees from one form, contact information from another). It is currently linked to multiple back ends (one for each type of data, and one for the basic profile information). All files are located on a network share and many of the back ends are encrypted.</p>

<p>The reason I have done that is that I understand that MS Access has to pull the entire database file to the local computer in order to make any queries or updates, then put any changed data back on the network share. My theory is that if a person is changing a telephone number or address (contact information), they would only have to pull/modify/replace the contact information database, rather than pull a single large database containing contact information, projects, degrees, awards, etc. just to change one telephone number, thus reducing the potential for locked databases and network traffic when multiple users are accessing data. </p>

<p>Is this a sane conclusion? Do I misunderstand a great deal? Am I missing something else? </p>

<p>I realize there is the consideration of overhead with each file, but I don't know how great the impact is. If I were to consolidate the back ends, there is also the potential benefit of being able to let Access handle referential integrity for cascading deletes, etc., rather than coding for that...</p>

<p>So, for instance I would like to create a new dataset with python. In order to do so one can use either the webinterface ( <a href=""https://developers.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/datasets/insert"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/datasets/insert</a> ) or a python based approach. So far, I figured somehow that I can do this here:</p>

<pre><code>#...do authentication an stuff...
bigquery_service = build('bigquery', 'v2', http=http)
datasets = bigquery_service.datasets()
datasets.insert(projectId=PROJECT_NUMBER, datasetId=""python-dataset"").execute() # this fails because I do not know which arguments are necessary nor accepted
</code></pre>

<p>So, I found out that the object ""datasets"" has a method ""insert()"" (btw: I figured this out by <code>print str(dir(datasets))</code>). My problem now: I do not find anywhere some kind of documentation where I can look up (1) the definition of the method <code>insert</code> nor (2) a description of all methods provided by the object <code>datasets</code>. A <code>print str(type(datasets))</code> just tells me that I got a <code>&lt;class 'apiclient.discovery.Resource'&gt;</code> object which does not help me much since on this page <a href=""http://google-api-python-client.googlecode.com/hg/docs/epy/apiclient.discovery.Resource-class.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-api-python-client.googlecode.com/hg/docs/epy/apiclient.discovery.Resource-class.html</a> I do not find any information that helps me.</p>

I have a picturebox array</p>

        player.Location = new Point(20, 240);

        {
            obstacles[i] = new PictureBox();
            obstacles[i].Size = new Size(10, 10);
            obstacles[i].Location = new Point(50, 340);
            obstacles[i].BackColor = Color.Red;
            Controls.Add(obstacles[i]);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I know it's not spawning them into a random location yet, but I won't do that 'till I get them to spawn at all.
Now when I try to create a method to use picturebox array, it's objects (picturebox[0-19]) are all just null?</p>

<pre><code>private void JustAnOtherTest(PictureBox obj)
{
    for (int y = obj.Top; y &lt; obj.Top + obj.Height - 1; y++)

<p>Now calling: JustAnOtherTest(obstacles[1]); and adding a watch for obj in JustAnOtherTest method will just give me a null, why is that?</p>

<p>EDIT: Seems like it never goes into the for loop, cause it exits Game_Load once it gets to player.Image = Properties.Resources.playerImg; which probably means that the problem is in the resource files... :S</p>

<p>EDIT2: Yeah, I was right, the problem was within resource files. I had messed up with some namespaces and it couldn't find the resource file cause it was in a different namespace, but I ain't so sure why it didn't give an error on that. How ever, after fixing all the namespaces, works just fine. :)</p>

<p>The celery worker's log level is DEBUG, the logfile shows that the task is registered with the proper name, and the django app's settings.py contains the correct IP and credentials for the rabbitmq server. In trying different approaches, I've occasionally seen an error message in the celery logfile when I changed the string passed to send_task to something that wasn't a valid task (ie send_task('asdf')). This caused an UnregisteredError in the logfile. However, this only happens sometimes, and so far in testing different combinations of settings and calls, I haven't found a way to reliably replicate the behavior.</p>

<i>The only solution I've found here is to write a JS loop that parses all the table html to a string and insert it with an id tag in the html. </i> </p>

<p>I'm fairly confident I'm just not using the AngularJS <code>ng-repeat</code> correctly and it should handle this all for me, but the documentation doesn't seem to be helping me much. Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>

"1903908","1","1904087","","2009-12-14 22:17:45","","0","1502","<p>I'm trying to use a pipelined function to save on time and reduce redundancy in my queries.
The function in question returns data from a reference table based on some input. Records in the main data table I am selecting from have multiple columns that all refer to the reference table. The problem I run into is that when I try to use the pipelined function more than once in the query, I get a ""cursor already open"" error.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>select xmlelement(""genInf"", xmlelement(""ID"", vt.ID),
                           xmlelement(""vID"", vt.V_ID),
                           xmlelement(""vNum"", vt.V_NUM),
                           xmlelement(""terrDataCode"", TERR_CODE.column_value), --data is based on reference table
                           xmlelement(""ABValCode"", AB_VAL_CD.column_value), --data is based on reference table
                           ...
from V_TAB vt, table(UTIL.fn_getOvrdValXML(vt.terr_cd_id)) TERR_CODE,
               table(UTIL.fn_getOvrdValXML(vt.ab_val_id)) AB_VAL_CD
where vt.ID = in_vID;
</code></pre>

<p>This worked fine until I added the second reference to my pipeline function (fn_getOvrdValXML), and I now get the ""cursor already open"" error.</p>

<p>The pipelined function is very simple:</p>

<pre><code>type t_XMLTab is table of XMLType; --this type is in the spec
....
function fn_getOvrdValXML(in_ID in ovrd.id%type) return t_XMLTab
        pipelined is
    begin
        for r in C_OvrdVal(in_ID) loop
            pipe row(r.XMLChunk);
        end loop;
        return;
    end;
</code></pre>

<p>The cursor is similarly simple:</p>

<pre><code>cursor C_OvrdVal(in_ID in ovrd.id%type) is
        select xmlforest(ID as ""valueID"", S_VAL as ""sValue"", U_VAL as ""uplValue"",
                          O_VAL as ""oValue"", O_IND as ""oIndicator"", F_VAL as ""finalValue"",
                          O_RSN as ""reason"") AS XMLChunk
        from ovrd_val xov;
        where xov.id = in_ID;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to work around this, or should I try to tackle this problem (the problem of having to reference ovrd_val and output an xmlforest in the same way many many many many times) differently?</p>

<p>I admit I'm new to pipelined functions so I'm not 100% sure this is an appropriate use, but it made sense at the time and I'm open to other ideas ;)</p>

I think I'm beginning to wrap my head around everything, but I'd like to make sure I've conceptualized things correctly. I've provided a a class and a list of what I <em>think</em> is going on:</p>

<pre><code>class Classy{
private:
    int foo1;
    int foo2;
public:
    //constructor 1
    Classy() { foo1 = 0; foo2 = 0; }
    //constructor 2
    Classy(int bar1) : foo1(bar1), foo2(0) {}
    //constructor 3
    Classy(int bar1, int bar2) : foo1(bar1) { foo2 = bar2; }
};
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Constructor 1 does things the way I'm used to; a call to the constructor sets the foo properties via assignment.</li>
<li>Constructor 2 uses inherited constructors from the int class.</li>
<li>Constructor 3 is a combination of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Inherited constructors can also be from a class' parent - for example:</p>

<pre><code>Child(args) : Parent(args) { ...extras }
</code></pre>

<p>which more or less acts like <code>Child(args) { super(args); ...extras }</code> in the languages I'm more familiar with. If we additionally have complex properties (say prop1 is a complex classes - a string or something), then we can instantiate them with their constructors through something like this: </p>

<pre><code>Child(args) : Parent(args), prop1(args) { ...extras }
</code></pre>

<p>Does that sum everything up properly? Are there any aspects that I'm missing, or useful elaborations on what I've stated?</p>

Brief Description:
I have a class let say <code>GetImageSource</code> and in that I have a method say <code>giveImgSource()</code>. Now my questions is:
In WCF I have to call this method and after getting <code>ImageSource</code> from this method I need to pass it to my silverlight Client.

<p>Running the above code, we get a window with a tabbed pane in it with three tabs.  If we make the window smaller, all of them get scroll bars, as intended.  If we make it larger, the three behave differently: the tab with labels only leaves them at the top left of the window, the tab with fields only centers them vertically on the left edge, and the one with the gridbag of mixed labels and fields centers them both horizontally and vertically in the enlarged window.</p>

<p>This is not acceptable for the application; I need to somehow make all the panels behave similarly in this way.  I need them all to have scroll bars, and I would like them all to keep to the upper left if the window is made larger than the internal panel.</p>

<p>One other requirement: my tabs are occupied by something that extends JPanel, I've been told before I can put JScrollPane directly into the tab, but for my application I don't want to do that either.  It just makes other things more complicated than they need to be.</p>

<p>In addition to wanting all the extra space to be put at the bottom and the right, I would dearly love to understand WHY these three situations behave differently.  I still believe that we would all be better off if we understood the principles behind what we're doing, instead of just copying examples right and left and doing things by trial and error until they work.</p>

<p>(Incidentally, I have a GroupLayout panel that does seem to gravitate to the upper left, but didn't think it was necessary for my question and this is 100 lines of code as it is.)</p>

<p>My current application and database design is fairly generic and nothing dealing with specific nodes in the hierarchy is hardcoded, with the exception of validation and lookup functions written to retrieve external data from each node's particular database.  This pleases me from a design point of view, but I'm nervous at the realization that the entire application rests on a handful of records in the database.  I'm also frustrated that I have to enforce certain aspects of data integrity with database triggers rather than by foreign key constraints (an example is where several different nodes in the hierarchy have their own proprietary IDs and I store them in a single column which, when coupled with the node ID can be used to locate the foreign data).</p>

<p>I'm starting to wonder whether it may have been appropriate to simply hardcoded these known nodes into the system so that it would be more ""type safe"" and less generic.</p>

<p>How does one know when something should be hardcoded, and when it should be a configuration item?  Is it just a cost-benefit analysis of clarity/safety now vs less work later, or am I missing some metric I should be using to determine whether or not this is appropriate.</p>

<p>The steps I'm taking to protect these valuable configurations are to add triggers that prevent updates/deletes.  The database user that this application uses will only have the ability to manipulate data through stored procedures.  What else can I do?</p>

When I run the program in NetBeans, it works fine, but when I build it and run the .jar file it only opens up the login window even when I input the correct username and password and click login.

<p>The way I used to do this was to take my HTML file, copy out the relevant section (the part that gets 'added more') and then save it into a variable in the Javascript. This became rather annoying when I had to make changes to the form as I would then have to make the same changes to the Javascript variable.</p>

<p>My new method is to create the variable dynamically in Javascript. When the page loads, I use jQuery to grab out the 'add more' part of the code and cache the HTML into a variable. Then when the 'add more' button is clicked, I append that cached HTML to the page.</p>

<p>The problem is with form inputs. The server-side code autofills the form with the user's data from the database. I want to cache that HTML data with no form inputs...</p>

<p>My current function looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>function getHTML($obj, clean)
{
    if (clean)
    {
        var $html = $obj.clone();

    $html.unwrap();

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I checked the database table, and while scrolling I was presented with: <code>Warning: a form on this page has more than 1000 fields. On submission, some of the fields might be ignored, due to PHP's max_input_vars configuration.</code> I'm not sure if this is related to the problem, however.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong> I came across something interesting... I repeatedly ran the script for the same category, 35. Every single time it would return the exact same data set of 134 items. The category itself contains 164 items. I browsed the items under this category on the this page <a href=""http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/catalogue?cat=35"" rel=""nofollow"">http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/catalogue?cat=35</a>, and it seems as though the script is omitting 30 of these items (it's the same 30 items every time). I used <code>sleep()</code>, and I even changed the script to not iterate over <code>$alpha</code>s that have 0 items, and I keep getting the same 134 items...</p>

<p>For category 35, I checked the page linked above and compared the items listed there and the items that my script output. On <a href=""http://pastebin.com/9Aj9AtWL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/9Aj9AtWL</a>, I posted a file of all 164 items; the ones marked with two asterisks before them were missing from my output. The pattern seems to be that after 12 items of the same <code>$alpha</code> (letter that they begin with), the rest of the items of that <code>$alpha</code> are omitted. I even tried other numbers for the category, and the pattern was the same: only the first 12 items per $alpha were output in my file...</p>

<pre><code>powershell -command ""&amp; { $x = New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application; $x.minimizeall() }""

<p>the problem is: this method minimizes everything including current cmd-console which should be in my case always visible to the user.</p>

<p>now, to workaround this problem I use  external <a href=""http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">nircmd.exe</a> tool and this part of my .bat-file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>:: change current command prompt window title
title my-cmd-console

:: minimize all open windows on the desktop with powershell command
powershell -command ""&amp; { $x = New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application; $x.minimizeall()  }""

:: bring console back to the front with nircmd.exe command 'win activate [filter window by title]' 
nircmd.exe win activate title ""my-cmd-console"" 
</code></pre>

<p>what I don't like about this code is that there is much 'flashing' on the screen: at start, the console appears on the desktop, then it gets minimized with all other windows and then it's brought back on the desktop front again.  </p>

<p>so, the question is: how to make console appear on the desktop front and 'lock it', so that it never gets out of sight until the command line EXIT is reached.</p>

<p>P.S.
not sure, but maybe there is an alternative solution to 'minimize all except for particular window' problem without need to use external <a href=""http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">nircmd.exe</a> tool. any ideas?</p>

While Cake's persistent JVM loads up blazing fast - it presents a bigger problem - my functions are also persistent!</p>

<p>To demonstrate the problem, I've started a cake project(using <code>cake new mess-up-with-cake</code>), and wrote this in <code>core.clj</code>:</p>

<pre><code>(ns mess-up-with-cake.core)

(defn main-function[]
  (println ""I'm in the main function"")
)

(println ""I'm in core.clj, not inside in any function"") 
</code></pre>

<p>And this is <code>project.clj</code>:</p>

<pre><code>(defproject mess-up-with-cake ""0.0.1-SNAPSHOT""
  :description ""TODO: add summary of your project""
  :dependencies [[clojure ""1.2.0""]])

(use 'mess-up-with-cake.core)
(deftask my-task
         (println ""I'm in my task"")
         (main-function)
)
</code></pre>

<p>When running it with <code>cake my-task</code>, I get:</p>

<pre><code>I'm in core.clj, not inside in any function
I'm in my task
I'm in the main function
</code></pre>

<p>No surprise here.</p>

<p>Now, I've changed <code>core.clj</code> to this:</p>

<pre><code>(ns mess-up-with-cake.core)

(defn main-function[]
  (println ""I'm in the main function"")
  (println ""I've made a change in the main function"")
)

(println ""I'm in core.clj, not inside in any function"")
(println ""I've made a change outside the main function"") 
</code></pre>

<p>And when I run it, I get</p>

<pre><code>I'm in core.clj, not inside in any function
I've made a change outside the main function
I'm in my task
I'm in the main function 
</code></pre>

<p><code>core.clj</code> was clearly reloaded, but the change I've made inside the main function was not printed! Only when I stop the JVM with <code>cake kill</code> and rerun it I get the desired result - but if I have to restart the JVM every time I change a function, I might as well go back to lein...</p>

<p>Any idea how to force cake to reload my functions(and <strong>only</strong> my functions - reloading the entire Clojure runtime + any libraries I'm using probably won't be much faster than restarting the JVM..)?</p>

Just using jquery and jquery-ui (I'd probably stop using jquery-ui if I knew how to create sliders without it).</p>

<p>I want to show the slider value (ui.value) inside the slider handle (ui.handle) and also in a div above the handle, like in the third example (Both options together):</p>

<pre><code>var initialValue = 5;

$(""#slider"").slider({
    min: 1,
    max: 50,
    value: initialValue,
    start: function( event, ui ) {
        $(ui.handle).find('.ui-slider-tooltip').show();
    },
    stop: function( event, ui ) {
        $(ui.handle).find('.ui-slider-tooltip').hide();
    },
    slide: function( event, ui) {
        $(ui.handle).find('.ui-slider-tooltip').text(ui.value);
        $(ui.handle).text(ui.value);
    },
    create: function( event, ui ) {
        var tooltip = $('&lt;div class=""ui-slider-tooltip"" /&gt;').css({
            position: 'absolute',
            top: -25,
            left: 0,
            border: '1px grey'
        });

        $(event.target).find('.ui-slider-handle').append(tooltip);
        $('.ui-slider-handle').text(initialValue);
    }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>But for some unknown reason, manipulating the slider handle is preventing to append anything to it or show/hide it.</p>

<p>I'm also having trouble to set the border of the tooltip, when inspecting the code it adds none automatically, and I don't know why... (jquery-ui ofc but why?)</p>

<p>I just want something like jquery mobile.</p>

<p>The problem is that performance of <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Rhino"" rel=""nofollow"">rhino</a> seems to be dramatically slower than a V8 or other native Javascript engines used inside modern browsers. While inside the browsers, the page needs 3 - 4 seconds to generate the EJS template at worst, <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Rhino"" rel=""nofollow"">rhino</a> needs 10 - 12 <strong>minutes</strong>. Both the page and the generator are using the same JSON gathered from a RESTful API.</p>

<p>I created a Javascript context using the highest optimization level:</p>

<pre><code>context = ContextFactory.getGlobal().
context.setOptimizationLevel(9);
scope = context.initStandardObjects();
scriptable = context.newObject(scope);
</code></pre>

<p>To invoke the EJS rendering process using the current <a href=""http://embeddedjs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">EJS library</a> </p>

<pre><code>function invokeEjs(ejsContent, parameters){
    try{
        var unwrap = eval('new Object(' + parameters + ')');
        return new EJS({
            text: ejsContent
        }).render(unwrap);
    } catch(e){
        return outputException(e, ejsContent);
    } 
}  
</code></pre>

<pre><code>HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; parameters = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();

// ... loading some content into parameters hashmap
// ...
String ejsTemplate = ""... a pre loaded ejs template from file ...""
String serializedParameters = jsonParser.toJson(parameters);
Function fct = (Function) scope.get(""invokeEjs"", scope);
Object resultTemp = fct.call(context, scriptable, scriptable, new Object[] { ejsTemplate, serializedParameters });
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>serializedParameters</strong> can get really big, but this doesn't bother the browser and I expect the Rhino implementation not to take more than twice the time.</p>

<p>I am currently stuck here and do not know how to proceed. How to profile what takes that much time? What can be the cause?</p>

<p>Why do this 3 AJAX requests work when Twitter clearly says you have to send an Authorization header?
<a href=""https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/authorizing-request"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/authorizing-request</a></p>

<p>If both GET, POST, HTTP header Authorization are accepted, why should I prefer HTTP header, is it more secure or maybe it doesn't matter since it's an API call?</p>

<p>As seen, I have a class that gets a list of string, works, and then call some local method which does some work and return a result object. I expect that the number of items in mySafeCollection would always be the same as works and also none of the items in mySafeCollection would ever be null as I return a new instance of the result object for each call but it is not the case!!! Sometimes mySafeCollection is missing an item or one its elements is null meaning that GetResult has returned null. This does not make sense! result is created for every call to the GetResult method. I initially thought it would be because of the mySafeCollection collection where it used to be a list the issue is due to conrreuncy issues on the List.Add method but even switching to ConcurrentBag did not solve the issue. Any clue? </p>

<p>Question:
Is there a way to create a postgres table's <code>timestamp with time zone</code> so that it considers the timezone to be UTC instead of server's local timezone ?</p>

<p>Note: <code>set timezone TO 'GMT';</code> is not a solution for me because it is works in only a specific session. Also, it would be great if the solution doesnot depend on Server's local timezone at all</p>

<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>We want to build a ""<em>traditional</em>"" <strong>server-side</strong>-<strong><em>only</em></strong>
rendered application using <strong>Hapi</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm trying to <em>understand</em> how to avoid returning a ""<em>raw</em>"" <code>400</code>
error to the client when <code>Joi</code> validation <em>fails</em>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10234331/a863744a-688b-11e5-9eb8-5e41d0f570e2.png"" alt=""register-iphone4s-sim""></p>

<p>We want to intercept this ""<em>email not allowed to be empty</em>"" <strong>validation error</strong> and display it in the html template back to the client,
instead of simply returning the <code>400</code> error.</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/hapijs/joi/issues/725#issuecomment-144482794"" rel=""nofollow"">@AdriVanHoudt</a> advised that we should:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Look at failAction under <a href=""http://hapijs.com/api#route-options"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hapijs.com/api#route-options</a> ""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we added <code>failAction: 'log'</code> to the <code>/register</code> route handler:</p>

<pre><code>{
  method: '*',
  path: '/register',
  config: {
    validate: {
      payload : register_fields,
      failAction: 'log'
    }
  },
  handler: register_handler
}
</code></pre>

<p>See code in:
<a href=""https://github.com/nelsonic/hapi-validation-question/blob/master/server.js"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>server.js</strong></a></p>

<p>the <code>register_handler</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>function register_handler(request, reply, source, error) {
  console.log(request.payload);
  console.log(' - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -');
  console.log(source)
  console.log(' - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -');
  console.log(error)
  return reply('welcome!');
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am expecting to see an error in the terminal/console
but when I try to <code>console.log</code> the <code>handler</code> :</p>

<pre><code>projectStarted = ""10-11-11""
developerNumber = 3
teamLeader = ""John""
</code></pre>

<p>As you see, all of this entries have different types.</p>

<p>For now I see two options:</p>

<p>1) Create GlobalData entity. Each field of it will be represented as unique column in the table and will contain unique setting.  This way I have no problems with type casting, but I would like to avoid it in case where there will be big amount of settings.</p>

<p>2) Create Setting entity. Each of it will contain two fields: key(Primary key) and value and will be represented as unique record in the table. This is preferable solution, but It's seems to me that I will get a lot of type casting, because settings can be any type.</p>

<p>So basically, I'm looking for the way to implement second solution without getting a lot of troubles from different types. Can anybody help me?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1.</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, thanks Christian. Just got similar idea.</p>

<p>What if I will have Settings entity, which will be like:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Table(name = ""settings"")
public class Setting {

    @Column
    private String key;
    @Column
    private String value;
    @Column
    private String converterClassFullName; //example by.lugovsky.MyConverter

    //Getters, setters
}
</code></pre>

<p>And GlobalData class.</p>

<pre><code>public class GlobalData {
    private Date projectStarted;

    private int developerNumber;

    private String teamLeader;

    Set&lt;Setting&gt; settings;

    //Getters and setters for all, except settings.

}
</code></pre>

<p>So basically my idea is to convert Setting entity before persisting/updating/ etc. I can do this in my DAO, but I was wondering, if I could annotate GlobalData class with @Entity annotation as well without creating new table. This way I can set OneToMany annotation to Setting's set and Perform conversions in the internal @PrePersist etc. methods.</p>

<p>Will Hibernate allow me to do this?</p>

<p>Thanks again</p>

The first recycler item is a header with a large top margin to create an empty space above it. Now I want clicks to work through that open space, swiping should also scroll the recycler. The views are in a simple frame.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;FrameLayout

        android:orientation=""vertical""
        android:scrollbars=""vertical""/&gt;

&lt;/FrameLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The recycler consumes all clicks with just top padding or margin. I need clicks to pass through, but swipes should stay in the recycler for scrolling.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I have the clicks working, the solution was:</p>

<pre><code>recycler.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener() {
        @Override
        public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
            background.dispatchTouchEvent(event);
            return false;
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have a problem, since I translate the background (parallax) the clicks aren't arriving on the correct positions. Do I have to translate the events too?</p>

I was working through a how-to on Mozilla's website regarding html5 video (<a href=""https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/08/building-interactive-html5-videos/"" rel=""nofollow"">link)</a>. I copied the source of <a href=""http://demo.jwplayer.com/text-tracks/search.html"" rel=""nofollow"">their demo</a> into notepad and saved to my local. When double-click the html file and view it via file://, the .vtt file referenced by the html5 tag  fails to load (fiddler shows no get is made for that resource). When I host the file through IIS and access it via http://, I can see the get in fiddler. </p>

<p>Searches online indicate that the html5  element require hosting through a webserver, but I'm curious as to <em>why</em>? I'm especially confused given that an html5 video can reference an *.mp4 using file://</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Thanks for your time...</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>The service works when I try to run it via a winforms client so I know the service is working. Question is how do I get it ready for testing as well, using WcfTestClient.</p>

<p>for example :</p>

To measure which parts of the code were slowed down is unfortunately not possible any more (not without downgrading the OS) since I did not save any profiling information for gprof when compiling under the old OS. Because the program does lots of matrix inversions, my guess is that one library (LAPACK?) or programming interface (openMP?) has been updated between Ubuntu 12 and 14 in a way that slows down everything. I believe this is a general problem which could be already known to somebody here. Which is the solution to get back to a fast Fortran code, besides downgrading back to Ubuntu 12 or 13?</p>

<p>PS: All libraries were installed from the repositories with apg-get and thus,they should have be also upgraded when I upgraded the system with ""apt-get dist-upgrade"", I could, however, check if they are indeed the latest versions and/or build them from scratch.</p>

<p>PS2: Thanks a lot for the suggestions. I followed Steabert's advice and profiled the present code: I recompiled with ""gfortran -pg"" and checked the performance with gprof. The program was suspiciously slow when calling some old F77 subroutines, which I translated to f90 without performance improvement. I played with the suggested flags and compared the time of one program iteration: Flags fno-aggressive-loop-optimizations, llapack and lblas did not yield any significant performance improvement. Flags latlas, llapack_latlas and lf77blas do not let to compile (/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lf77blas, etc), even though the libraries exist and are in the right path. Both the compiler flags playing and performance analysis suggest that my first guess (the slowing down being related to matrix inversions, lapack, etc) was wrong. It rather seems that the slowing down is in a part of the code where no heavy linear algebra is performed. Using “objdump my_exec -s” I have found out that my program was originally compiled with gfortran 4.6.3 before the OS upgrade. Instead of using the present gfortran (4.8.2). I could try now to compile the code with the old compiler.</p>

But mongodb couldn't recover it with <code>db.repairDatabase()</code> and <code>mongod --repair</code>. My temporary measure was backed up data using <code>mongodump</code>, then removed broken document using <code>.remove()</code> command.</p>

<p>Now the problem is how to restore complete database from backup and how to repair it properly. Is there any way to restore database with (or without) the broken document? </p>

I have about 70% of the program finished, but I have come to an impasse. I am pretty sure that my method and constructor class is correct (if not then please correct me on it), but I am stuck on the implementation class. I am not sure how I am to use the main method to initiate two people. Here are the instructions given to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>description - a string that identifies the characteristic</li>
<li>rating - an integer between 1 and 10 that indicates a person's desire for this characteristic in another person</li>
<li>Write a constructor that sets the description of the characteristic to a given string and sets the rating to zero to indicate that it has not yet been determined</li>
<li>Write a private method isValid(aRating) that returns true if the given rating is valid, that is, is between 1 and 10</li>
<li>Write a method setRating(aRating) that sets the rating to aRating if it is valid
Write a method setRating() that reads a rating from the keyboard, insisting that the rating supplied by the user be valid</li>
<li>getDescription - returns the description of this characteristic</li>
<li>getRating - returns the rating of this characteristic</li>
<li>getCompatability(Characteristic otherRating) - returns the compatibility measure of two matching characteristics, or zero if the descriptions do not match</li>
<li>getCompatibilityMeasure(Characteristic otherRating) - a private method that returns a compatibility measure as a double value using the formula: 
[m = 1 - (r1 - r2)*(r1 - r2)/81] when both ratings are nonzero; m is zero if either rating is zero. (Recall from Exercise 5 below that the constructor sets the rating to zero, indicating that it has not yet been determined.)</li>
<li>isMatch(Characteristic otherRating) - a private boolean method that returns true if the descriptions match </li>
<li>Implement a class named Dating Service that instantiates two people, Chris and Pat, and tests their compatibility by using all of the methods you have defined.</li>

<p>I used the lavalamp plugin and it works, but the webpage loses its responsiveness. On different devices, the header is not displayed in one line.</p>

<p>I tried to insert it in bootstrap. I inserted the lines of code of lavalamp CSS in bootstrap CSS file, shown here:</p>

<pre><code>.lavaLampWithImage {
    margin-top:10px;
    position: relative;
    height: 55px;

.lavaLampWithImage li a {

<p>I want to display the title of a 'System' UITabBarItem (More, Favorites, Featured, etc...) in a navigation bar. But where do I get the string from? The strings file of the MainWindow.nib doesn't contain the string (I didn't expect it to) and reading the title of the TabBarItem returns nil, which is what stumped me.</p>

<p>I've been told, there's no way to achieve it and I'll just have to add my own localised string for the terms in question. But I simply don't (want to) believe that!! That's maybe easy enough in some languages, but looking up, say, ""More"" in already presents me with more than one possible word in some languages. I'm not happy about simply sending these words for translation either, because it still depends on the translator knowing exactly which term Apple uses. So am I missing something simple here? What do other people do?</p>

<p>Obviously, setting the system language on my test device and simply looking to see what titles the Tab Items have is another 'obvious' possibility. But I really have a problem with half baked workarounds like that. That'll work for most languages, but I'm really gonna have fun when it comes to Russian or Japanese.</p>

<p>I'm convinced there must be a more reliable way to do this. Surely there must be a .strings file somewhere in the SDK that has these strings defined?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance...

Then for some testing, I separated one node out of the 50 node cluster. I shut down Cassandra, deleted data dirs, flushed nodetool. Then I edited the single node cluster and called it as ""Single Node Test Cluster"" I edited seeds, cluster_name and listen_address fields appropriately. I also setup JMX correctly. Now here is what happens.
1. When I run nodetool status on the single node, I see only one node as up and running. If I run nodetool describecluster, I see the new cluster name - ""Single Node Test Cluster""
2. When I run nodetool commands on one of the 49 nodes, I see total 50 nodes with the single node as down and I see cluster name as ""Test Cluster""
3. There are datastax-agents installed on each node and I had also setup OpsCenter to monitor the cluster. In OpsCenter, I still see 50 nodes as up and cluster name as ""Test Cluster""
So my question is why I am seeing these 3 different depictions of same topology and is this expected?</p>

<p>Another issue is, when I start Cassandra on the single node, I still see that it somehow tries to communicate with other nodes and I keep getting cluster name mismatch (Test Cluster != Single Node Test Cluster) WARN on the console before the single node cluster starts.</p>

<p>Is this as expected or is this is bug in Cassandra?</p>

Code is in Java but should work just as well in C/C++. As you can see from the implementation I am doing it most significant bit first, the 31st bit for integers. This would seem to be faster because once a subgroup is complete, it no longer needs to be iterated.</p>

<p>For example, as an analogy, imagine sorting words and you only have one word that begins with ""A"". Once you see the A and place the word at the beginning of the list, you no longer have to examine any further characters in the word. On the other hand, if you begin from the <em>end</em> of the word, you would have to look at every letter before you figured out it belonged at the beginning of the list.</p>

<p>So, based on this idea, I would think MSB order would be fastest, but am I missing anything? Is LSB just as fast for some reason? I know that LSB performs ""stable sort"", but I don't see any practical benefit to this.</p>

<p>BTW In Java, this runs 5 times faster than the built in Arrays.sort (when I do an in-place sort, not a keyed sort), which is pretty cool.</p>

<p>The same thing happens to me too. When I change the name of the topic it works for a while again. Then that service bus topic is corrupt again. Only 65-71% of messages arriving. Doesn't help to delete the subscritption, nor the topic. The topic name seems to be polluted somehow after a while. It is really really bad, because I have no way of telling when the topic is corrupt, except that the system doesn't work like it should when messages don't arrive. Creating a new topic with new name randomly now and then seems like an utterly bad solution.</p>

<p>I'm testing it through a loop in one process, sending the messages, then a loop in another process, receiving and counting. With a new topic name it works perfectly. And I know I only have one listener to the subscription, and it's a peek lock, requires the message to be completed.</p>

<p>Anyone? How can I solve this?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
There's a gotcha to be found here. I've had 1 subscription created and maintained a connection to it; 1 topic created, and the bus recreated 10 times, sending 100 msg every time. No msg lost.
I have had 1 subscription created, and a new subscriptionclient created for every time the bus is recreated and 100 msg sent. Losing 50% of msgs. 
Seems like the topic is aware of the previous subscriptionclient and the msgs are dealt to the two?</p>

<p><strong>NEW QUESTIONS:</strong>
I'm trying to wrap my head around how to handle this. Can anyone confirm that a restart of the process, leading to creating a new subscription client with the same subscription name, would make the topic deal out the messages between the first and the second subscription client, even though the first is no longer there?
Since I'm trying to handle faults by restarting my subscription module, i.e. going through the steps of checking if topic exists, if subscription exists, and then create subscription client, I'm struggling to understand how I could avoid the above described, and avoid messages being dealt out to the non existant subscriber also..</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion for solution, atm:</strong>
Keep track of old subscriptions, and if I have to restart process, create a new subscription?
Leaves a window between process going down and new subscription created, where messages will be pumped out to the ""dead"" subscription only. These messages will be lost.
But at least any messages after that will be received by the new subscription.
Man.. this problem must have been dealt with before. I'm not doing it right. Would highly appreciate some guidance here.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong>
It's all about the right tool for the job. This situation calls for a Queue, not a Pub/Sub.
Everything solved. I'm doing the same tests as above, but with queue instead, and of course, since it's decided clientside who receives a message, there is no problem with previous (dead) subscriptionclients taking messages from new ones. Only one queue client will be alive at a time, so there is only that one who can take msgs off the queue.</p>

<p><strong>The Core Problem</strong>
The root of all my problems comes from the fact my page will never fully load when I call it normally with webdriver, and thus will never preform the 2nd step, it's just always loading. It loads fine when you just go to the site with a normal browser. I've tried out a few work arounds that work intermittently, including opening the driver to google, and then going to the page which sometimes makes it load, and with </p>

<pre><code>IJavaScriptExecutor js = (IJavaScriptExecutor)Driver;
js.ExecuteScript(""return window.stop"");
</code></pre>

<p>as suggested by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22404581/do-not-wait-for-page-to-load"">this question</a>, which sometimes makes it continue without loading. But neither of those work consistently at all (probably &lt;50% of the time) </p>

<p>The best I've got so far is using the unstable load strategy. However that has its own different problems, all of which only happen sometimes.</p>

<p>1) Sometimes it doesn't wait for the page to load at all, and I get an ""Unable to locate element:"" exception within milliseconds of loading the page, despite the fact that I have a wait set up:</p>

<pre><code>new WebDriverWait(cdriver, 30).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOf(cdriver.findElement(By.id(myId))));
</code></pre>

<p>Thread.sleep(3000); solves that problem, but I've read that is a sloppy way to do things. </p>

<p>2) If I get passed that step, my test should click one link, then click another and continue on with the test. However, it often gets stuck after that first click. So if my code is like this:</p>

<pre><code>    Thread.sleep(3000);
   element1.click();
     System.out.println(""clicked!"");
    element2.click();
</code></pre>

<p>The first click (which doesn't load a new page, by the way, just a pop up on the same page) will work, but then the system will never print out ""clicked!"", it's stuck in the same way would be loading the page initially (without the unstable load thing). If/when it makes it over that hurdle, I think the rest of the test is fine. </p>

<p>Any ideas 1) why it works sometimes but not others. 2) how to fix it 3) how to just get my page to load in the first place</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

                                        // Instance&lt;subClassX&gt; is derived from 
                                        // BaseInstance.
</code></pre>

<p><em>&amp;... stands for getting an address, C++ Standard terminology might define object as being the address already, in this case &amp;... is the object itself</em></p>

<p>The class of subClassXObject is unknown at this point, it can be any defined subclass of BaseClass.</p>

<p>It is known that it is one of the direct derived subclasses of BaseClass which each also inherit from Instance&lt;subClassX&gt; where subClassX is the name of the direct derived subclass of BaseClass.</p>

<p>Instance&lt;subClassX&gt; inherits from BaseInstance. BaseInstance defines a public pure virtual function which Instance&lt;subClassX&gt; implements, it's name is getDescriptor.</p>

<p>Thus every subClassObject has access to getDescriptor.</p>

<pre><code>SubClassX* pointer = &amp;subClassXObject;
pointer-&gt;getDescriptor();               // This should work
</code></pre>

<p>(Or does it not? Now I am riddling: do I have to explicitly implement a base class public method in a subclass in order for someone being able to call it upon the subclass from outside? No..., haven't I?).</p>

<p>I like</p>

<pre><code>BaseClass* pointer = &amp;subClassXObject;
pointer-&gt;getDescriptor();
</code></pre>

<p>to work.</p>

<p><em>Moving getDescriptor from BaseInstance and Instance&lt;subClassX&gt; to BaseClass and each sub class is possible, however I want users of my BaseClass to only write application logic code, not infrastructure code (even if they only would have to return an Instance&lt;subClassX&gt; methods return value). The idea behind this is to create an object browser into which every sub classes instantiated object is fed and listed without users having to add any non-classpurpose-code.</em></p>

<p>Casting pointer to BaseInstance* crashes the application. Thus my question as phrased in the <strong>title</strong>.</p>

<p>the itemsServiceLogic is just a class that transforms the DTO into another Java class declared as an entity in order to be serialized in a database through JPA.</p>

<p>What happens is that I'm testing the application through the google chrome browser client Postman but when I send a JSON objet into the POST method, the received DTO has no properties so the database doesn't save anything, as all the DTO's properties are null.</p>

<p>I'm using Glassfish 4.0 to host my application and everything with the database works fine. What could be wrong?</p>

<p>The DTO class would be:</p>

   //item's description

Here is two quadratic equation's example.</p>

<pre><code>eqn1 = ""*=\frac{-*\pm\sqrt{*^2-4ac}}{2a}""
eqn2 = ""x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}""

<p>I need to compare these as correct, because, instead of x, b, I have use * for that. All I am doing is converting equations to word list.</p>

<pre><code>eqn1_word = [*,frac,*,pm,sqrt,*,2,4ac,2a]
eqn2_word = [x,frac,b,pm, sqrt, b, 2, 4ac, 2a]
</code></pre>

<p>so the vector is </p>

<pre><code>eqn1_vec= Counter({'*': 3, 'frac': 1, 'sqrt': 1, '2': 1, '2a': 1, '4ac': 1, 'pm': 1})
eqn2_vec = Counter({'b': 2, 'frac': 1, 'sqrt': 1, '2': 1, '2a': 1, '4ac': 1, 'x': 1, 'pm': 1})
</code></pre>

<p>Now my extension is I am checking the percentage of * in eqn1_word, then check with normal cosine similarity as given by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15173225/how-to-calculate-cosine-similarity-given-2-sentence-strings-python"">that</a> answer. At last, I am adding two values, which has to nearly equal to 1.</p>

<p>This works fine for most of scenario(if one variable is replaced by *). Here is * value is 3 for eqn1_vec, and in eqn2_vec b = 2, x=1. </p>

<p>The problem is numerator is getting small as intersection value is small. I have copied from my class. please ignore self.</p>

It needs to be at runtime because the decorators applied on the object depends on the arguments that the user gave when calling the program (arguments supplied with argv), so a same object could be decorated 3 times, 2 times, or not be decorated at all.</p>

<p>Here is some context, the program is a puzzle solver, the main behavior is to find a solution for the puzzle automatically, by automatically I mean without user intervention.  And here is where the decoration gets to play, one of the things I want to is draw a graph of what happened during the execution, but I want to do so only when the flag <code>--draw-graph</code> is used.</p>

<p>Here is what I've tried:</p>

<pre><code>class GraphDecorator(object):
    def __init__(self, wrappee):
        self.wrappee = wrappee
    def method(self):
        # do my stuff here
        self.wrappee.method()
        # do more of stuff here
    def __getattr__(self,attr):
        return getattr(self.wrappee,attr)
</code></pre>

<p>And why it did NOT work:
It did not work because of the way I built the application, when a method that did not exist in my Decorator class was called it felt back to the implementation of the decorated class, the problem is that the application always started invoking the method <code>run</code> that did not need to be decorated, so the  undecorated fall back was used and from inside the undecorated form it always called <strong>undecorated</strong> methods, what I needed was to replace the method from the object, not to proxy it:</p>

<pre><code># method responsible to replace the undecorated form by the decorated one
def graphDecorator(obj):
    old_method = obj.method

    def method(self):
        # do my stuff here
        old_method()
        # do more of my stuff

    setattr(obj,'method',method) # replace with the decorated form
</code></pre>

<p>And here is my problem, the decorated form does not receive <code>self</code> when it is called resulting on a TypeError because of the wrong number of arguments.</p>

The macro function itself is not important, except for the fact that it sends an HTTP request and creates an HTML file object, which I fear will cause Excel to crash if I paste, say, a column of 100 or more URLs and it starts trying to calculate all the values at once.  I can see that it stops and churns for a moment if I drag the formula down 10 cells where there is already a column of URLs.

The main controller sets itself as a delegate in the subcontroller. When the subcontroller is done doing its stuff, it notifies the delegate. Every now and then, this notification fails with EXC_BAD_ACCESS.</p>

2)I've tried setting a breakpoint just before the problematic command, but again I can't reproduce the issue.</p>

<p>I have no clue what's going on.</p>

<p>This is the delegate property declaration (the parent controller outlives the child):</p>

<pre><code>@property (assign) id&lt;ParentControllerDelegate&gt; delegate

<p>This is the problematic code:</p>

     [self.delegate done: self];
   } else {

<p>This is the the code on the delegate side (the delegate has been retained by the App_Delegate, as it is the main controller).</p>

<pre><code>- (void) done: (UIViewController *) caller {
   NSLog(@""Taken back control"");// this never displays
   [caller.view removeFromSuperview];
   [caller release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some extra info:
The main controller retains the subcontroller.
I've also modified the deallocs in both the main and sub controllers to log when it is called. Based on the visible logs, neither is ever called during the course of the application. Hence both the receiver and the sender of the message are valid objects.</p>

<p>I'm really at loss here. Looking forward to your help.</p>

<p>I think i have narrowed problem to:</p>

<pre><code>private Bitmap bitmap;

private static final String PHOTO_DIR = ""photodir"";

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
{
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    ImageView im = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.imv_Photo);
    im.setImageBitmap(bitmap);
    [...]
</code></pre>

<p>This works as expected. But this:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onClick(View v)
{
    try
    {
        ImageView im = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.imv_Photo);
        String st = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString() + ""/"" + PHOTO_DIR  + ""/test1.jpg"";
        Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(st);
        im.setImageBitmap(bitmap);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        // null
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>hangs the application (despite of try/catch block!) even with im.setImageBitmap(bitmap) removed. When i comment out BitmapFactory.decodeFile problem dissappears. Even worse xperia unmounts sd-card when plugged to usb and i don't know how to write pics to phone memory yet, so i'm unable to check log (btw: is there a way to get log later?)</p>

<p>When i remove code from onCreate(), onClick() works exactly once. I tried to set bitmap = null, and setImageBitmap(null) before decoding, but it doesn't help.</p>

<p>This seems very strange to me as samsung has no problem with same code.</p>

<p>Is there any solution or maybe i'm doing something wrong?</p>

<pre><code>f = 0.5 * (norm(C*x - d))^2;
</code></pre>

<p>and it is called in a main script by:</p>

<pre><code>[x, fval] = fmincon(@myfun, x0, -A, b, Aeq, beq, lb, ub);
</code></pre>

<p>C is a 170x72 matrix, d is a 170x1 vector, so x is a 72x1 vector. This part works well.</p>

<p>Now I want to multiply each element of C by a constant raised to a power, and solve for that power. So instead of C(1,1) = 4, now it should be = (2^p)*4. However, I want p to be solved for in the optimization as well, so p = x(73). I realize that augmenting the x matrix means I have to update x0, A, b, Aeq, beq, lb, ub to all include 73 elements, which I've done. The problem arises when I define the elements of the C matrix like C(1,1)= (2^x(73))*4, I get the: 
""Index exceeds matrix dimensions"" 
error every time I run the code.</p>

<p>The new x(73) element has no constraints or bounds associated with it (the lower and upper bounds are -inf and inf). Any thoughts on why this is not working or how to fix it? Is it somehow invalid to use an element of x inside C, then multiply by x as I do in the cost function?</p>

<p>Note: I realize this cost function looks just like least squares. I used fmincon originally since I had multiple objectives, and will continue to use it after I solve this problem because I need to add in nonlinear constraints.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I'm taking small steps through the error: first, I augmented the x0, A, Aeq, lb, ub, and C matrices/vectors to include the 73rd column, but don't actually use x(73) anywhere in C, and the corresponding elements in the above matrices/vectors that multiply x(73) are 0.  This actually works fine now, but when I print the x vector, it's only 72 elements long!  Not sure why this would be when all the other inputs are 73 now.  My thought is once I figure that out, I can try to use x(73) in the C matrix again.</p>

<p>This is what I ended up doing. Please comment if there was any other way.</p>

<p>In the php.ini file, I bumped the memory_limit to 256M
Then on the index.php page, I checked the incoming REQUEST_URI for the '/batch-process' and if NOT THERE, did an ini_set of memory_limit back down to 32M</p>

<p>Doesnt seem ideal, but could not get this to function otherwise on the large batch-process requests.</p>

Basically, it would be more for caching purposes if anything, since I retrieve all of my content from a web server database.  Regardless, I was wondering if Core Data would be useful is any of these situations:</p>

<p>Scenario #1: I retrieve a list of ""items"" from the web server and feed them into a table view.  This is essentially the first page the user sees.  The table can be refreshed to retrieve more results, but existing items likely won't change.  Over time this list of items could grow tremendously. Items can be deleted.</p>

<p>Scenario #2: A user has a friends list.  This list of friends will stay the same unless he or she adds more friends.  I imagine there will be a scenario where a friend deletes their account, in which case the friends list will be altered as well.</p>

<p>Scenario #3: Messages can be attached to items.  They can't be edited or deleted, so the only change in state for a list of messages would be if a new message was added. Essentially the same as items, except they can't be deleted.</p>

I've created a fancybox gallery with inline HTML. It works great on the first click-through, but when it loops back around to the first div, it starts displaying them out of order. Because of this, I'd like to simply disable looping. However, I've tried disabling it through the Javascript to no avail.</p>

<p>For the record, this is the pattern the gallery takes on when navigating through:</p>

<ul>
<li>Div 1</li>
<li>Div 2</li>
<li>Div 3</li>
<li>Div 4</li>
<li>Loops to Div 1</li>
<li>Div 3</li>
<li>Div 2 </li>
<li>Div 4</li>
<li>Div 3</li>
<li>Div 1</li>
</ul>

<p>^ If anyone can tell me why this is happening, go for it! It would be greatly appreciated. But I'll be content if I can just get it to stop looping</p>

<p>I'll share some of my code...</p>

So I come to you StackOverflow. Basically I'm trying to setup my karma test suite to give me code coverage in an lcov format so I can ship that off to CodeClimate. I had it so my test suite (used to) work, but now I can't seem to get anything from it except errors. My project is a Rails project and the files are setup to be preprocessed by the asset pipe (ie. name.js.coffee files) but if I include them in the coverage preprocessor it seems to preprocess them just fine, BUT it throws an error on every file. For example, something will be processed to a function and it'll say function is a reserved word, etc. So it still thinks they are coffeescript files I'm guessing and using that syntax appropriately. When I just try to process them using the coffeescript preprocessor though I get coffeescript errors where there shouldn't be any. Help?</p>

(It goes without saying that the number of permutations and combinations is very large) To make it more robust, I would like to do some checking on the parameters. Here is a shrunken version of my subroutine (the actual version has dozens of parameters with very specific, sometimes lengthy names):</p>

<pre><code># Obtain any parameters that differ from the defaults and send for processing

   }

   return &amp;$privateProcessingFunction('Data Path Configuration', \%params);

</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I currently do a check to see if the number of values is the same, as if something is sent in as ""chan1Enable"" instead of ""channel1Enable"", it will throw that number off.</p>

<p>But with so many calls to the subroutine from multiple other scripts written by multiple other engineers, I would like to find a way to find WHICH value was incorrect (e.g. Don't just say that there was an unexpected parameter, say that ""chan1Enable"" was invalid). Furthermore, if multiple values were incorrect, I'd like to list all of them.</p>

<p>What is the most efficient way to do this?</p>

<p>(I ask about efficiency since the function is currently called in over 400 different ways and that will likely continue to grow as the application expands.)</p>

<ol>
<li>Shipping info</li>
<li>Payment info</li>
<li>Order confirmation</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm trying to figure out a way that when the customer enters their shipping information, that data can be echo'd out onto my order confirmation part, so they can confirm that is where they want it shipped to.</p>

<p>The way I designed my checkout system is that all three parts are on the same page. Only one part shows at once and the others are hidden until the customer would click 'Proceed to xxxx'. When they click that Proceed button, nothing is being sent. It is just taking the div and showing it and hiding the previous div. Nothing is sent until when the customer clicks Submit order on the confirmation div.</p>

<p>I validate the fields and assigned them to variables so I can post the shipping and product info into my db.</p>

<pre><code>if($validation-&gt;passed()) {
    if(isset($_POST['create'])){

<p>If there is a new message, the title of the GV tab is ""Google Voice - Inbox (1) - Google Chrome"" and if there are no new messages, the ""(1)"" is missing, so that's why the search string for IfWinExist includes one a ""("".</p>

<p>This only works, however, when the GV tab has the attention within chrome (it will work when chrome is minimized or another window is active, as long as GV is the selected tab within chrome). But if another tab within chrome has the attention, then it won't work, and I can't figure out how to make it work. I've tried Adjusting SetTitleMatchMode, but that's all I could come up with to mess with. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>Our web site is hosted on server A(Windows server 2003 with IIS6), we also have a WCF web service that is used by the web site to get data from database, and this service is hosted on Server B(Windows server 2003 with IIS6). </p>

<p>So how to setup SSL/Certificate to make sure that the client server communication is encrypted? do I need to apply 2 certificate for each server?</p>

<p>I also have a very fundamental question, say my server's ip address is 192.168.0.5, it has multiple ports for different application, for example 8090, so which one is called domain? 192.168.0.5? or 192.168.0.5.8090?</p>

<p>This way I can get only types that don't depend on B and work with them.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I loaded A in the reflection as well as in the normal context. I used the reflection context A for calling GetTypes(). After getting types from the reflection context assembly, I had another problem. When I called Type.GetCustomAttributes(), I received the following exception</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is illegal to reflect on the custom attributes of a Type loaded via
  ReflectionOnlyGetType (see Assembly.ReflectionOnly) -- use
  CustomAttributeData instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I solved it by getting the same type from the normal context assembly.</p>

<pre><code>//... code omited for brevity
Type reflectionType = reflectionAssembly.GetTypes()[0];
//... code omited for brevity
Type goodType = normalAssembly.GetType(reflectionType.FullName);

<p>This way I prevented loading of B and used types from A independent from B.</p>

<p>It's all working fine except this.</p>

<p>I have a galaxy S2 and my brother a galaxy S3.</p>

<p>when u run the game in my phone, the enemy steps (Y axis) exactly where I want it to be.
but on my brother's phone, the enemy is a little bit more below where i want it to be.</p>

<p>This image explains better:</p>

<p><strong>My phone on left and my brother's phone on right.</strong></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/lTYSo.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The way i'm defining the enemy Y is like this:</p>

<pre><code>   public void addSprite(float screenWidth, float screenHeight) {
        tempSprite = new NormalZombie();
        tempSprite.x = 0;
        tempSprite.y = screenHeight - 30; //IMO this is the problem
        tempSprite.startpos = screenHeight - 30;
        tempSprite.maxX = screenWidth;
        sprites.add(tempSprite);
        background = new GameBG();

    }

<p>i'm pretty sure that i can't use '30' hard coded there because the difference between resolutions, but what do i need to use there to put the enemy in the same place on every phone?</p>

I am looking for a method of assigning a static IP address to the device (or configuring it to use DHCP, which will likely be the default).  There is no physical user interface, no screens or buttons to enter such information on the device itself.  It will have a web-based interface, but to use that it will need to obtain an IP address first and the user will need to know what that address is.</p>

<p>I have used a number of devices similar to this that come with utility that you run on a PC which detects the device on the network and allows you to view and change its IP configuration.  This is what I would like to do, but I'm not sure which protocols to use or how to go about it.  I picture the utility broadcasting a ""who's there?"" packet over the network and my black box device responding with an ""I'm here"" packet.  The utility would then theoretically know the device's MAC address and could communicate further by requesting its current IP configuration and sending it new configuration if needed.</p>

<p>Side note: The black box will be running some flavor of Linux and the utility should run on Windows.</p>

<p>EDIT: Typically we will ship one of these black boxes to a customer, they will unpack it and plug it into their network.  Outside of communicating with it over the network there is no way to configure the black box; there is no monitor and keyboard, no user interface panel of any kind, no means of editing any configuration files in the Linux file system.  The utility we provide the customer must be easy to use.  They should be able to run the utility, see the device in a list of detected black boxes, and select the device to view or modify its configuration.  These users are not system admins, I do not expect them to be able to connect to the black box via SSH and edit configuration files.</p>

<p>I welcome suggestions on approaches to take or protocols to use to accomplish my goal.  If you have experience doing what I am trying to do please outline what you did (or how you would do it now).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>This is example from ASP.NET Chart Control examples gallery, but this one is without any code behind ...</p>

<p>The only way how to at least get closer to this I've found is to create two series of data, each in its own chart area, but it's creating duplicated legend entries and with collectind small pie slices it changes color data entries.

When the view changes and you return they no longer work, there is no page refresh involved, but we use a simple view loading system using ng-include for the page changes (Sub pages not main routes).</p>

<p>I have some markup that is something like this.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""row"" ng-controller=""mainCtrl""&gt;
    &lt;ul class=""sidebar span3"" sub-nav&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a ng-click=""changePage('users')""&gt;Users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a ng-click=""changePage('posts')""&gt;Posts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div class=""span9"" view-partial ng-include=""route[active]""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>the ""sub-nav"" directive has a method to update the ""active"" scope variable. I then have a directive that listens for changes to the ""active"" variable and emits a ""pageChange"" event if the value is different. (They are separate from the controller as they are applied to more than just one). There is only one controller running this code at a time and it seems to work perfectly.</p>

<p>Inside the ng-include we are using ng-repeat to loop over the data, in the table this loop produces we have a delete button with a directive applied to it just like this one</p>

<pre><code>angular.module(""myModule"")

    .directive(""deleteBtn"", function(delConf) {
        require: ""?ngModel"",
        link: function(scope, elm, attr, ngModel) {
            elm.bind(""click"", function(e) {
                // here i open a modal window and pass some data to it
                // just as a delete confirmation the logic for it is tucked 
                // away in delConf
            }
        }
    })

    .directive(""deleteConfBtn"", function(delConf) {
        require: ""?ngModel"",
        link: function(scope, elm, attr, ngModel) {
            elm.bind(""click"", function(e) {
                // here i make the api request to delete the item and remove it
                // from the scope
            }
        }            
    });
</code></pre>

<p>The first directive is applied to the delete button in the table (This one will always work, even when the view changes). The second directive is applied to a button on a bootstrap modal window.</p>

<p>The second directive will only work after a page refresh. I think its to do with scope but I can't figure out why one works and the other fails.</p>

<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>First of all, is it right to change correlation with phase?</p>

<p>Secondly, how can I avoid repeated correlation coefficients? </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Changing <code>i</code> to <code>linspace(0,.5,20)</code> seems to remove repeated coefficients.</p>

<p>But unfortunately the result looks quite strange. The lenghts are in fact logarithmic but the angles behave strange in some regions.</p>

All the images use lower resolution representations, and my application is much more responsive when panning and zooming large numbers of images.</p>

<p>However, within my application I also provide the user the ability to resize layers with a resize handle. Before I converted image layers to use CATiledLayers I was doing layer resizes by manipulating the bounds of the image layer according to the resize delta (mouse drag), and it worked well. But now with CATiledLayers in place, this is causing CATiledLayers to get confused when I mix resizing of layers through bounds manipulation and zooming/unzooming the workspace through scale transforms. </p>

<p>Specifically, if I resize a CATiledLayer to half the width/height size (1/4 the area), the image inside it will suddenly scale to a further 1/2 the resized frame leaving 3/4 of the frame empty. This seems to be exactly when the inner CATiledLayer logic gets invoked to provide a lower resolution image representation. It works fine if I don't touch the resize handler and just zoom/unzoom the workspace.</p>

<p>Is there a way to make zooming/resizing play nice together with CATiledLayers, or am I going to have to convert my layer resize logic to use scale transforms instead of bounds manipulations?</p>

In this case I want to have a static dictionary</p>

<p>Just a simple example of what I'm looking for:</p>

<pre><code>class dTest:
    # item I want to be static
    d = {""First"":1}

&gt;&gt;&gt; a = dTest()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.d
{'First': 1}
&gt;&gt;&gt; dTest.d[""Second""] = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.d[""Third""] = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.d
{'Second': 2, 'Third': 3, 'First': 1}
&gt;&gt;&gt; dTest.d
{'Second': 2, 'Third': 3, 'First': 1}
</code></pre>

<p>Now if I directly call the class and replace d with a new dictionary</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dTest.d = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.d
{}
</code></pre>

<p>However I'd also like to have the same functionality if I replace a.d with a new dictionary</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.d = {""Fourth"":4}
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.d
{'Fourth': 4}
&gt;&gt;&gt; dTest.d
{}
</code></pre>

<p>My desired result right now would be for dTest.d to be the same to a.d (dTest.d being {'Fourth': 4}).</p>

<p>Is there a proper practice for this, or do I have to just make sure I only ever edit the object if I do it from an instance of dTest?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

All I really want to do is to <strong>call an objective C method from javascript</strong>. I'm sure there's a way to do this without having to send paramters back and forth as suggested in many answers and <a href=""http://ramkulkarni.com/blog/calling-objective-c-function-from-javascript-in-ios-applications/"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorials</a>. The purpose of this is for the users of my phonegap app to be able to click a HTML button to <strong>hide the status bar</strong>. For this to happen, I have to <strong>find a way to tell my app to run my objective C method</strong>: <code>HideStatusBar</code></p>

<pre><code>-(void) HideStatusBar {
  [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:NO withAnimation:UIStatusBarAnimationSlide];
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't want to send any parameters, all I ask you to explain to me is how to tell obj c to make the method call from javascript. I know one solution is to <strong>set parameters into the webviews address field</strong> and then fetch via obj C but I'm sure there are easier solutions in my case.</p>

<p>I started off by <strong>trying to write a phonegap plugin</strong> but I <em>never got the ""message accross"" to ""the other side""</em>, hence the method call in objective C never happened for some reason. I can post the code here if you like but I figured there must be a simpler solution.</p>

<p>Can anyone please explain to me <strong>the simplest way to call a obj c method from within javascript</strong>?</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>I got this working but the <code>shouldStartLoadWithRequest</code> only gets called when the webview is first loaded (as hinted in the title). This means that if i update the URL, the method does not get called. This is how I do it now:</p>

<p><strong>Javascript</strong></p>

<pre><code>('#hideStatusBar').live('click',function(event) {
    window.history.pushState('page2', 'Title', '/doc.html://hideStatusBar');
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Objective C</strong></p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)webView:(UIWebView *)webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request
 navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType {

//NSString *currentURL = request.URL.absoluteString;

if([request.URL.absoluteString isEqualToString:@""http://domain.com/doc.html://hideStatusBar""]){
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:YES withAnimation:UIStatusBarAnimationSlide];
    return NO;
}
return YES;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As said, I want this method to be ran every time i update the URL of my HTML doc via javascript. Any further ideas?</p>

"28725037","1","28728574","","2015-02-25 17:00:53","","2","135","<p>I'm using ASP.NET MVC to separate my HTML views from my Models. However there's a specific situation that is confusing me slightly.</p>

<p>I have several commonly used small panels of information, which themselves are comprised of a number of smaller panels of information. these get their data from a subclass contained within the various models, sometimes single instances, sometimes lists of objects.</p>

<p>At present this is done using Partial views, passing the appropriate piece of data via the model parameter, as such:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.Partial(""UserInfo"", this.Model.CurrentUser);
@Html.Partial(""UserInfo"", reply.PostedBy);
</code></pre>

<p>And so on. This all works fine.</p>

<p>I've recently hit a requirement which feels like it stretches sensible limits for this model however - it will involve a very large number of partial views with a TINY amount of HTML in each, nested numerous times. The page resolution time seems to be starting to get a little out of hand, and I suspect the amount of searching for and reflecting partial views might have something to do with it.</p>

<p><em>Please note:</em> I'm assuming duplicating HTML which is supposed to be the same is still to be avoided. I could simplify the nest by having copies of HTML in some of the higher level controls, but it strikes me this damages maintainability.</p>

<p>For the inner most ones it would seem to make more sense to me to create static helper classes which generate and return the required HTML - however, despite the fact MVC itself does it with the <code>Html</code> helper class, it feels like this goes against the MVC pattern.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is it OK to use static helper classes to generate small HTML snippets?</strong></li>
<li>Where should the static <code>UserInfo</code> class go? Views? Controllers? Elsewhere?</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously this approach still separates the helper method from the model, but as it takes a model in to work with, I don't really see how uncoupled it really is.</p>

<p>A static helper is a hairs breadth away from an extension method, consumable in a <code>userInstance.InfoHtml()</code> type of way, which just seems to make the whole approach really similar to just adding the helper method to the model. This is of course what MVC is trying to get away from in the first place!</p>

<p><em>Please note:</em> I'm not trying to sneak around the rules or complain! I just want to approach this as ""on pattern"" as possible. If lots and lots of partial views is the way, I'll stick with that and performance tune as best I can.</p>

<p>The text editor that I am creating has margins on all sides, and I would like to have the text wrap once it hits the end of a &lt;p&gt; tag. I would like to have the user be able to place as many spaces in the document without them being compressed.</p>

<p>Currently, I have <b>white-space:pre-wrap;</b> , but any line breaks in the code for the document also cause line breaks in the document. These line breaks are caused by a document converter that I have, and I would not like to modify it, unless it is absolutely necessary. Though I am not absolutely sure, I highly doubt that Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Safari all avoid placing line breaks in the code. Therefore, I see that my best option may be to set the white-space property.</p>

<p>From what I have read about white-space:pre-line, it sounds like the EXACT opposite of what I would like, where it collapses spaces, and breaks on code line breaks;</p>

1. The server has to open N connections to the known client and the client can only use those connections to request data from the server.</p>

<p>So far I tried to do the following but ran into some issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have a socket listener on the client and have it enqueue each connection received into a ArrayBlockingQueue.</p></li>
<li><p>Client app will use connections available in the queue above to request data from server</p></li>
<li><p>I create one thread(worker) per socket on the server and listen for data requests through N worker threads.</p></li>
<li><p>when I wait for incoming requests in the worker threads(on sever) I use InputStream.isAvailable() to check if there is something waiting to be read.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Issue: the worker threads on the sever side don't know if socket connection is still live or not? They continue to listen for requests even after the sockets are closed on the client app.</p>

<p>How can I make my server sense if the socket connection is still live or not ?</p>

<p>Am I taking the right approach here?</p>

<p>Is there a framework out there which will make the implementation easier and better ?</p>

<p>Back in 2004 I wrote an online Learning Management System using Classic ASP and VBScript. I'm now working on some upgrades (and periodically asking myself WTF I was thinking when I wrote various segments of code...), and I want to take this opportunity to resolve one of the frequent complaints I get - the size of the verification numbers.</p>

<p>When you complete a test online, a verification number is displayed so if you needed to re-create your certificate of completion (its a hospital, and trying to get them to get rid of their paper is like asking Linus to give up his blanket) you can enter the number, etc. etc.</p>

<p>At the time I wrote it (and sadly still to this day) there is no unique identifier I can use to create a transcript page - so please don't post suggestions to that end. There's more going on than I care to get into, and I want to head off valid suggestions that I can't use. ;)</p>

<p>The verification number is a concatenation of various pieces of information (mostly because when I first wrote it I was an idiot newb and SO wasn't around), and while it is a much-appreciated feature there are a lot of complaints about how long the number is. Returning the raw ID at this point is no better as we're in the 6-digit range.</p>

<p>My initial idea was to use a Base64 encoding algorithm I got from elsewhere, but given the problems I've had with just numbers, I'm thinking changing it to a case-sensitive value is only asking for a different class of problems... which brings me to the question at hand:</p>

<p>What can I use to create the shortest possible case-insensitive verification number since hex won't reduce the length appreciably?</p>

<p>And as the tags indicate, I need to be able to implement it in ASP Classic/VBScript - migration is not an option at this point.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> based on the answers, I found a link to Crockfor's implementation of Base32, which looks like what I'm looking for - <a href=""http://www.crockford.com/wrmg/base32.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crockford.com/wrmg/base32.html</a></p>

<p>I'm trying to create a Flex application that can automatically shrink based on the size of the components that it contains, so that a user can shrink it to a minimal view to see more of the HTML page it's embedded in.</p>

<p>I know how to change the size of the whole application using ExternalInterface, but I'm having trouble automatically figuring out how much the size changed when something is hidden or shown.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Let's say I have the following flex layout:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
    &lt;mx:Application xmlns:mx=""http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml"" layout=""vertical""&gt;

                paddingLeft=""0"" paddingRight=""0"" horizontalGap=""0"" id=""mainVBox""&gt;
             &lt;mx:HBox&gt;            
                 &lt;mx:Button label=""hide-show b"" click=""{showHideB()}""/&gt;
             &lt;/mx:HBox&gt;

             &lt;mx:Text id=""a"" text=""a"" fontSize=""42"" textAlign=""center""/&gt;
             &lt;mx:Text id=""b"" text=""b"" fontSize=""42"" textAlign=""center""/&gt;

     &lt;/mx:VBox&gt;
 &lt;/mx:Application&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How can I hide one of the text fields and cause the VBox to shrink?  I'm currently setting it to visible = false, but that doesn't seem to affect the parent VBox.</p>

<p>Once the VBox shrinks, how can I detect that the Application no longer needs so much space, and then go about figuring out how much less space it needs?</p>

<p>I've tried using ResizeEvent, but I haven't been able to get them to work, but I could be doing something wrong.</p>

<p>According to my current analysis it seems like the problem is related to the source folder structure and how the application is initialized.</p>

<p>I have the following structure:</p>

<p>project/app/{play controllers and models etc.}
project/src/{my project specific classes implementing the business logic}</p>

<p>When starting the play application I also start up jobs in my ""src"" folder (from outside of the play managed application classes). What seem to happen is that models and other classes accessed by these jobs gets loaded with the default class-loader at this time, and when I try to use these from the play application classes (the view etc.) I get this error telling me that the classes used are created with different class-loaders and therefore have different signatures.</p>

<p>So in conclusion both the default class loader and the play class loader load the same classes and depending on how I invoke them I get errors for the miss-match.</p>

<p>I have been able to solve this by simply moving all my source files into the project/app/ source folder but I would like to keep the src folder separate from the play application folder.</p>

<ol>
<li>Does anybody know if I am correct in my analysis? </li>
<li>If ""yes"" on 1., is there a way to configure play to not only load classes from the app folder but also from my src folder?</li>

<p>This happens when editing both Java and XML files. In other programs I don't have this problem. Is there some kind of setting I changed with some shortcut?</p>

<p>I am working on a school project where I want to be able to take pictures or access the tablet's picture gallery, as I like to have the option to save images captured with the tablet in a MySQL database.</p>

<p>However, I can not get this part to work. It's as if I do not have permission to connect to the tablet api.
The app (android) is built in dreamweaver using JQuery Mobile. To connect to the tablet api I want to use PhoneGap Build.
I have chosen to not to use the built-in function in DW to upload to PhoneGap, because I just think it gives more problems. Instead I just making a zip file and upload on their website.</p>

<p>My first question is if I have misunderstood the use of PhoneGap Build. I have read in a lot of places that you have to use Eclipse with PhoneGap, is it really necessary to activate my tablet's camera?
I would like to stick to HTML / css / JS because that's what I know best, instead of having to use Java.</p>

<p>This is my HTML code, </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div data-role=""content""&gt;   
    &lt;div data-role=""content"" id=""content"" data-theme=""a""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""ui-block-a""&gt;&lt;div data-role=""button"" onClick=""take_pic();""&gt;Take a Picture&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;img id=""cameraImage"" src="""" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /content --&gt;


&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" charset=""utf-8"" src=""JS/camera.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is my camera.js file which I call the end of the page</p>

<pre><code>function take_pic() {
navigator.camera.getPicture(onPhotoDataSuccess, function(ex) {
    alert(""Camera Error!"");
}, { quality : 30, destinationType: destinationType.DATA_URL });
}

function album_pic() { 
navigator.camera.getPicture(onPhotoURISuccess, function(ex) {
        alert(""Camera Error!""); }, 
        { quality: 30, 
    destinationType: destinationType.FILE_URI,
    // Android Quirk: Camera.PictureSourceType.PHOTOLIBRARY and 
    // Camera.PictureSourceType.SAVEDPHOTOALBUM display the same photo album.
    sourceType: pictureSource.SAVEDPHOTOALBUM });
}

Everything seems to be working fine, but I need the plugin to be able to call functions and access variables in main application, not just the other way around. I have an http wrapper class that will monitor net usage etc.. for the main app. The plugin would call http wrapper from the mother application. </p>

<p>How can I accomplish this? Do I need to define a class with all the available functions/variables? I will also need the plugin to generate GUI, so that user can set some settings for it.</p>

<p>This is what I got so far:</p>

<p><strong>Main Application:</strong></p>

<pre><code>namespace MainApplication
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        List&lt;iPlugin&gt; PLUGIN_LIST = new List&lt;iPlugin&gt;();

        public void LoadPlugins()
        {
            // load plugins..
        }

        // how do I call this function from a plugin?!
        public void HTTP()
        {
            // do some networking stuff..
        }

        private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            LoadPlugins();
        }


    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Plugin Interface:</strong></p>

<pre><code>namespace PluginInterface
{
    public interface iPlugin
    {
        string GetPluginName();

        void callHTTP();

        void SerVar(string var);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The Plugin:</strong></p>

<pre><code>namespace MyPlugin
{
    public class Main : iPlugin
    {
        string variable = """";

        public string GetPluginName()
        {
            return ""MyPlugin"";
        }

        public void callHTTP(){
            MainApplication.HTTP(); // call HTTP in main application
        }

        public void SerVar(string var)
        {
            variable = var;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, when I followed the tutorial, plugin interface was a seperate project, which I had to 'add as reference' in both MainApplication and myPlugin. Does that mean that my application and plugin are dependent on pluginInterface.dll? or it is just needed for development? if they're depended in runtime, how can I define it in both, my app and plugin, so that I don't have to use extra dll? Hope that makes sense, Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Full MainApplication code</strong></p>

<pre><code>public interface iPlugin
{
    string GetPluginName();

    string GetInformation();

    void SerVar(string var);
}

        List&lt;iPlugin&gt; PLUGIN_LIST = new List&lt;iPlugin&gt;();

            string path = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetModules()[0].FullyQualifiedName;
            string pluginDir = Path.GetDirectoryName(path) + ""\\Plugins"";

            {
                // THIS LINE GIVES THE ERROR
                Type[] pluginTypes = Assembly.LoadFile(s).GetTypes();

<p><strong>An example in C:</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void GetPointer(int* p) {
  p = malloc( sizeof(int) );
  if(p) {

    *p = 8;
     printf(""IN GetPointer2: %d\n"",*p);
  } else {
    printf(""INVALID PTR IN GetPointer2"");
  }
}

int* GetPointer3(void) {
  int* p = malloc(sizeof(int));
  if(p) {
    *p = 9;
    printf(""IN GetPointer3: %d\n"",*p);
  } else {
    printf(""MALLOC FAILED IN GetPointer3\n"");
  }
  return p;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  (void) argc;
  (void) argv;
  int* ptr = 0;
  GetPointer(ptr);
  if(!ptr) {
    printf(""NOPE\n"");
  } else {
    printf(""NOW *PTR IS: %d\n"",*ptr);
    free(ptr);
  }

  int* ptr2 = malloc(sizeof(int));
  GetPointer2(ptr2);
  if(ptr2) {
    printf(""NOW *PTR2 IS: %d\n"",*ptr2);
    free(ptr2);
  }

  int* ptr3 = GetPointer3();
  if(ptr3) {
    printf(""NOW *PTR3 IS: %d\n"",*ptr3);
    free(ptr3);
  }

<p><strong>The output:</strong></p>

<pre><code>IN GetPointer: 7
NOPE
IN GetPointer2: 8
NOW *PTR2 IS: 8
IN GetPointer3: 9
NOW *PTR3 IS: 9
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the first pointer will only have ""value"" inside the <code>GetPointer</code> method. Why using <code>malloc</code> inside lasts only for the lifetime of the method?</p>

<p>I tried this in C++ and got the same behaviour. I thought it would retain its value, but no. I found a way through, though:</p>

<pre><code>void GetPointer(int*&amp; p) {
  p = new int;
  if(p) {
    *p = 7;
     printf(""IN GetPointer: %d\n"",*p);
  } else {
    printf(""MALLOC FAILED IN GetPointer\n"");
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In C I can't do this trick. Is there a way to do the same in C or I have to be careful and ""malloc"" the pointer before attempting to give it a value?</p>

<p>I was instructed to do this with an embedded style sheet. What I did was wrap each 'slice' within a div (so I may set each slice's width) and then wrap all those divs into a div with an id ""images"".</p>

<p>Now, inside, at the bottom of my head I have the following code:</p>



<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;style type=""text/css""&gt;
    #images {
        float: right;
        clear: right;
        margin: 0em 0em 0em 2em
    }
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the image is put together, as in, no gaps in-between, but all of the images aren't floating properly to the right. In fact, it looks as though the slices are kind of left-aligned. If they were right aligned it would look proper.</p>

<p>Also, the book asks to apply a style to ""inline images"". This is easy to do with paragraphs, headings, and addresses, but how would I apply a style to inline images other than using a ton of divs like I just did?</p>

<p>As requested here's the code for the div of images:</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;div id=""images""&gt;
      &lt;div style=""width:6.7em""&gt;&lt;img src=""king1.gif"" alt=""""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div style=""width:7.85em""&gt;&lt;img src=""king2.gif"" alt=""""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div style=""width:11.45em""&gt;&lt;img src=""king3.gif"" alt=""""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div style=""width:14.25em""&gt;&lt;img src=""king4.gif"" alt=""""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div style=""width:15.5em""&gt;&lt;img src=""king5.gif"" alt=""""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div style=""width:16.6em""&gt;&lt;img src=""king6.gif"" alt=""""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I tried the following to no avail:</p>

<pre><code>img {
    float: right;
    clear: right;

<p>According to the app engine <a href=""http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/blobstore/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>, the way to upload files is to present the user with a form that posts to a dynamic url that was generated before the form was rendered (e.g. <a href=""http://mysite.com/_ah/upload/ag5kZXZ-aGVsbG93b3JsZHIbCxIVX19CbG9iVXBsb2FkU2Vzc2lvbl9fGB0M"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mysite.com/_ah/upload/ag5kZXZ-aGVsbG93b3JsZHIbCxIVX19CbG9iVXBsb2FkU2Vzc2lvbl9fGB0M</a>)</p>

<pre><code>  config.before(:suite) do
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
    DatabaseCleaner.clean_with(:truncation)
    DatabaseCleaner.start

  config.after(:suite) do

</code></pre>

<p>Now, this configuration works fine, so long as every last spec that is run either passes or fails. </p>

<p>However, in the event of an error (rspec doesn't give you a nice little <code>E</code> like minitest, it throws this sort of thing:</p>

<pre><code>09:17:32 - INFO - Running: spec
/usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p392/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activerecord-4.0.1/lib/active_record/validations.rb:57:in `save!': Validation failed: Email has already been taken (ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid)
</code></pre>

<p>), the database isn't cleaned! Residual data from the spec just before the error stays in the database. I suppose this is because database_cleaner doesn't regard the erroneous spec as finishing and so doesn't clean the database.</p>

<p>Now, this doesn't really cause any harm until you run your specs again. The residual data then causes an error analogous to this:</p>

<pre><code>09:17:32 - INFO - Running: spec
/usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p392/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activerecord-4.0.1/lib/active_record/validations.rb:57:in `save!': Validation failed: Email has already been taken (ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid)
</code></pre>

<p>Getting around this error is simple enough; running <code>rails_env=test rake db:reset</code> or firing up your database shell and emptying the relevant tables with sql statements will clear this data and allow the specs to be run without a hitch.</p>

<p>However, this is getting annoying. One wrong character in any of my specs (anything to make it erroneous rather than a failure) causes my whole testing workflow to jam up, almost like the firing mechanism of an automatic weapon!</p>

<p>What are your suggestions regarding database_cleaner? Do you have any example configurations that allow for the database to be cleaned, even in the event of an erroneous test?</p>

<p>If I bypass using the overlay, I'm able to use form.submit just fine - but once I include it in onClose event, then it doesn't submit. Just seeing if anyone sees anything glaring.</p>

<p>I have videos from many different sources and the duration was imported into the database without being standardized. I am looking to standardize the duration here.</p>

<p>Consider the following table structure:</p>

<pre><code>+-----------+
| Duration  |
+-----------+
| 5h58m38s  |
| 22m59s    |
| 05m29s    |
| 06m09s    |
| 00m06s    |
| 00m00s    |
+-----------+
</code></pre>

<p>I want to convert this format: 00m00s into hh:mm:ss.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>22m59s should be 00:22:59
5h58m38s should be 05:58:38
</code></pre>

<p>How can i do this in MySQL?</p>

<p>I tried using the query:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE table SET duration = sec_to_time(duration);
</code></pre>

<p>This did not work and I am lost. All comments and answers are greatly appreciate, thank you so much!</p>

<p>I have the app working correctly, but I've seen that if I raise the number of threads I use to process messages, my avg number of messages is at one level (I use performance counters to measure this), and I get the system to utilize, say, 50% of the CPU time available (I have an Core i7 820QM with 4 physical cores and 8 logical cores), but if I instead of raising threads, launch the same number of processes, I do get to use 100% of the CPU time, and get a much higher number of average events processed.</p>

<p>I have ansible scripts for setting up and deploying to new web servers as well as ansible scripts for spinning up new build boxes. My point of confusion is, where should I keep ssh keys and stuff like that necessary for the build process?  I have a read-only ssh key from GitHub for pulling down my repos onto the build box(es) that I'm fine storing in my devops repo, but what about the keys the build box needs to deploy to the production servers? I can't imagine it's a good idea to keep that in any kind of repo anywhere. Is it safe to leave it on the build box itself? What about secure storage in case you need to spin up a new build box or the old one fails? Does s3 make sense for this?</p>

All other rules up to this point work fine with no apparent syntax errors within the stylesheet.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I use NetBeans which shows no indication of errors and finds the rules just fine as normal. To avoid the possibility of spelling errors I let NetBeans find the rule and auto-fill it.</p>

<p>Research into limits suggest that I am well within the boundaries of any limit but I created a new stylesheet just to test. I added a rule with all the necessary declarations I tried before and the new stylesheet worked. This was along with the original stylesheet. However, if I add another rule it wouldn't work. Only the original rule I added will work, any other additional rule will not work including if I remove the original rule entirely.</p>

<p>Any inline styles I create work just fine and any modifications to previous rules take affect. I don't have any idea where to go from here as the issue doesn't seem to happen with any kind of consistency. Does anybody have any suggestions?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I made an interesting discovery. My way of importing CSS is as such for all pages:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""./primary.css""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I tried @import with same malfunctioning results. <strong>However</strong>, if I include the file via PHP all rules work as expected:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php require_once('./primary.css'); ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any possible explanation for this? The main difference is that now all the rules are on-page rather in a file, meaning the problem is in how the file is handled.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>Following suggestions from FelipeAls I began mass-commenting large portions of code to find problem areas. New rules worked when others were commented out; <em>however</em>, as I slowly re-introduced code there was no such problem area and once all code was available the problem no longer existed. This has lead me to believe there could have been a rogue comment someplace, a possible error with white space, or a line return. Either way the code works as it is supposed to once more.</p>

I need to show progress of a process back to the user.  I would love to use WebSockets but I have to support all the way back to IE8.  Since I can't use WebSockets am I stuck using a JavaScript <code>setTimeout</code> and doing pings? Are there any new techniques out there I haven't heard of yet?  I'm looking for a solution (not a detailed solution, just a name of a technique or technology I haven't heard of yet if there is one) that doesn't involve so much network traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Long version:</strong>
I have a handful of progress bars in my application.  They work by doing a <code>$.post</code> to start some process.  That process does it's job and along the way it sets a few session variables stating it's progress, records processes, filesize, etc...  Immediately after that initial <code>$.post</code> I also start a ""heartbeat"" or ""ping"" process that goes and gets these session variables in order to show the user % complete, records processes, and current filesize.  It fires every 1/2 second so the user sees the progress bar increment smoothly, the number of records processed increments smoothly, and they see the size of the resulting PDF grow in real time.  Its been working great for years.  The front end of the ping process looks like this...</p>

<pre><code>function rptCheckProgress(id)
{
    jQuery.ajax({
        async:false,
        cache:false,
        url: 'rpt.cfc?method=rptCheckProgress&amp;rptId='+id,
        success: function(data)
        {
            jQuery('#libRptProgress').html(data);
            if (!gStopHeartBeat) setTimeout(""rptCheckProgress(""+id+"");"", 500);
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have to implement more scenarios like this that require a ""ping"" to show progress.  I really hate doing so many mini pings especially since the networks where our software is used is VERY slow but I don't know of another way.  I would love to use WebSockets but I have to support all the way back to IE8.  Since I can't use WebSockets am I stuck using a JavaScript <code>setTimeout</code> and doing pings?</p>

An imported library and precompiled DLL (.lib and .dll) are provided by the hardware vendor for my version of VC++ and I was able to implement them in C++ without any issue.</p>

<p>However, I ran into segmentation error at run time when the code is written as a mex(compiled with the same version of VC++). After some investigation with the VC++ debugger, the likely culprit seems to be the fact that one of the external dll functions returns the data type std::vector, and probably tries to dynamically allocate memory for the vector container somewhere inside the function. I know that if I use std::vector in my own mex function, everything works fine, but I suspect that the mex header itself wraps the std::vector container in my own code for memory management(?) as required for all dynamically allocated memory in mex codes, whereas it can't do the same for the pre-compiled .dll.</p>

<p>Now the question is: since I cannot modify the external .dll file and have no access to its source files, are there any ways to work with this external dll such that the dynamic memory becomes managed by MATLAB(perhaps a wrapper of some sort..?)...and thereby avoid the segmentation error and return the correct data? Or if my analysis is wrong please correct me too!</p>

<p>Please let me know if there are any ideas or hacks, thanks!</p>

<p>I am creating a food ordering system which consists of 2 main sections, the ""Food Menu"" and the ""Order List"". When user chooses an item from the food menu, it will be added to the a listbox control which represents the order list.</p>

<p>I have created a few custom objects: <code>Order</code>, <code>OrderLine</code>, <code>Item</code>, as well as a Collection class, <code>OrderLineCollection</code>, for ""OrderLine"". They look like the following:
</p>

<pre><code>public class Order
{
    public string ID { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateTime { get; set; }
    public double TotalAmt { get; set; }
    public OrderLineCollection LineItems { get; set; }
}

public class OrderLine
{
    public Item Item { get; set; }
    public double UnitPrice { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public double SubTotal { get { return unitPrice * quantity; } }
}

[Serializable]
public class OrderLineCollection : CollectionBase
{
    public OrderLine this[int index]
    {
        get { return (OrderLine)List[index]; }
        set { List[index] = value; }
    }
}

public class Item
{
    public string ID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public double UnitPrice { get; set; }
    public byte[] Image { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My <code>ListBox</code> control has a <code>DataTemplate</code> so that more details are shown for each item. The XAML as below:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Page x:Class=""FoodOrdering.OrderList""
      xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""

                    &lt;TextBlock Grid.Row=""0"" Grid.Column=""1"" Text=""x ""/&gt;
                    &lt;TextBlock Grid.Row=""0"" Grid.Column=""1"" Text=""{Binding quantity}"" Margin=""10,0,0,0""/&gt;

            &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
        &lt;/ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/ListBox&gt;
&lt;/Page&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>so when items are added, the ListBox will look like the below image:
<a href=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6322828/orderList.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6322828/orderList.png</a></p>

<p>In the code-behind, I have created a static variable <code>currentOrder</code> for storing the current order and it will be used by other classes/methods.</p>

<p>And every time its value is changed, the following stupid method <code>LoadCurrentOrder()</code> is called to refresh the ListBox view.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public partial class OrderList : Page
{
    public static Order currentOrder = new Order();
    public OrderList()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        LoadCurrentOrder();
    }

    public void LoadCurrentOrder()
    {
        lbxOrder.Items.Clear();
        foreach (OrderLine ol in currentOrder.LineItems)
            lbxOrder.Items.Add(ol);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is how can I bind the data in an elegant way (such as using <code>Resources</code> <code>ItemsSource</code> and so on) instead of using the above method, so that the ListBox will update automatically every time the value of the variable is changed?</p>

<p>I tried 
</p>

<pre><code>lbxOrder.ItemsSource = currentOrder; 
</code></pre>

<p>but it does not work as currentOrder is not a <code>System.Collections.IEnumerable</code> object.</p>

A: Both options launch the process but in the second one the child process stops working after a few seconds, however, if I inspect running processes (<code>ps aux | grep some.sh</code>), it is there (but doing nothing).

"218857","1","","","2008-10-20 15:38:51","","5","2570","<p>I have a class that contains a bunch of properties. It is a mistake by a programmer if they call ToString() on an object of that type. Take this example code:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

public class Foo
{
    public int ID = 123;
    public string Name = ""SomeName"";

    private string ToString() { return null; }
}

public class MyClass
{
    public static void Main()
    {
    	Foo myObj = new Foo();
    	WL(""I want this to be a compiler error: {0}"", myObj.ToString());
    	RL();
    }

    #region Helper methods

    private static void WL(object text, params object[] args)
    {
    	Console.WriteLine(text.ToString(), args);	
    }

    private static void RL()
    {
    	Console.ReadLine();	
    }

    #endregion
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could reason that if ID is what most people want written out as a string, then I should implement ToString so that it returns the ID. However, I believe that is a bad practice because programmers will ""accidentally"" get working code. A programmer using my class should specify what they want.</p>

<p>Instead, what I would like is if someone calls myObj.ToString() to have that show up as a compile time error. I thought I could do that by creating a private ToString() function, but that doesn't work.</p>

<p>The reason I brought this up is that we ended up with a query string that contained the fully qualified class name rather then an ID. </p>

<p>So the question is: <strong>Is there any way to ""hide"" the ToString() function so that calling it on an object of my class causes a compiler error?</strong></p>

So far so good, however after finally managing to save the binary search tree into a file, I have one bug. </p>

<p>Lets say I add 3 customers the first time. I then close the program, and when I reopen it I will find the same 3 customers in the tree. however, the next time I open the file, it gives me an error from one of my predefined errors,  which occurs when a node is not able to identity whether to go left or right, maybe because its empty or uncomparable. here are some code snippets. I aslo tried using other fileopen techniques other than a+b, and I had no such error, but by the way I designed my program, I need the append method or else only one record will save.</p>

<p>Customers are stored in Cstmr in the header:</p>

<p>Now let's suppose I am given the amount of times this request should be made, but I can't do them asynchronously but synchronously instead.</p>

<p>For instance, I am given the number 5, and I shall call <code>makeRequest()</code>, when it's done, I shall call it again, and when it's done, I shall call it again... I should end up calling it 5 times.</p>

<p>I'm no expert at JavaScript but I found it easy to handle asynchronous calls by the use of callbacks.</p>

<p>So, my <code>makeRequest()</code> function takes a <code>callback</code> argument that is to be executed when the request has succeeded.</p>

<p>Once in the database it's modified to the examples described before. I've tried different mysql collations and it doesn't change anything.</p>

<p>The oddest part about all this is that the ""pop_code"" keeps the ""-"" when inserted in the database. They are both varchar() 20 and 5 respectively.</p>

<p>I can't tell if it's a PHP issue, codeigniter issue, mysql issue, phpmyadmin issue. Does anyone have a clue?</p>

    # Some code here.

    public function __destruct() {

"17793289","1","29707156","","2013-07-22 17:02:39","","6","5132","<p>I am using requirejs + jquery + jqueryui. I have read TONS of examples of how to do this. I think I understand the various approaches and it seems to me that my setup should be working correctly. However, I occasionally get a <strong>$.widget is not defined</strong> error in my custom modules that depend on jquery-ui. It is a pain because it is inconsistent and hard to reproduce so it is hard for me to test alternative approaches.</p>

<p>I am not shimming all of my jquery plugins because there are a lot. Instead, I am loading jquery with a separate requirejs call. Then, in the callback for that I load the rest of my stuff. This way I don't have to maintain a list of shims for all my jquery plugins.</p>

<p>For jquery-ui, I use a shim to make it depend on jquery. Then all my custom modules that use the widget factory have 'jquery-ui' in their dependency list.</p>

<p>In my templates...</p>

<pre><code>requirejs.config({
    baseUrl: ATHLETE.siteConfig.jsBaseUrl,
    paths: {
        'jquery': '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min',
        'jquery-ui': '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.16/jquery-ui.min'
    },
    shim: {
        ""jquery-ui"": ['jquery']
    },
    waitSeconds: 15
});

requirejs(['jquery'], function($) {
    requirejs(['site'], function() {
        requirejs(['mypage']);
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I am loading site.js before mypage.js. They have some shared dependencies. In my build config, I exclude site.js from mypage.js, therefore the shared dependencies are compiled into site.js and not mypage.js. Therefore, I need to completely load site.js before loading mypage.js or else require might try to load those shared dependencies separately.</p>

<p>Here's a sample custom module of mine that depends on jquery-ui.</p>

<pre><code>define([
    'jquery',
    'jquery-ui'
],function($) {
    $.widget('ui.viewAllSponsorsWidget', $.ui.dialog, {
        options: {
            autoOpen: false,
            dialogClass: 'view-all-sponsor-dialog-wrap',
            draggable: false,
            modal: true,
            resizable: false,
            width: 370,
            height: 400
        }
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>The error $.widget is not defined is caused by the 5th line of this and similar custom modules of mine. Again, it is really inconsistent and hard to reproduce. More often than not, I do NOT get the error, even when I clear my cache. <strong><em>Can anyone think of a way that line 5 could possibly be getting executed before jquery-ui is fully loaded?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE Aug 16, 2013</strong></p>

<p>I have been able to track this down a bit more.
I created a simple module that depends on jquery and jquery-ui.</p>

<pre><code>define([
    'jquery',
    'jquery-ui'
],function($) {
    console.log('$.widget is defined? ' + Boolean($.widget));
    console.log('jQuery.widget is defined? ' + Boolean(jQuery.widget));
});
</code></pre>

<p>The output of this is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>LOG: $.widget is defined? false
LOG: jQuery.widget is defined? true
</code></pre>

<p>So somehow the global jQuery object has widget defined, but the copy provided to me by requirejs does not.</p>

<p>So. my question is: Are there any differences when an absolute element is inside other absolute element ? If not, why every examples that I have read always just mention the case absolute element inside other relative element ?</p>

<p>thanks :)</p>

I'm only interested in 3 of the fields, so I'm skipping over the rest. Problem is that 2 of the fields are string contained in quotation marks, and one of them is actually optional. </p>

<p>For example, two successive lines might look like:</p>

<pre><code>0,,10004,10004,""Albany Hwy After Galliers Av"","""",-32.13649428,116.0176090070,3
0,,10005,10005,""Albany Hwy Armadale Kelmscott Hospital"",""Armadale Kelmscott Hospital"",-32.13481555555560,116.017707222222,3
</code></pre>

<p>Since I'm not interested in the strings (I'm only interested in a few of the numbers), I'm just skipping over them using the * operator in scanf. For the first string, it's easy, since that's a mandatory field, so I can just skip the first double quote match to a regex of everything up to the second double quote, like so:</p>

<pre><code>\""%*[^\""]
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm having trouble with is the second field, right after the first. The problem is that this field is optional; thus it may have text, it may not. Whenever it doesn't, the regex I listed above doesn't work properly, and the whole scanf operation fails for that line. Despite my best efforts, I cannot produce a regex that successfully matches everything up to the second double quotation mark, as well as matching empty strings. Does anyone know how I could modify my regex to perform such a function? </p>

<p>p.s. here is an example of what my scanf operation looks like:</p>

<pre><code>    res = sscanf(buf, ""%*d,,%ld,%*ld,\""%*[^\""]\"",\""%*[]\"",%lf,%lf,%*d"", &amp;cursid, &amp;curslat, &amp;curslong);

There are basically two rules:</p>

<li>Regardless of domain, select one specific module based on path</li>

I have done some dirty hacking in my bootstrapper where I check the domain and than execute <code>Zend_Layout::startMVC()</code> to get the correct layout, but that is messed up when I'm implementing custom routes.</p>

<p>OK I figured it out. I was using <code>false_type</code> and <code>true_type</code> as an argument to <code>enable_if</code> when I should have just used <code>bool</code>. :x</p>

<p>Further, I have decided that a <code>is_map_like</code> class would be better to check if <code>value_type</code> is like, <code>std::pair&lt;const Tkey, Tmapped&gt;</code>. So, my new traits class looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class Tcontainer&gt;
struct is_map_like
{
private:
    template&lt;class TvalueType&gt;
    struct test
    {
        static const bool bvalue = false;
    };
    template&lt;class TkeyType, class TmappedType&gt;
    struct test&lt;std::pair&lt;const TkeyType, TmappedType&gt;&gt;
    {
        static const bool bvalue = true;
    };
public:
    static const bool bvalue = test&lt;typename Tcontainer::value_type&gt;::bvalue;
};
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I want to create a <code>is_map_like</code> type traits class that checks for <code>key_type</code> and <code>mapped_type</code>. I am having a hard time building this. For now I'd like to just check for <code>key_type</code>. I have the following so far:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class T&gt;
struct is_map_like
{
private:
    template&lt;typename C&gt; static std::true_type test(typename C::key_type*);
    template&lt;typename C&gt; static std::false_type test(...);
public:
    typedef decltype(test&lt;T&gt;(0)) value;
};
</code></pre>

<p><code>value</code> here seems to always return <code>false_type</code>. As I understand, SFINAE should allow me to choose the right <code>test</code> overload based on whether <code>C::key_type</code> is accessible.</p>

<p>Here is how I'm testing: First, a struct that is specialized using <code>enable_if</code> on <code>is_map_like</code>:</p>

<pre><code>// a class that will be specialized only for map-like types
template&lt;class T, class Enable = void&gt;
struct MyStruct
{
    static void fn() { DebugLog(L""T is not a map type""); }
};
template&lt;class T&gt;
struct MyStruct&lt;T, typename std::enable_if&lt;is_map_like&lt;T&gt;::value&gt;::type&gt;
{
    static void fn() { DebugLog(L""T is INDEED a map type""); }
};
</code></pre>

<p>And here's how I call it at runtime:</p>

<pre><code>void test_is_map()
{
    MyStruct&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt;&gt;::fn();
    MyStruct&lt;std::map&lt;int, int&gt;&gt;::fn();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>T is not a map type
  T is not a map type</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What am I doing wrong? Why is the <code>test(typename C::key_type*)</code> not used even for the <code>map</code>, which indeed has a <code>key_type</code>? Or is the problem with my usage of <code>decltype</code>?</p>

<p>Allow user to upload an image, process this image (create multiple versions/sizes) in the background with sidekiq, then upload these versions + original to Amazon S3. This works fine. (Though I suspect this is probably a really inefficient/crappy way to do this, and I should be uploading directly using client-side javascript. But I don't know how to do that.) The user goes to a new photo page to upload a photo, and then gets redirected to the photo index page which shows all the photos. The problem is that since it takes a while to process the images, when the user is redirected to the index, the processing hasn't happened yet. Instead the user sees a 'processing image...' text where the image would be, based on a flag that is set on the image record. (I picked most of this up from a ryan bates railscast.) This is, obviously, not a great way to ingratiate to your users!</p>

<p>Is there any way to have the index page listen for the flag to be (un)set, or for something else to happen so that it will reload itself when it's ready to display the photo?

<p>As @Artjom said - there is should be zeroes values added to complete block. </p>

<p>This code in start adds zero values:</p>

<pre><code>        // Trim password
        var password = pass.stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet(NSCharacterSet.whitespaceAndNewlineCharacterSet())

        // Adding null padding

        for i in 1...count {
            password += ""\0""
        }

<p>Then use ""password"" var instead incoming ""pass"" to generate ""data""</p>

<p>And also remove Padding for options </p>

<p>I tried to do it by hand but finally i found <code>refract</code> from GLSL, which is documented in GLSL 1.1 like this:</p>

<pre><code>//For a given incident vector I, surface normal N and ratio of 
//indices of refraction, eta, refract returns the refraction vector, R. 
//R is calculated as:

k = 1.0 - eta * eta * (1.0 - dot(N, I) * dot(N, I));
if (k &lt; 0.0)
    R = genType(0.0); // or genDType(0.0)
else
    R = eta * I - (eta * dot(N, I) + sqrt(k)) * N;

//The input parameters I and N should be normalized in order to 
//achieve the desired result.
</code></pre>

<p>I wonder where these equations came from. I searched over the internet and books i own (Real Time Rendering bible, or Phisically Based Rendering last ed.) and all of them refer to this implementation, without explanation, or just tell the solution.</p>

<p>Trying to do it by hand from the begining using geometry brings me to other answers but obviously is hard work just for a very common function like GLSL's. So i prefer to use this optimiced notation.</p>

<p>I only have this:</p>

<pre><code>a.b = |a||b|cos(angle) (Dot product)
angleOut = eta * sin(angleIn) (Snell's Law).

As it stands I do have the framework to take the current <strong>MouseMove</strong> provided <strong>e.Location</strong> and converting to my world coordinates and back to screen - and the values match.  See below basic code overview.</p>

<pre><code>public void Scene_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    Vector2 world = ScreenToWorld(e.Location);

    ---&gt; Check here to make sure the world coordinates returned
         fall inside my grid scene edges.
    if (world.X &lt; Grid.Left) world.x = Grid.Left;

    Point target = WorldToScreen(world);

    // set cursr desired position
    Cursor.Position = (sender as PictureBox).PointToScreen( target );
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I am having is the fact that MouseMove is getting called <strong>AFTER</strong> the fact that mouse has moved, so when I hit the edges of my grid I see the mouse overshoot for a frame, and then correct itself.  This causes the cursor to jitter past the edges as I move the mouse.  I want to make it so when I hit the edge the cursor stops dead in its tracks, but I do not know how to capture the data prior to the mouse moving!</p>

<p>Perhaps I am going about this wrong, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>FYI - This is the first part of a SnapToGrid functionality I am trying to implement.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT : A simpler example:</strong></p>

<p>You can see my problem running the simple example below. Notice how the cursor flickers every frame as you move it around?</p>

<pre><code>bool g_Set = false;
public void Scene_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    // stop MouseMove from flooding the control recursively
    if(g_Set) { g_Set = false; return; }
    g_Set = true;
    Cursor.Position = new Point(400,400);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Does C# support anything in the API to capture <strong>MouseMove</strong> before it actually moves the Cursor, or should I just be looking into implementing my own Cursor class to hide the <strong>Form.Cursor</strong> and just render mine (something else I would need to look into as I have no clue on that functionality either). </p>

<p>My Rest services (created by the 2nd Spring context) have injection dependencies from the first app context. 
These injections obviously don't work. Curreetly I'm injecting them myself manually with some hacky code.</p>

<p>What is the correct way to inject Spring services for Rest request handling in an existing application, where 
jersey re-uses the existing context?</p>

"2102242","1","2102282","","2010-01-20 14:58:41","","1","85","<p>I was reviewing some today, when I encountered the following convention :</p>

<pre><code>TestParam(1);

function TestParam(p){
    var p = p + 1;
    alert(p);   // alerts '2'
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, obviously, the developer didn't mean to delcare 'p' within the function, instead maybe meaning: </p>

<pre><code>    p = p + 1;
</code></pre>

<p>But the code still worked, i.e. the value alerted was ""2"". So it got me to thinking. What would happen in the following scenario:</p>

<pre><code>var a = 1;
TestParam(a);
alert(a);  // alerts ""1""

function TestParam(p){
    var p = p + 1;
    alert(p);   // alerts '2'
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again the alerts were as I suspected (as intimated in the comments above). So then I was curious as to what would happen if I used an object:</p>

<pre><code>var a = { b: 1 };
TestParam(a);
alert(a.b);  //alerts 1

function TestParam(p) {
    var p = {b:p.b + 1};
    alert(p.b); //alerts 2
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, in this instance, JavaScript has 'remembered' the variable <code>a</code>, even though when it is passed to TestParam as <code>p</code>, <code>p</code> is redeclared.</p>

<p>Now if I were to have done the following within the function, then both alerts would have been ""2""</p>

<pre><code>    p.b++;
    //var p = {b:p.b + 1};
</code></pre>

<p>I.e. it would have modified the member <code>b</code> of the original object. I get this. Its the previous scenario that baffles me!</p>

<p>I realise this is quite a hypothetical question that is unlikely to carry much real-world usefulness, but it still made me quite curious, as to what is going on in the background, and how exactly JavaScript is scoping and referencing these variables.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<pre><code>jsonObject:

  { SomeThing  : 'SomeData'    },

  { WeaponList : [{""name"":""1337-b""},{""name"":""Roflcopter""},{""name"":""Shazam""},{""name"":""theb33f""]}
]
</code></pre>

<p>So, each <em>page</em> have to contain each one 3 <em>page items</em>. Each page has to have unique 3 page items, because this is used at our pagination system, and each <em>page</em> is a unique page that's being generated using that class.</p>

<p>I tried ng-repeat-start to generate for each page unique 3 pageItems, but I think it's not exactly what I'm looking for. I could do it with C# on server side, but I'm looking for a more pratical solution.
I tried also <a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/limitTo"" rel=""nofollow"">limitTo</a>, but I don't exactly see how can I use it in my situation.</p>

<p>Some have already answered, but as I said above, I already tried limitTo, and it does not work in my case, as it will repeat the same 3 <em>page items</em> for each <em>page</em>.</p>

<p>Can I do that with filters? Accordlingy to some answers, I can. But I really wanted a really simple solution. Does angular don't have anything that can slice my object, without needing of a filter to do so?</p>

<p>I guess I can explain better with the expected result.
The result could be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""myPageItem""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""divStyle""&gt;
         &lt;label class=""content""&gt;JohnSpartan&lt;/label&gt;

You can have multiple regions on the screen which means you can have multiple <code>ActivityManagers</code> and <code>ActivityMappers</code> (one per region). So, whenever there is a <code>PlaceChange</code> the <code>ActivityManagers</code> ask their respective <code>ActivityMapper</code> what activity it is supposed to be showing given the <code>Place</code>. This works great as long as your <code>Places</code> all have a common layout that they reuse in different ways to perform different activities. My question is how do we handle the case where different <code>Places</code> use radically different layouts? My first thought is to just have even more <code>ActivityManagers</code> and <code>ActivityMappers</code>, if the <code>Place</code> doesn't use a particular region then the <code>ActivityMapper</code> for that region will simply return <code>null</code> when we change to that <code>Place</code>. If there is a better way I would appreciate any wisdom.</p>

<p>I use the option ""simplify"" to prevent loops from appearing, but such function doesn't seem to work... I get the following error:</p>

<p>On another note, I don't want the output in .png format, but in .eps. I use the line:</p>

I had an implementation almost working but I couldn't figure out how to resize an array to hold more strings.</p>

<p>The original:
    char  *searchResults[maxResults];</p>

<p>Another function would malloc each searchResults[i] to the proper size when a hit was found.  This is how it would look with a couple search results:</p>

<pre><code>searchResults[0] = ""Result""
searchResults[1] = ""AnotherResult""
searchResults[2] = ""Someresulthere""
searchResults[3] = ""TheFourthresult""
searchResults[4] = ""YetAnotherOne""
</code></pre>

<p>After trying to reallocate it when it ran out of space, and failing, I turned to the internet and apparently you can't resize arrays. Fortunately, or so I thought I the time, a couple sites said to do:</p>

<pre><code>char **searchResults;

//initialize result list
searchResults = (char **) malloc( maxResults * sizeof(char *) ) ;
for (i = 0; i &lt; maxResults; i++) {
searchResults[i] = NULL ;
</code></pre>

<p>Well, that doesn't seem to work at all. I've spent a few hours trying to figure this out and now I'm just plain stymied. It will allocate 400 bytes for searchResults(maxResults is 100), and the address for searchResults[i] changes by 4 bytes, but nothing happens. If I malloc(100) to searchResults[i], it seems to to allocate the space but I still don't seem to be able to store anything except for one result at searchresult[0]. </p>

<p>When viewing searchResults it always looks like:</p>

<pre><code>searchResults[0] = ""someResult""
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas the first example is how it should look.  I'm thinking I'm doing something wrong, but I have no idea what.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>EDIT:  If you downvote, you could at least have the common courtesy to say why so I can provide clarification on whatever your point of discord is.</p>

<p>Anyways, here's an image showing the problem. I can't seem to assign any results except to the the first element and I don't know why.</p>

<p>for example, first i open a socket that represents a connection between Android client and windows 7 server.  i want to send an integer that is the size of the file by using DataOutputStream, then after this i will use BufferedOutputStream to send the binary file, such as a pdf</p>

<p>the server will get the size sent by the client and then check if the size of the file received is the correct size. it compares the send integer, file size number with the actual size of the file received.  if there is any difference than the server knows that the file is not complete and then it will send a message back to the client to request that the file be sent again.</p>

<p>i have an app where the file is received as incomplete about 5% of the time. it arrives smaller than the actual size.  the only way to fix this problem is to resend the file again if it is not complete</p>

<p>if i send a file, it is required to have a port open and waiting to receive a message back from the server telling the client if the file was received complete or has to be resent.</p>

<p>so is it possible to have one thread using the socket and listening for any messages and on another thread sending a message.  so that if a message is being received back from the server at the same time one is being sent.</p>

<p>it is clear that using only one thread will block and that two threads are needed but to use the same socket are there possible problems with this?</p>

Once I click the button, I want to load the user control and then call the control's <code>Initialize</code> method, passing a collection of objects I have stored in the page viewstate.</p>

<p>Here is the <code>RadToolTip</code> markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;telerik:RadToolTip runat=""server"" ID=""_MyToolTip"" HideEvent=""ManualClose"" 
    Position=""Center"" Width=""500px"" Height=""400px"" Animation=""Fade""
    ShowEvent=""OnClick"" ShowDelay=""0"" RelativeTo=""Element""
    TargetControlID=""_MySelectButton"" RenderInPageRoot=""True"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the <code>Click</code> event handler for <code>MyButton</code>:</p>

<pre><code>protected void _MySelectButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Control ctrl = Page.LoadControl(@""~/UserControls/MyUserControl.ascx"");

    var muc = (ctrl as MyUserControlClass);

    muc.Initialize(_MyViewStateCollection); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want it so that when <code>_MySelectButton_Click</code> fires, it will create a new instance of <code>MyUserControl</code>, and then that event will propagate up into the <code>RadToolTip</code> so that the tooltip appears, and then the user control within the tooltip. However, right now only the <code>RadToolTip</code> appears, with no user control within it.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://www.telerik.com/help/aspnet-ajax/tooltip-troubleshooting-common-issues.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this post</a> on Telerik's site which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Click events are not fired for a tooltipified element</strong></p>
  
  <p>The RadToolTip registers event handlers for the client-side events and
  therefore they cancel the further click propagation so that the
  tooltip remains visible, as a postback would hide it. <strong>This means
  that when the ShowEvent is set to OnClick elements such as Buttons,
  CheckBoxes, RadioButtons, LinkButtons may not fire their server events
  or even their client-side behavior may change</strong> (espeacially for the
  RadioButton and CheckBox - they will not change their states, as the
  click is cancelled). To avoid this set the ShowEvent to OnFocus or to
  OnMouseOver, for example. The same holds true for the
  RadToolTipManager as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the problem is that the button's <code>Click</code> is essentially incompatible given that the <code>RadToolTip</code> is preventing the click from propagating, how can I achieve the desired behavior? <strong>Bottom line, I want to be able to click a button, open a tooltip, then open my user control within that tooltip.</strong> Please help, thanks!</p>

<li><p>Center X Alignment</p></li>
<li><p>Horizontal Space</p></li>

"5657812","1","","","2011-04-14 02:08:51","","1","333","<p>In a django project I am trying to display the report like this:</p>

<pre><code>Heading:        Field1          Field2        Field3 of Type A    Field3 of Type B
Data:           Record1Value1   Record1Value2  Record1Value3
                Record2Value1   Record2Value2                  Record2Value3
                Record3Value1   Record3Value2  Record3Value3
</code></pre>

<p>Of which Record1Value1 and Record2Value1, Record3Value1 belong to a list of values1. It is a list of field values of objects in model. The same with list values2. Record1Value3 and Record3Value3 belong to a list of values3, but filtered by type=’type A’. Record2Value3 belong to a list of values3, filtered by type=’type B’. So in my views.py I code like below:</p>

<pre><code>objects=model.objects.filter(field=input,…)
values1=objects.values_list(field1, flat=True)
values2=objects.values_list(field2, flat=True)
objects3a= objects.filter(type=’type A’)
objects3b= objects.filter(type=’type B’)
values3a=objects3a.values_list(field3, flat=True)
values3b=objects3b.values_list(field3, flat=True)
functions=objects.values_list(type,flat=True)
</code></pre>

<p>In the html page, I use the following codes:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;th&gt;
&lt;td&gt; field1&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt; field2&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt; field3 of type A&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;field3 of typeB &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
{%for value1 in values1%}
{%for value2 in values2%}
{%for value3a in values3a%}
{%for value3b in values3b%}

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt; {{value1}}&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt; {{value2}}&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; 
{%if function==’type A’%}   
{{value3a}}
{%endif%}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; 
{%if function==’type B’%}   
{{value3b}}
{%endif%}
&lt;/td&gt;  
&lt;/tr&gt;
{%endfor%}
{%endfor%}
{%endfor%}
{%endfor%}
</code></pre>

<p>What I want to do is iterate over each record and put the field values of each record in corresponding cell, but for field3, if the ‘type’ field of the record is ‘type A’ then put the field3 value in the column ‘field3 of type A’, and leave ‘field3 of type B’ blank. Vice versa to type B. </p>

<p>The problem is that it is not really looping over each record this way. The block of codes:</p>

<pre><code>{%if function==’type A’%}   
{{value3a}}  
{%endif%}  
</code></pre>

<p>does not really work because it does not recognize function and value3a belong to the same object: objects3a. Do I have to write a forms.py to do this? If so, how? (Note that I can not declare objects in forms.py because I have to get user input in views.py)
Also, is there any way to simpilify the codes? These many forloops makes it almost impossible to load the data. </p>

<p>Hope someone could help me out! Thanks</p>

I wanted to setup logging for Solr, because I have some other issues, and I can't figure out. I hope that inside the logfiles, I get all the URLs my applications are sending to Solr.</p>

<p>I followed this guide <a href=""http://skybert.wordpress.com/2009/07/22/how-to-get-solr-to-log-to-a-log-file/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skybert.wordpress.com/2009/07/22/how-to-get-solr-to-log-to-a-log-file/</a> to enable Solr logging in it's own file. My problem is, that the file is created, but it's empty:</p>

<pre><code>-rw-r--r--  1 tomcat6 tomcat6     0 Aug 24 11:24 solr.2013-08-24.log
</code></pre>

<p>For the solr setup, I followed this guide: <a href=""http://jmuras.com/blog/2012/setup-solr-4-tomcat-ubuntu-server-12-04-lts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jmuras.com/blog/2012/setup-solr-4-tomcat-ubuntu-server-12-04-lts/</a></p>

<p>So, any ideas why solr isn't logging into the files? I'm using Solr through a DSL called sunspot with Rails 3. And because I have some issues with sunspot, I want to have a look in the Solr logs, what URLs are really called (and not what the sunspot DSL tells me ;) )</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I found some errors inside the <code>catalina.out</code>:</p>

<p>The author demonstrates this with some nice examples. However, based on that statement, I got this question that can't be answer by myself. As 'Function' constructor is a <strong>function</strong>, so 'Function' <strong>function</strong> is an <strong>Object</strong>, then 'Function' <strong>object</strong> needs another constructor function to build it and that another constructor function is again an Object (because it's a <strong>function</strong>).</p>

<p>Now I made some changes cuz I'm not using a navigation controller to load the custom image picker (but rather modally) which is created programmatically inside the .m file. So I made the FlipSideView the delegate for the custom image picker but still lost when I come to loading the view. I created a xib file and tried to connect it to the image picker but that didn't work. 
So I wonder what's the best way to do that?</p>

<p>Currently, I've decided to standardize the name of my .jar files. In many projects, the version of the .jar files appear in the name, e.g. richfaces-3.0.1.jar. Is it a good naming style or should I mention the version of the .jar file in its manifest? If it is better, should I use this style for my internal releaseses?</p>

<p><strong>My question is this:</strong>  After successfully receiving approx. 10 separate silent push notifications at a rate of one per hour, no more were delivered to our test app until it was finally opened by our test user.  Based on this it appears that iOS may stop delivering silent push notifications if it determines an app is not in use.  Is this expected behaviour?  Does anyone know any rough details about the heuristic used by Apple for this?</p>

<p><strong>Details of the testing for those interested</strong></p>

<p>FYI, our test set up is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>We have built a simple Notification test app (built for iOS7 using the <code>application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler</code> delegate method)</li>
<li>For the duration of the test the app was kept in suspended state in the background on our test iPhone 5 (sometimes in the office on wifi, sometimes on 3G in and around London).</li>
<li>We have a simple Ruby script using the Grocer gem (which seems very good incidentally) sending a silent push notification every hour to the app, via Apple's sandbox APNS gateway.  </li>
<li>When the app receives the notification it wakes up, writes a log and makes a simple request to our backend server, which also logs the event having occurred.</li>
</ol>

<p>Results:</p>

<ol>
<li>Everything works exactly as expected for the first 10 hours. After this no more notifications are received by the app.</li>
</ol>

<p>The notification format (manually copied out, excuse any errors):</p>

<pre><code>aps = {
  badge = 2;
  ""content-available"" = 1;
};

<p>After the dataCollection is fetched, I have a listener to crunch the data for each line.</p>

<pre><code>lineCollection.invoke('setData')

<p>However, this kind of freezes the browser. My next approach was to try to set a timeout to hopefully stop blocking the ui:</p>

<pre><code>lineCollection.each(function(model) {
  setTimeout(model.setData, Math.round(Math.random() * 20));

<p>This still sorta freezes the whole process. How can I tell the browser to crunch the data in the background? </p>

<p><em>Edit</em></p>

<p>""crunch the data"" in my case is to zip variable sets of ~3600 length arrays, average each slice, and format ~3600 date objects.</p>

var xs = _.map(times, this.formatTime);

var values = _.map(allSamples, function(samples) {

For products I already used HSQL as a database. And I integrated security by using roles which are hard coded in my applicationContext-security.xml like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;authentication-provider&gt;
            &lt;user-service id=""userDetailsService""&gt;
                    &lt;user name=""admin"" password=""admin"" authorities=""ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN"" /&gt;
                    &lt;user name=""username"" password=""password"" authorities=""ROLE_USER"" /&gt;
                    &lt;user name=""test"" password=""test"" authorities=""ROLE_USER"" /&gt;
            &lt;/user-service&gt;
    &lt;/authentication-provider&gt;

   Is there a way that I can take the xml file name as parameter and IN THE XSLT FILE, it load those xml files and transform them recursively?</p>

<p>Cause usually, xml and xslt are tied by giving the xslt name IN THE XML FILE like this.
   
   And this is a one to one relationship. 
   So is there some sort of doc function in xslt that can do the other way around: loading xml 
   files IN THE XSLT file in a one to many relationship?</p>

<p>Some example code will be highly appreciated!Thanks.</p>

I'm partly done, but when I tried to cross compile DAHDI (or direct compile with <code>build-essential</code> installed on BBB's ) to communicate my BBB with FXO Card, I figured out that there are some modules (<code>wctdm,wcfxo, ...</code>) can not be built as usual, though  wctdm.c, wcfxo.c exists in dahdi's origin source code<br/><br/>
I refer switchfin source code which is built for blackfined linux system, I see that they have some dahdi extra modules like <code>sport_interface bfsi ...</code> which is built with DAHDI_MODULES_EXTRA option at make time, and these extra module work for their blackfin board.<br/><br/>
So I'm wondering where to get these extra module which work for my BBB, particularly help me to connect my BBB to FXO Card.<br/> If they don't already exists, which knowledge do I need to get started writing a new one? Unfortunately, I'm an software engineer and I'm not so familiar with Hardware design, so if it relates to Hardware design, well, I'm willing to learn.<br/><br/>

"22565428","1","22566023","","2014-03-21 17:22:38","","0","440","<p>I'm digging in to custom casts for C# classes. This <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407689/how-do-i-provide-custom-cast-support-for-my-class"">StackOverflow question</a> gave me a head start, but my class has Type arguments in it. An example is below:</p>

<p>Say I have this class hierarchy for my Entities:</p>

<pre><code>public class Animal
{
}

public class Tiger : Animal
{
    public int NumberOfStripes { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(where Tiger has some properties that Animal does not).</p>

<p>Now, the class I'm trying to perform a custom cast on is similar to the one below (I'm using ASP.NET MVC as a side note)</p>

<pre><code>public class SomeViewModel&lt;T&gt; where T : Animal
{
    public T Animal { get; set; }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>When creating the edit forms for this class hierarchy, I need forms specific to an <code>Animal</code> sub class, but the instantiation of the actual <code>animal</code> is done using a <code>Type</code> object. At some point, I need to cast <code>SomeViewModel&lt;Animal&gt;</code> to <code>SomeViewModel&lt;Tiger&gt;</code> so I can use a strongly typed Razor view.</p>

<p>An example controller:</p>

<pre><code>namespace MvcProject.Controllers
{
    public class AnimalsController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult Create(int id)
        {
            AnimalType t = DbContext.AnimalTypes.Find(id); // get AnimalType object from database
            AnimalViewModel&lt;Animal&gt; model = new AnimalViewModel&lt;Animal&gt;()
            {
                Animal = (Animal)t.CreateInstance() // Returns a Tiger object cast to an Animal
            };

            return View(model);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my Razor view, I want to render a partial that is strongly typed to the <code>Tiger</code> class like so:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.Partial(""_TigerForm"", Model)
</code></pre>

<p>And the contents of the _TigerForm Razor partial:</p>

<pre><code>@model AnimalViewModel&lt;Tiger&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of Stripes: @Model.Animal.NumberOfStripes&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So couple of questions here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can you do this sort of type cast (from <code>AnimalViewModel&lt;Animal&gt;</code> to <code>AnimalViewModel&lt;Tiger&gt;</code>)?</li>
<li>What other options would be available that would not require type casting? I'd like to avoid a Dynamic view if possible.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edit #1</strong></p>

<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Animal&gt; a = new List&lt;Animal&gt;();
List&lt;Tiger&gt; b = (List&lt;Tiger&gt;)a;
</code></pre>

<p>Visual Studio still complains that it cannot cast the object. This seems to be the root of my problem.</p>

<p><strong>Edit #2</strong></p>

<p>This code does work though:</p>

<pre><code>Animal a = new Tiger();
Tiger b = (Tiger)a;

"20454542","1","","","2013-12-08 14:30:41","","0","1064","<p>I am working on developing a Qt application for windows platform. I am facing problem when using exception handling in class hierarchy.</p>

<p>I have Class B object instantiated in a function of Class A. When, due to some reason, an exception is thrown from Class B (and not caught in Class B) it is not being caught in Class A (appropriate try-catch block is present in Class A) and instead the application crashes showing some windows specific error. This type of try-catch mechanism in class hierarchy works perfectly fine in Java.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>This is piece of code of ClassA that is instatiating an object of ClassB (Qt Dialog)</p>

<pre><code>void Class A::on_pbCallB_clicked()
{
    try
    {
        objClassB = new ClassB();
        objClassB-&gt;show();
    }
    catch(QString *strExceptionMsg)
    {
        QMessageBox::critical(this,""Error"",*strExceptionMsg);
        exit(1);
    }
    catch(...)
    {
        QMessageBox::critical(this,""Error"",""Uknown Error"");
        exit(1);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When ClassB dialog is displayed and a button present on the dialog is pressed following piece of code is called:</p>

<pre><code>void ClassB::on_pbThrowExp_clicked()
{
    try
    {
        throw (new QString(""Throwing Exception !""));
    }
    catch(QString *strExceptionMsg)
    {
        throw strExceptionMsg;
    }
    catch(...)
    {
        throw (new QString(""Unknown Error""));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This throws an exception which is caught in ClassB's function but when thrown further it is not caught in ClassA (From where objClassB is instantiated) and the entire application crashes.</p>

<p>I have tried 1 solution where I have re-implemented QApplication’s <strong>notify</strong> method where, an exception thrown from somewhere in the application, if not caught anywhere, is being caught in re-implemented notify method. But doing this does not stop the application from closing down.</p>

<p>Please confirm if this is even possible in Qt/C++ and if not please point me in direction of an alternative (if available) in Qt.</p>

<p>It is almost as if Chrome has decided to redirect away to the link in the anchor before completing the JavaScript execution. I am not experiencing this problem in IE or FF.</p>

upper case means it is a NOT so for example the first part ZYXW means NOT z AND NOT y AND NOT x AND NOT w. I hope that makes sense.</p>

<p>So the problem is i found the answer for the expression which simplifies to 
a = z + x + yw + YW
however my simplification ends at a = zYX</p>

<p>bellow are the steps for my simplification, could someone identify the problem please.</p>

<pre><code>a = ZYXW + ZYxW + ZYxw + ZyXw + ZyxW + Zyxw + zYXw + zYXW
a = ZYXW + ZYxW + ZYxw + ZyXw + ZyxW + Zyxw + zYX(w + W)
a = ZYXW + ZYxW + ZYxw + ZyXw + ZyxW + Zyxw + zYX(1)
a = ZYXW + ZYxW + ZYxw + ZyXw + ZyxW + Zyxw + zYX.1
a = ZYXW + ZYxW + ZYxw + ZyXw + ZyxW + Zyxw + zYX

a = ZYXW + ZYxW + ZYxw + ZyXw + Zyx(W + w) + zYX
a = ZYXW + ZYxW + ZYxw + ZyXw + Zyx(1) + zYX
a = ZYXW + ZYxW + ZYxw + ZyXw + Zyx.1 + zYX
a = ZYXW + ZYxW + ZYxw + ZyXw + Zyx + zYX

a = ZYW(X + x) + ZYxw + ZyXw + Zyx + zYX
a = ZYW(1) + ZYxw + ZyXw + Zyx + zYX
a = ZYW.1 + ZYxw + ZyXw + Zyx + zYX
a = ZYW + ZYxw + ZyXw + Zyx + zYX

a = ZYW + Zw(xY + Xy) + Zyx + zYX
a = ZYW + Zw(x.1 + X.1) + Zyx + zYX
a = ZYW + Zw(x + X) + Zyx + zYX
a = ZYW + Zw(1) + Zyx + zYX
a = ZYW + Zw.1 + Zyx + zYX
a = ZYW + Zw + Zyx + zYX

a = Z(YW + w + yz) + zYX
a = Z(Y.1 + yz) + zYX
a = Z(Y = yz) + zYX
a = Z(z) + zYX
a = Z + z + zYX
a = 1 + zYX

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""hidden"" id=""geo_lat1"" name=""geo_lat1""&gt;
&lt;input type=""hidden"" id=""geo_lon1"" name=""geo_lon1""&gt;
&lt;input type=""hidden"" id=""geo_lat2"" name=""geo_lat2""&gt;

&lt;input type=""hidden"" id=""geo_lon3"" name=""geo_lon3""&gt;

<p>I also have the three input fields for the postcodes:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" name=""search_postcode1"" id=""search_postcode1""&gt;
&lt;input type=""text"" name=""search_postcode2"" id=""search_postcode2""&gt;
&lt;input type=""text"" name=""search_postcode3"" id=""search_postcode3""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The geocoding function I have works fine, but only for the first set of lat/longs. If I want to produce the lat/longs for the other two postcodes, I would have to copy and paste the geocoding function for each postcode, just changing the number at the end of the input name in the following line:</p>

<pre><code>var sAddress1 =document.getElementById(""search_postcode1"").value ;
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of copying/pasting I  want to use the same code but in a loop, which means changing the reference from search_postcode1 to search_postcode2 and search_postcode3</p>

<p>I know I can use join() to join data in an array and assign it to another variable like so:</p>

<pre><code>var a = new Array(""search_postcode"",""1"");
var pcname = a.join(""""); // pcname would be assigned ""search_postcode1""
</code></pre>

<p>My question is how do I assign it so that it would appear in the line of code above rather than a value in a variable?</p>

<hr>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>I also need to assign it to the hidden fields using:</p>

<pre><code>geo_lat1.value = loc[0];
geo_lon1.value = loc[1];
</code></pre>

<p>How do I change the '1's in this to a '2' and a '3' in a loop? It must be a different way to the getElementById(""search_postcode"" + ""1"") way?</p>

<p>When the click-once application above is installed, it creates a single file in the form of a shortcut which contains the following line only:</p>

<p><a href=""http://1code.codeplex.com/releases/clickonce/SampleBrowser.application#SampleBrowser.application,%20Culture=neutral,%20PublicKeyToken=48e4844f2d49c017,%20processorArchitecture=msil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1code.codeplex.com/releases/clickonce/SampleBrowser.application#SampleBrowser.application, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=48e4844f2d49d017, processorArchitecture=msil</a></p>

<p>Then, when this shortcut is double-clicked, a sort of browser application comes up, but it has no window borders and is very modern looking.  What type of technology is this?  I am including the WPF tag otherwise I am at my wit's end as to what it is.</p>

<p>(Wanted to include an image of the said application here but can't seem to upload an image as I am getting the following error: ""Failed to upload image; imgur is rejecting the request"")  Here's a link to that image: <a href=""http://imgur.com/B38P6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/B38P6</a></p>

<p>Is the fact that a class is called thread misleading?
I understand threads as an abstract concept which is a set of steps done by the processor that have an order and a meaning.
A java thread object however(as well as classes and structs form other programming languages) does not represent a thread entirely, as it passes control to monitors and does not execute the whole abstract thread.
Am I correct? Or am I understanding threads incorrectly?
(Obviously, I've read several definitions along the way including wikipedia but I'm still uncertain)</p>

<p>I use WAMP and have set up perfectly working Virtual Hosts in the past, but now I have come to something I never foresaw.</p>

<p>I am trying to do this:</p>

<p>Access C:\wamp\www through <a href=""http://localhost"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost</a></p>

<p>Access D:\somethingelse through <a href=""http://localhost:8080"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8080</a> OR <a href=""http://something.dev"" rel=""nofollow"">http://something.dev</a></p>

<p>I much prefer using the proper <a href=""http://something.dev"" rel=""nofollow"">http://something.dev</a>, as the working site is <a href=""http://something.co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://something.co</a>, and so I can keep them separate.</p>

<p>I have followed guides and read forum posts, but all I have manages to do so far is this:</p>

<p>Access C:\wamp\www through <a href=""http://localhost"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost</a> OR <a href=""http://something.dev"" rel=""nofollow"">http://something.dev</a></p>

<p>Access D:\somethingelse through <a href=""http://localhost:8080"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8080</a> OR <a href=""http://something.dev:8080"" rel=""nofollow"">http://something.dev:8080</a></p>

<p>Anybody got any idea how you would do this? Here's my VirtualHost Code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
DocumentRoot ""C:\wamp\www""
ServerName localhost
ServerAlias www.localhost.com
ErrorLog ""logs/localhost-error.log""
CustomLog ""logs/localhost-access.log"" common
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;VirtualHost *:8080&gt;
ServerAdmin webmaster@something
DocumentRoot ""D:/something/www""
ServerName something.dev
ServerAlias www.something.dev
ErrorLog ""logs/something-error.log""
CustomLog ""logs/something-access.log"" common
&lt;directory ""D:/something/www""&gt;
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride all
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
&lt;/directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And in httpd.conf I have this</p>

<pre><code>Listen *:80
Listen *:8080
</code></pre>

<p>And my hosts file is working and points both of these to 127.0.0.1</p>

<p>(The reason I want to do this is that when I code on my machine I use the <a href=""http://something.dev"" rel=""nofollow"">http://something.dev</a>, but I run Livereload Windows, and test my website simultaneously on an iPhone and iPad on the same local network, but without any access to iOS's equivalent of the hosts file.

<p>I'm more interested, at the moment, in what the actual direct cost of being finalizable is, both in memory terms, and in object allocation time. I've seen oblique references to the existence of such a cost in a number of places, for example, <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javamail/finalization-137655.html"">Oracle's article on finalization memory retention issues</a> notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When <code>obj</code> is allocated, the JVM internally records that <code>obj</code> is finalizable. This typically slows down the otherwise fast allocation path that modern JVMs have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How does the JVM record that an object instance is finalizable, and what are the memory and performance costs of doing so?</strong></p>

<p>For those interested in my specific application:</p>

<p>We produce and retain millions of incredibly lightweight objects; adding a single pointer to these objects is incredibly costly, so we've done a fair bit of work to remove pointers from them, instead using smaller numeric ids packed into a subset of the bits of a field. Unpacking the number allows the shared immutable property with that id to be retrieved from a Pool that stores them using a Map.</p>

<p>The remaining question is how to handle the garbage collection of property values that are no longer used.</p>

<p>One strategy that has been considered is using reference counting; when objects are created and retrieve the pooled id for a value, the reference count for that value is incremented; when it is no longer used, it must be decremented.</p>

<p>One option to ensure this decrement happens is to add the following finalize method:</p>

<pre><code>public void finalize() {
    Pool.release(getPropertyId());
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, if the very act of being finalizable means that an additional pointer to the object must be kept, the up-front cost of being finalizable would be considered high for this application. If it means additional objects must be allocated, it would almost certainly be too high...hence, my question: what is the direct up-front cost of being finalizable?</p>

<p>The 'offers' table has can match a record in the property table by either referring to a specific record by a unique code or by the county or region the property is located.</p>

<p>Here's an example of my query...</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *, ROUND(((3959 * acos(cos(radians(51.1080390)) * cos(radians(latitude)) * cos(radians(longitude) - radians(-4.1610140)) + sin(radians(51.1080390)) * sin( radians(latitude)))) * 2),0)/2 AS `distance`
FROM `properties` AS prop
LEFT JOIN `offers` ON prop.code = offers.the_property
LEFT JOIN `offers` AS offsCnty ON prop.county = offsCnty.the_county
LEFT JOIN `offers` AS offsRgn ON prop.region = offsRgn.the_region
HAVING distance &lt;= 2.5
ORDER BY `sleeps` ASC, `distance` ASC
LIMIT 0, 10
</code></pre>

<p>In the offers table the are 3 columns <code>the_property</code> / <code>the_county</code> / <code>the region</code> are crucial for linking the appropriate offer with the property/ies. If an offer is to be applied to the entire county, the field <code>the_property</code> is blank, otherwise if an offer is for a specific property this field contains the unique property code.</p>

<p>I thought that by using multiple JOIN's would be the solution, however when the any of the 3 main <code>offer</code> fields are empty the join returns 'NULL' for the <code>offers</code> table fields.</p>

I have configured this scroll view's pan gesture recognizer for two touches for both minimum and maximum number of touches requires.</p>

<p>Inside this scrollview I have one or more <code>UIScrollView</code> instances that only scrolls horizontally, these scrollviews each represent a single row in my jagged grid view. I have configured the pan gesture recognizers for all of these scroll views for one touch minimum, and two touches maximum.</p>

<p>So far it works, I get a nice jagged grid view where I can scroll vertically between rows, and horizontally to scroll each row independently. I have intentionally set to minimum number of touches as 2, as not to inter fear with scrolling if I add fro example a <code>UITableView</code> as a subview for any of cell within this jagged grid view (cell == a position defined by a row and column in that row).</p>

<p>Using a <code>UITableView</code> as a cell works, the table view works as expected that is. But scrolling with two fingers also scrolls inside the table view, not at the root scroll view for vertically scrolling between rows.</p>

<p>I have tried configuring the table views pan gesture recognizer to allow a maximum of one touches, in hope that two finger touches would be ignored. This does not work, the <code>maximumNumberOfTouches</code> property of the table view's pan gesture recognizer seams to be ignored.</p>

<p>What could I have done wrong?</p>

So I added my .dll file as an embedded resource and also added it as a reference. Then in Program.cs (I have no idea where the code he posted is supposed to go), I added this:</p>

<pre><code>    ...
    [STAThread]
    static void Main()
    {
            Application.EnableVisualStyles();
            Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
            string[] args = Environment.GetCommandLineArgs();
            if (args.Length &gt; 1)
                _in = args[1];
            SingleInstanceController controller = new SingleInstanceController();
            controller.Run(args);

            AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve += (sender, argsx) =&gt;
{
String resourceName = ""AssemblyLoadingAndReflection."" +
   new AssemblyName(argsx.Name).Name + "".dll"";
using (var stream = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream(resourceName))
{
    Byte[] assemblyData = new Byte[stream.Length];
    stream.Read(assemblyData, 0, assemblyData.Length);
    return Assembly.Load(assemblyData);
    }
}
        ;
</code></pre>

<p>Am I supposed to change resourceName to something else? Have I added it correctly (in the right place)?</p>

<p>Now the problem is, it still fails to find and load the assembly and I'm not sure what I've done wrong. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>The structure of my app is that I have a root view controller that doesn't really have a view of its own, rather it has a tab view controller and loads other view controllers into it.  But in the future, it may have to load other view controllers instead of the tab bar controller depending on app logic.</p>

<p>My main question is, what do people usually put into the viewDidLoad, .... methods.</p>

<p>Currently I:</p>

<p>viewDidLoad - setup the tab bar controller and set its view to the view controller's own view</p>

<p>viewDidAppear - check if user has stored login info
                   if not - present with login
                   if so, login and get app data for first tab</p>

<p>I'm trying to figure out now if my logic for setting up my tab bar controller should go into  loadView rather than viewDidLoad.</p>

<p>Any help would be great.  Small examples found on the web are great, but they don't go into detail on how larger apps should be structured.</p>

<p>The polling works if it polls every second but I want to poll every millisecond and the only way I think I can do it is the call the pollkey from the dely subroutine but if I do that it's like nothing happens. Can you help me? I asked how to do it before and got an answer in C only while I think that the answer should be to change the assembly. </p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I'm getting much better results using <code>br</code> instead of <code>call</code> so I must check the difference. This is what I'm using that works better:</p>

<pre><code>        .equ    delaycount,     16911 #set right delay value here!
        .text                   # Instructions follow
        .global delay           # Makes ""delay"" globally known

delay:  beq     r4,r0,fin       # exit outer loop
        movi    r8,delaycount   # delay estimation for 1ms

inner:  beq     r8,r0,outer     # exit from inner loop
        subi    r8,r8,1         # decrement inner counter
        br      inner

outer:  subi    r4,r4,1         # decrement outer counter

"3355697","1","","","2010-07-28 17:36:55","","3","974","<p>I’m working on tuning performance on a high-performance, high-capacity data engine which ultimately services an end-user web experience.  Specifically, the piece delegated to me revolves around characterizing multi-threaded file IO and memory mapping of the data to local cache.  In writing test applications to isolate the timing tall-poles, several questions have been exposed.  The code has been minimized to perform only a system file open (<code>open(O_RDONLY)</code>) call.  I’m hoping that the result of this query helps us understand the fundamental low-level system processes so that a complete predictive (or at least relational)  timing model can be understood.  Suggestions are always welcome.  We’ve seemed to hit a timing barrier, and would like to understand the behavior and determine whether that barrier can be broken.</p>

<p>The test program:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is written in C, compiled using the gnu C compiler as noted below;</li>
<li>Is minimally written to isolate the discovered issues to a single system file “open()”;</li>
<li>Is configurable to simultaneously launch a requested number of pthreads;</li>
<li>loads a list of 1000 text files of ~8K size;</li>
<li>creates the threads (simply) with no attribute modifications;</li>
<li>each thread performs multiple, sequential file open() calls on the next available file from the pre-determined list of files until the file list is exhausted in such a way that a single thread should open all 1000 files, 2 threads should theoretically open 500 files (not proven as of yet), etc.);</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ve run tests multiple times, parametrically varying the thread count, file sizes, and whether the files are located on a local or remote server.  Several questions have come up.</p>

<p>Observed results (opening remote files):</p>

<ol>
<li>File open times are higher the first time through (as expected, due to file caching);</li>
<li>Running the test app with one thread to load all the remote files takes X seconds;</li>
<li>It appears that running the app with a thread count between 1 and # of available CPUs on the machine results in times that are proportional to the number of CPUs (nX seconds).</li>
<li>Running the app using a thread count > #CPUs results in run times that seem to level out at the approx same value as the time is takes to run with #CPUs threads (is this coincidental, or a systematic limit, or what?).</li>
<li>Running multiple, concurrent processes (for example, 25 concurrent instances of the same test app) results in the times being approximately linear with number of processes for a selected thread count.</li>
<li>Running app on different servers shows similar results</li>
</ol>

<p>Observed results (opening files residing locally):</p>

<ol>
<li>Orders of magnitude faster times (as to be expected);</li>
<li>With increasing the thread count, a LOW timing inflection point occurs at around 4-5 active threads, then increases again until the number of threads equals the CPU count, then levels off again;</li>
<li>Running multiple, concurrent processes (same test) results in the times being approximately linear with number of processes for a constant thread count (same result as #5 above).</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, we noticed that Local opens take about .01 ms and sequential network opens are 100x slower at 1ms.  Opening network files, we get a linear throughput increase up to 8x with 8 threads, but 9+ threads do nothing.   The network open calls seem to block after more than 8 simultaneous requests.  What we expected was an initial delay equal to the network roundtrip, and then approximately the same throughput as local.   Perhaps there is extra mutex locking done on the local and remote systems that takes 100x longer.   Perhaps there is some internal queue of remote calls that only holds 8. </p>

<p>Expected results and questions to be answered either by test or by answers from forums like this one:</p>

<ol>
<li>Running multiple threads would result in the same work done in shorter time;</li>
<li>Is there an optimal number of threads;</li>
<li>Is there a relationship between the number of threads and CPUs available? </li>
<li>Is there some other systematic reason that an 8-10 file limit is observed?</li>
<li>How does the system call to “open()” work in a multi-threading process?</li>
<li>Each thread gets its context-switched time-slice;</li>
<li>Does the open() call block and wait until the file is open/loaded into file cache?  Or does the call allow context switching to occur while the operation is in progress?</li>
<li>When the open() completes, does the scheduler reprioritize that thread to execute sooner, or does the thread have to wait until its turn in round-robin way;</li>
<li>Would having the mounted volume on which the 1000 files reside set as read-only or read/write make a difference?</li>
<li>When open() is called with a full path, is each element in the path stat()ed?  Would it make more sense to open() a common directory in the list of files tree, and then open() the files under that common directory by relative path?</li>
</ol>

Just imaging there are tens of variables instead of just <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>. The problem is that I need to define domain for each variable separately. I don't like it because it makes my program much longer and less transparent.</p>

<p>Input:</p>

<pre><code>?- Dom1 in 0..2, Dom2 in 0..2, global_cardinality([X,Y], [0-Dom1,1-Dom2]), labeling([],[X,Y]).
</code></pre>

<p>Results:</p>

<pre><code>X = 0,
Y = 0,
Dom1 = 2,
Dom2 = 0 ? ;
X = 0,
Y = 1,
Dom1 = 1,
Dom2 = 1 ? ;
X = 1,
Y = 0,
Dom1 = 1,
Dom2 = 1 ? ;
X = 1,
Y = 1,
Dom1 = 0,
Dom2 = 2 ? ;
no
</code></pre>

<p>At first I thought that I would solve it simply by writing:</p>

<pre><code>?- Dom1 in 0..2, global_cardinality([X,Y], [0-Dom1,1-Dom1]), labeling([],[X,Y]).  
</code></pre>

<p>but it does not work because Dom1 unifies (is this the proper term for what happens in clpfd?) with one value and therefore the only results are:</p>

<pre><code>X = 0,      
Y = 1,
Dom1 = 1 ? ;
X = 1,
Y = 0,
Dom1 = 1 ? ;
no

<p>MSDN gives the following as an example of a loop that can be vectorized:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i=0; i&lt;1000; ++i)
{       
    A[i] = A[i] + 1;

<p>Here is my version of a range-based analogue to the above, a c-style monstrosity, and a similar loop using <code>std::for_each</code>. I compiled with the <strong>/Qvec-report:2</strong> flag and added the compiler messages as comments:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;

int main()
{
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec(1000, 1);

    // simple range-based for loop
    {
        for (int&amp; elem : vec)
        {
            elem = elem + 1;
        }
    } // info C5002 : loop not vectorized due to reason '1304'

    // c-style iteration
    {
        int * begin = vec.data();
        int * end = begin + vec.size();

        for (int* it = begin; it != end; ++it)
        {
            *it = *it + 1;
        }
    } // info C5001: loop vectorized

    // for_each iteration
    {
        std::for_each(vec.begin(), vec.end(), [](int&amp; elem)
        {
            elem = elem + 1;
        });
    } // (no compiler message provided)

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Only the c-style loop gets vectorized. Reason 1304 is as follows as per <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/jj658585.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">the MSDN docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1304: Loop includes assignments that are of different sizes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It gives the following as an example of code that would trigger a 1304 message:</p>

<pre><code>void code_1304(int *A, short *B)
{
    // Code 1304 is emitted when the compiler detects
    // different sized statements in the loop body.
    // In this case, there is an 32-bit statement and a
    // 16-bit statement.

    // In cases like this consider splitting the loop into loops to 
    // maximize vector register utilization.

    for (int i=0; i&lt;1000; ++i)
    {
        A[i] = A[i] + 1;
        B[i] = B[i] + 1;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm no expert but I can't see the relationship. Is this just buggy reporting? I've noticed that none of my range-based loops are getting vectorized in my actual program. What gives?</p>

<p>(In case this is buggy behavior I'm running VS2013 Professional Version 12.0.21005.1 REL)</p>

This means when searching for ""the cat"" I want documents containing this phrase to be shown, but not documents containing ""the"" and ""cat"" somewhere or in different fields.</p>

<p>What I have:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;fieldType name=""text"" class=""solr.TextField"" positionIncrementGap=""100""&gt;
        &lt;analyzer&gt;
            &lt;tokenizer class=""solr.StandardTokenizerFactory"" /&gt;

            &lt;filter class=""solr.CommonGramsFilterFactory"" words=""lang/stopwords.txt"" format=""snowball"" /&gt;
            &lt;filter class=""solr.StopFilterFactory"" words=""lang/stopwords.txt"" format=""snowball"" enablePositionIncrements=""true"" /&gt;
        &lt;/analyzer&gt;
    &lt;/fieldType&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This should output special gram tokens when a ""normal"" word is combined with a stopword from stopwords.txt. In analyze view this works as expected, so ""the cat"" gets common-grammed to ""the_cat cat"".</p>

<p>The solution my client is after is that when stop words in the query are used in conjunction with normal words, only elements with this exact phrase (stop-word-2-shingle) should match. The overall default operator is still AND.</p>

<p>For example, I have documents with the following fields</p>

<ol>
<li>id: 1; title: my cat in its natuarl surroundings; desc: the nicest animal in da world is a cat</li>
<li>id: 2; title: the cat is evil; desc: everyone knows that cats are pure evil</li>
<li>id: 3; title: cat solving mysteries; desc: our cat is called Sherlock</li>
</ol>

<p>The following are examples of what I'd like to achieve... bascially the users are more or less illiterate with respect to searches and queries and operators, thus the search should interpret the input and ""do the right thing"". The right thing would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>input: cat<br>
result: docs 1, 2, 3 (w/o scoring for the sake of easiness)</li>
<li>input: cat world<br>
result: doc 1<br>
AND is default</li>
<li>input: cat everyone<br>
result: doc 2<br>
AND spanning multiple fields</li>
<li>input: the cat<br>
result: doc 1
because only this field contains the phrase ""the cat"", that somehow has to magically appera during query</li>
<li>input: the nice cat<br>
reult: []<br>
because no document contains the phrase ""the nice"" and the algorithm would interpret this as a common word phrase</li>
<li>input: the cat world<br>
result: doc 1  </li>
<li>input: the pure
result: []</li>
</ol>

<p>The reasoning behind this is that the client has some specific ideas regarding some (carefully selected) stop words.<br>
So is this a realistic way of doing it? Is it necessary to do some kind of query pre-parsing before passing it to solr? Are there other ways to achieve the desired results?</p>

I want to call this library from Python, and in order to do so I need to pass a struct by reference so that the library can modify it. The structure is defined:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct eventNode eventNode;
struct eventNode{
    int channels;
    int samples;
    uint16_t** event;
    eventNode* next;
    eventNode* prev;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and in Python I have defined:</p>

<pre><code>class eventNode(Structure):
    pass

eventNode._fields_ = [(""channels"", c_int),
            (""samples"", c_int),
            (""event"",POINTER(POINTER(c_uint16))),
            (""prev"",POINTER(eventNode)),
            (""next"",POINTER(eventNode))]
</code></pre>

<p>which I believe is correct. Essentially I used this to implement a linked list, which my library can modify by calling a method with signature <code>void getFromCAEN(int, char*, eventNode**, eventNode**)</code>. The last two arguments are pointers to pointers to the list head and tail, respectively. My python code creates these pointers by calling:</p>

<pre><code>queueHead = POINTER(eventNode)()
queueTail = POINTER(eventNODE)()
</code></pre>

<p>which should initially be NULL (None in ctypes) so that the library knows the list is empty. When I call this function with the line</p>

<pre><code>caenlib.getFromCAEN(handle,buff,byref(queueHead),byref(queueTail))
</code></pre>

<p>a linked list should be formed by the library, which I then attempt to index through with the following block:</p>

<pre><code>cur = queueHead
while cur:
    i+=1
    print(""event!"",i)
    print(addressof(cur))
    print(cur.contents.channels,cur.contents.samples)
    print(cur.contents.event)
    print(cur.contents.next) #print next object in line
    cur = cur.contents.next
    print(cur)               #this prints a different address for some reason
</code></pre>

<p>And the output of all those print statements is this:</p>

<pre><code>event! 1
140486871191712
4 150
&lt;__main__.LP_LP_c_ushort object at 0x7fc5a60d9200&gt;
&lt;__main__.LP_eventNode object at 0x7fc5a60d9170&gt;
&lt;__main__.LP_eventNode object at 0x7fc5a60d9290&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But the problem is, that even though I know there should be many events in the list, it only iterates once and then stops. The problem seems to be with those last few lines, that even though <code>cur</code> gets assigned to <code>cur.contents.next</code>, the address seems to change 0x...170 becomes 0x...290 after the assignment. Attempting to dereference <code>cur</code> after this point raises a NULL poitner exception. I think I'm missing something about pointers and assignment in Python, but I'm not sure what to do.</p>

<p>PS the access to <code>cur.contents.channels</code> and <code>cur.contents.samples</code> returns exactly what I expect it to for the one object that I am able to access, indicating that it is working at least partially.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The script generally works well, but occasionally demonstrates this <em>problematic behavior</em>:</p>

<p>When running the script on a directory with lots of files and/or with files with long names, the script appears to iterate back over the collection of files (i.e. prepends to files that have already been prepended) and does so until the filenames become too long to be recognized by the FSO, crashing the script. </p>

<p>The threshold of the number of files/length of filenames at which this occurs appears to be very distinct and reproducible. For example, if I create a target directory (e.g. ""...\Desktop\Test"") with a file named '1.doc' that is copied/pasted several times, the script will properly rename up to 31 files, but it demonstrates the problematic behavior with 32+ files. Similarly, if I run the script twice over 31 files (generated in the same manner), the script demonstrates the problematic behavior on the second run. </p>

<p>This code works unless a picture is loaded from the server when the page loads. In the event that <code>pictureUrl</code> is set, the picture renders fine. I can ""delete"" it. However, if I try to add a new picture, the new thumbnail does not appear. The size of the file does. But the thumbnail does not show.</p>

Unfortunately it doesn't have the desired effect. While the classes do get loaded, I can't use them outside the function where I loaded them.

For eg: 
1) This returns as to what kind of store is present in one or more cities?</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT store_type FROM stores
WHERE EXISTS 
             (SELECT *

<p>So how can the same sub query give output for both the queries? as one uses EXIST and the other uses NOT EXIST?</p>

<p>It works fine in the dev env. But when I'm deploying my app using webstart, then in the client side, it returns null.It is because of the fact that my app is running on JRE instead of JDK. [System.getProperty(""java.home"") points to JRE]</p>

<p>To overcome this issue, I had followed the suggestion mentioned in the following SO thread.</p>

<p>Now <code>ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler();</code>returns valid compiler object, but I'm getting the following exception while compiling the java code with it. It is actually while calling the getStandardFileManager method of the compiler object.</p>

This is whereby you can specify the weight of a specific term during a query, and is not related to the weighting of a particular field.</p>

<p>The HTML query generated by sunspot uses the qf parameter to specify the fields to be searched as configured, and the q parameter for the query itself. When the caret is added to a search term to specify a boost (i.e. q=searchterm^5) it returns no results, even though results would be returned without the boost term.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, I create an HTTP query manually and manually specify the field to search (q=title_texts:searchterm^5), results are returned and scores seem affected by the boost.</p>

<p>In short, it appears as though query term boosting doesn't work in conjunction with fields specified with qf.</p>

<p>My application calls for search across several fields, using the respective boosts associated to those fields, conditionally in turn with boosting on individual terms of a query.</p>

<p>Any insight?</p>

  <p>x is lazily evaluated the first time that you call one of the adder functions. At this point, the loop is complete and the
  final value of x is 10. Therefore all of the adder functions will add
  10 on to their input, probably not what you wanted!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I check and it is indeed true that <code>x</code> within each <code>adders[[num]]</code> evaluates to <code>10</code>.</p>

<pre><code>get(""x"", envir=environment(adders[[2]])) # = 10
get(""x"", envir=environment(adders[[9]])) # = 10
</code></pre>

<p>But why? For example, when <code>adders[[2]]</code> is defined as the returned value of <code>add(2)</code>, at that moment <code>x = 2</code>. According to Hadley, ""a function preserves the environment in which it was defined."" So why didn't <code>adders[[2]]</code> preserve the environment in which <code>x = 2</code>? </p>

I should also state that the this class is one of several that helps display the GUI. Every class is responsible for one operation requested by the user. They are all collected in a class called Mainpage which is used in the class System which runs the whole program. The first thing done in System is the creation of a Database object, and the connection to the database. This Database object is then what is then used as a parameter in every GUI class.</p>

I wanted to do this directly with <code>sys_read</code> and not <code>scanf</code> so I could manually convert the input to an integer after removing the <code>LF</code>.</p>

<p>Here's the full source: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/utnjTvNZ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/utnjTvNZ</a></p>

<p>In particular, what I want to do now is manually add a newline to the result of the multiplication that is now converted back to it's ASCII char equivalent. Initially, I thought I could just left shift 16 bits and add <code>0xA</code> leaving me with, for example, <code>0x0034000A</code> on the stack for <code>2*2 (0x0034 is ""4"" in ASCII chars)</code>, followed by a null terminator and a <code>LF</code>. However, the <code>LF</code> is printing before the result. I figured this was an endianess thing, so I tried the reverse <code>(0x000A0034)</code> and that just printed some other ASCII char instead.</p>

<p>So, simply, how do I properly push a newline to the stack so that this is printed with a newline following the number when using <code>sys_write</code>? What I'm missing is how strings are stored on the stack... which I can't test because normally you just create a variable and push the address onto the stack.</p>

<p>I'm aware some things in here could be done better, cleaner and up-to-standards and whatnot. I understand things intuitively so it's something I just need to do to better understand the stack and Linux system calls in general.</p>

What I don't understand is what happen when using ""self."" and without ""self."" regarding retain count. I actually ran retainCount method on myImageView object and it confirms my original, the ""self."" case has a retain count of two off the bat (with alloc and property retain so it's probably a good idea to use autorelease there). Now this lead to another question, if I were not to use autorelease, how do I go about this? release once in viewDidLoad and once more in dealloc would still result in a memory leak, right?</p>

<p>IMHO the async style requires 3 times as much code, and looks like goto spaghetti - its difficult to read, and forces you to separate out related code. So why would you use the async way? Presumably it must have some advantage?</p>

<p>I've tried changing my target MonoAndroid version to either the latest or the earliest and it didn't seem to change anything, so I've put it back to where it was originally.</p>

<p>This is the error I'm getting. The problem is I either need to get this to work (because Xamarin didn't update their website so I can't download it from there and just take their .dll) OR do the bindings for Google Play Services myself which would probably be a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>Unless there is another way?

<p>Below is my Jquery dialog code,</p>

<pre><code>    dlg.dialog({
        height:300,
        width:600,
        modal:true,
        autoOpen:true,
        title: ""Add Property"",
        closeOnEscape:true,
        buttons: {
            ""Cancel"": function() {
                $(this).dialog(""close"");
            },
            ""Create Property"": function() {
                    //Validate Property 
                    // Save Property 
                    $(this).dialog(""close"");
                }
            }
        }
     }); 

    function save() {
       $.ajax({
        type: 'POST',
        url: ServiceUrl,
        data: parameter,
        success : function(data) {

            // Convert the response text to JSON format
            var jsonData = eval('(' + data + ')');

            if (jsonData.results) {
                   // success
            } 
         }
      });
    };
</code></pre>

<p>In above code I am executing $(this).dialog(""close""); after validate and save function but my dialog is getting closed , before these function finishes. This behavior doesn't happen if I execute line by line by keeping breakpoints in firebug. Please help in resolving and help me in understanding. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>To just give a sample, and when I upload my CSV file to add the values, I print them out in the console and see that the values are being read correctly and they are. But, once my php script ends and I return to the main page, my dates are all null. None of them are the values what are reflected in the csv file. Here is the schema for my database:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `affiliationagreements` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `AANumber` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
  `Facility` varchar(150) DEFAULT NULL,
  `Submitor` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `Program` varchar(60) DEFAULT NULL,
  `Location` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `College` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `SubmissionDate` date DEFAULT NULL,
  `Action` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `EffectiveDate` date DEFAULT NULL,
  `Status` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `ExpirationDate` date DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
</code></pre>

<p>If I change SubmissionDate, EffectiveDate, and ExpirationDate to a varchar, they insert correctly but I can't use varchar because I am comparing date values. And Advice?</p>

<p>***Update. In the CSV file, the format is MM/DD/YYYY. I didn't think this would be a problem. Would it be better to change this? And I'm deleting records because my boss wanted the DB cleared before a file was reuploaded since the uploaded file was an update of the previously uploaded one. ****</p>

<p>It's basically wrapper around <em>HibernateTemplate</em>. All my other DAOs inherit this class and implement appropriate interfaces, which hold some additional methods (like getBySomeAttribute()). So basically these DAOs have <strong>only</strong> methods. Further more, I have <em>service</em> layer that wraps DAOs. That is, a service class can hold multiple DAOs, and method calls from service layer are intercepted with spring-AOP for auto commit/rollback (transaction demaracation). For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class ModelDAO extends BaseDAO&lt;Model&gt; implements IModelDAO
{
    @Override
    public Model getNew() {
        return new Model();
    }

    @Override
    public List&lt;Model&gt; getBySomeAttr() {
        DetachedCriteria criteria;
        // define some criteria
        return getHibernateTemplate().findByCriteria(criteria);
    }
}

...

public class ModelService
{
    private ModelDAO modelDAO;
    private ElementDAO elementDAO;
    // GET/SET for model and user DAO

    public void doSomethingWithModel() {

        modelDAO.doSomething();
        elementDAO.doSomethingElse();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Config is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""hibernateTemplate2"" class=""org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.HibernateTemplate""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""sessionFactory"" ref=""sessionFactory2"" /&gt;
    &lt;property name=""maxResults"" value=""3000"" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;!-- DAO --&gt;
&lt;bean id=""baseDAO"" abstract=""true"" 
    class=""org.irvas.backend.dao_implement.BaseDAO"" scope=""session""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""hibernateTemplate"" ref=""hibernateTemplate2"" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
&lt;bean id=""modelDAO"" 
    class=""org.irvas.backend.dao_implement.ModelDAOImplement"" 
    parent=""baseDAO"" scope=""session""&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
&lt;bean id=""elementDAO"" 
    class=""org.irvas.backend.dao_implement.ElementDAOImplement"" 
    parent=""baseDAO"" scope=""session""&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;!-- Service --&gt;
&lt;bean id=""modelService"" 
    class=""org.irvas.backend.service_implement.ModelServiceImplement"" scope=""session""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""modelDAO"" ref=""modelDAO"" /&gt;
    &lt;property name=""elementDAO"" ref=""elementDAO"" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

    &lt;property name=""elementDAO"" ref=""elementDAO"" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm wondering how should I scope DAO/Service beans for multi-user purposes? I am injecting service beans into <strong>prototype</strong> controllesrs for GUI.
When I use this configuration (with scope=""session""), I get error like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error creating bean with name 'modelService': java.lang.IllegalArgumentException setAttribute: Non-serializable attribute: modelDAO</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd say that this is thrown from Tomcat's StandardSession.setAttribute(). From this I could conclude that my DAOs should implement Serializable, and what confuses me even more is that I saw exact same code that works without implementing Serializable...  </p>

<p>If someone could enlighten me what is going on here, and <strong>how</strong> to scope DAOs and Services for this particular case, I'd be very grateful...</p>

<li>I created an ontology of airplanes,

<li>Now that the ontology is getting a bit complicated, I ran into a problem</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What I want:</strong></p>

<p>Since I am learning, I thought it would be great to try to have a property hasCity both for the country and the airport. This should result in linking the aiport with the city and also the city with a country only having one property.</p>

<p><strong>What I tried (and failed to understand)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I modified <strong>the hasCity property to be in the domain Airport</strong></li>
<li>Another modification I did was that <strong>the property hasCity is also a functionalInverseOf hasAirport</strong></li>

<p>The problem I am having is that the results calculated do not match the results calculated by the NOAA Solar calculator <a href=""http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/azel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/azel.html</a></p>

<p>For example. Using the PySol </p>

and I have lots and lots of <code>graphics(g)</code> drawings/objects drawn through their own class.</p>

<p>What I want to get is the <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> coordinate out of one of them.</p>

<p><code>public static int</code> seems too hard to use in this case, without created an equal number of integers as there are drawings. </p>

<p>So, I need something to use instead of <code>getY()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e){
    int key = e.getKeyCode();
    if (key == KeyEvent.VK_LEFT) {
        for (int i=0; i&lt;=42; i++) {

            this.cx += -10;
            repaint();


    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Information you might need to know in this code:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>rektangel(the name)</code> = rectangle in english.</li>
<li><code>cirkel</code> is one object/drawing ==> I simply used a <code>static int</code> <code>cx</code> &amp; <code>cy</code> for this guy to see it's coordinates.</li>
<li>Where it says <code>i&lt;42;</code> ==> shows that it's ALOT of drawn objects. (<code>static int</code> won't be optimal)</li>
</ul>

<p>=============ANSWERED======ANSWERED=======ANSWERED=======ANSWERED==========
Sorry, but for some reason I can't comment your answers. The result is ridiculously laughable. I'm currently staying up late to finish my code for a homework I have. Thanks for your solution, and MadProgrammers comment. Here's my rectangle-class:</p>

<pre><code>public class Rektangel {
   private int width,height;
   private int x,y; &lt;---this row private
   Color c;
   public static int karta = 1;
   public static int rx = 0;
   public static int ry = 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The easiest thing in the world.. I had tried using <code>rectangle[i].x</code> in the previous code, but didn't work. Know why? Because I wrote private instead of public x &amp; y. Sorry for the inconvenience and once again, Thanks!</p>

<p>How do you apply a tranformation matrix to geometry and maintain the normals?</p>

<p>Currently I'm using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>        GL.PushMatrix();

        if (Offset != null)
        {
            GL.Translate(Offset.X, Offset.Y, Offset.Z);
        }
        GL.Begin(BeginMode.Triangles);
        foreach (var face in Faces)
        {
            foreach (var i in face)
            {
                var point = Points[i - 1];
                GL.Normal3(point);
                GL.Vertex3(point);
            }
        }
        GL.End();
        GL.PopMatrix();
</code></pre>

<p>When I give the geometry an offset, it doesn't render properly (e.g. the normals don't map correctly.</p>

<p>Any help would be excellent.</p>

<p>p.s., I'm using the OpenTK wrapper, but regular OpenGL translates directly across.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Ok, if I change the above code to the following: </p>

<pre><code>        GL.PushMatrix();

        //if (Offset != null)
        //{
        //    GL.Translate(Offset.X, Offset.Y, Offset.Z);
        //}
        GL.Begin(BeginMode.Triangles);
        foreach (var face in Faces)
        {
            foreach (var i in face)
            {
                var point = Points[i - 1];
                if (Offset == null)
                {
                    GL.Normal3(point);
                    GL.Vertex3(point);
                }
                else
                {
                    var pt = new Vector3d(Offset.X + point.X, Offset.Y + point.Y, Offset.Z + point.Z);
                    GL.Normal3(pt);
                    GL.Vertex3(pt);
                }
            }
        }
        GL.End();
        GL.PopMatrix();

My first question is, when I remove ""implements Serializable"" from any of my classes, a NotSerializableException is NOT thrown. Why not? They are all extending Serializable classes, but shouldn't they themselves have to be Serializable as well?</p>

<p>Another problem I have, which may be related, is that when I read the object back in, I get a java.io.EOFException.  </p>

<p>I don't understand why any of these two things are happening. I use the same exact file name for both reading and writing. Why is it hitting the end of the file before it's done?</p>

<p>Here's the writing code:   </p>

<pre><code>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event)
            {
                try
                {
                    saver.writeObject(game);
                    saver.close();

                }

                dispose();
            }
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the reading code:   </p>

<pre><code>File file = new File(""savedgame.dat"");
    if (file.exists())
    {
        try
        {
            loader = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(file));
            game = (GameBoard) loader.readObject();
            loader.close();
        }
        catch (EOFException ex)
        {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    else
    {
        game = new GameBoard();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The exception is being thrown on the <code>game = (GameBoard) loader.readObject();</code> line.</p>

<p>Here's the stack trace: </p>

<p>Take not of the bolded lines. I would expect the parent process to wait at the wait() command and the child would print out ""Child done sleeping..."" and then finish and then the parent would print out ""Parent: running...""</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong!</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Update: full output to program is:</p>

<pre><code>dmegs
more
Child: My PID = 30070
Child: Running...
Parent: My PID = 30066
Parent: Running...
parent starting command: more
child starting command: dmegs
Child: Done sleeping, returning.
all done

<p>However, using the unmarshal delegation as follows:</p>

<pre><code>implicit val WhateverUnmarshaller =

<p>I have no idea where that <code>None(...)</code> is coming from. None.</p>

<p>The Spray internals are rather complicated and hours into it I still can't figure out why this is happening. Of course, before this it has marked the response as a failure since it's not valid JSON. </p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p><code>List/Combinations</code> contains combinations of <code>(airline, timings, stops)</code>, these are of the form:</p>

<p><code>[airline, timings, stops], [airline, timings], [timings, stops], [stops], [airline], etc..</code></p>

<p><code>findall</code> is being used to collect the successful options.</p>

<p><code>ListItems</code> contains nested list of the form <code>[FlightNo, X, Y, Z]</code>.</p>

<p><code>satisfy_*</code> predicates work fine and return true or false based on the arguments.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
In the code above, the problem I am having is that i want to execute the respective <code>satisfy_*</code> predicate only if it is in the <code>Start</code> which is verified by <code>member/2</code> variable.</p>

<p>So if <code>Start</code> contains <code>[airline, stops]</code>, then only <code>satisfy_airline</code> and <code>satisfy_stops</code> must execute.</p>

It is coming from the following method when I call the fill method. I'm running the below method around 10,000 times and it is accessing my local database on the same machine. It doesn't seem to be freeing up the thread pool in the database or so I think from my extremely narrow knowledge about sql server issues. I believe the issue might be with how I have written the linq queries that I'm using to search for data in the database. What exactly am I doing wrong and how do I go about fixing this issue?</p>

<p>These settings are pulled fine from web.config for sending emails from code by just declaring a SMTP client and using it to send emails,</p>

<p>But when I add the  section to the service definition the setting are not used and I get a SMTP host was not specified every time an email is attempted. The new SmtpClient() has none of the settings from config. I can not figure out how to fix this nor can I find any info elsewhere.</p>

<p>I am downloading and displaying large pictures (620x620 jpg) in a full width list. They are slow the first time it is downloaded/displayed. This problem is not anymore occuring after an upgrade to android 4.2. on HTC one.</p>

<p>I tried to profile the calls and I believe that during the very long calls, it hangs reading the socket inputstream. </p>

<p>Has anyone a clue as to why there is such a difference in performance between the two platforms? </p>

The sheer number of images makes me want to store the JPEG data in memory and decode them when I want to display them. To ease on the Garbage Collector, I'm using <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/BitmapFactory.Options.html#inBitmap"">BitmapFactory.Options.inBitmap</a> to reuse bitmaps.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this causes rather severe tearing, I've tried different solutions such as synchronization, semaphores, alternating between 2-3 bitmaps, however, none seem to fix the problem.</p>

<p>I've set up an example project which demonstrates this issue over at GitHub; <a href=""https://github.com/Berglund/android-tearing-example"">https://github.com/Berglund/android-tearing-example</a></p>

<p>I've got a thread which decodes the bitmap, sets it on the UI thread, and sleeps for 5 ms:</p>

<pre><code>Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
@Override
public void run() {
        while(true) {
            BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
            options.inSampleSize = 1;

            if(bitmap != null) {
                options.inBitmap = bitmap;
            }

            bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(), images.get(position), options);

            runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    imageView.setImageBitmap(bitmap);
                }
            });

            try {
                Thread.sleep(5);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {}

            position++;
            if(position &gt;= images.size())
                position = 0;
        }
    }
};
Thread t = new Thread(runnable);
t.start();
</code></pre>

<p>My idea is that ImageView.setImageBitmap(Bitmap) draws the bitmap on the next vsync, however, we're probably already decoding the next bitmap when this happens, and as such, we've started modifying the bitmap pixels. Am I thinking in the right direction?</p>

<p>Has anyone got any tips on where to go from here?</p>

<p>I've managed to rotate the SVG simply enough to face the correct direction - however the trouble I'm having is getting the  element to absolutely position by the tick/tip of the pink circle, depending on where its rotated to.</p>

<p>The logic in my head that I was following was something along the lines of:
Get the circle center point
Get the rotation
Find out what the left &amp; top position would be based off the above.</p>

<p>However I'm completely lost on what the calculation would be to get the top and left coordinates to be able to absolutely position the mark where it should be.</p>

This is so I can run my startup routine as if I start it traditionally (drop it in startup folder) then my programs often do not load correctly. An example of this would be when Skype is launched, the tray icon is often missing. Another is when I try to <code>subst</code> a drive (using a batch file) it often just doesn't. As a side note, when I log off, then back on, it works fine and everything loads normally, but this is inconvenient.</p>

<p>My active desktop is just a HTML file that loads a looping swf, so there is little lag (compared to gifs) and little CPU usage. Also, FRAPS (running from a service) gives a DirectX 9 warning when the system is booting, before the desktop has loaded.</p>

<p>I have tried several snippets of code to check if explorer.exe has launched, but this is does not help as it continues as normal. I have also tried using <code>time.sleep</code> but this is not satisfactory as it is hard to guess the right delay.</p>

<p>-- EDIT --</p>

<p>I have found a roundabout way of fixing this for the meantime. This method is both more and less intensive on CPU. This is because it checks to see if the active window is the desktop, then changes the wallpaper. Otherwise, it 'sleeps' for 3 seconds. For this method to work, I had to extract every layer from my .gif as a .bmp and number them. My full code is as follows: </p>

<pre><code>import ctypes
import os.path
import time
from win32gui import GetWindowText, GetForegroundWindow

## get current directory and add the working path to the end
cd = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)) + '\\wallpaperslides\\'
## find the number of files in this directory
nfiles = len(os.walk(cd).next()[2])

## initialise variables
invalidfiles = 0
fnum = 1

## check to see if every file is numbered and a .bmp
for x in range(nfiles):
    fname = cd + str(x+1) + '.bmp'
    if os.path.isfile(fname) != True:
        ## makes sure all of the files are there, otherwise...
        print fname + ' doesn\'t exist'
        invalidfiles = 1

## ...tell the user to fix
if invalidfiles == 1:
    print 'All files should be numbered and in bitmap format'
    print ''
    raw_input('Press enter to exit\n')
    raise SystemExit

elif invalidfiles == 0:
    ## Main loop
    while True:
        ## Find active window, if it is the desktop...
        if GetWindowText(GetForegroundWindow()) == '' or GetWindowText(GetForegroundWindow()) == 'Program Manager':
            ## Set wallpaper

As I said it happens more or less randomly, so I can't tell which instruction, function or module is the problem in it. It has been happening since people first started testing it (Code was only a few hundred lines back then), so it take it's a very basic combination of clear and write/input instructions.</p>

<p>Any cluse about what could be causing this will be appreciated.</p>

Say, a textarea with a class of <code>with-counter</code> that updates the number of characters being typed on it; a list that listens when a <code>mouseover</code> happens; a link that is being ajaxified; and so on.</p>

<p>e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>$(""textarea.with-counter"").keydown(function(){
   var text_len = $(this).val().length;
   //manipulate the span/etc that has the counter
});
$(""a.ajax_link"").click(function(){
   var loc = $(this).attr(""href"");
   //load the value of href via $.ajax to some div
   //yadda yadda
});
</code></pre>

<p>The initial scenario is this: A relatively small amount of HTML is loaded from the database and then actions are being attached to it (implementing the code snippet above). Now, I have this script that loads another chunk of same format HTML. The newly loaded HTML should receive the same actions. </p>

<p>The bottom line of the problem is: I don't want to attach these actions to the objects/elements that I have attached these actions before. As newer chunk of HTMLs are loaded, the slower this attaching of actions happen. The actions are being attached to the previously loaded HTML (remember that they have these actions) when what I want to happen is that the actions must be attached <strong>only</strong> to the newly loaded HTML chunks. There are times that FF freezes and will ask if I want to continue the script process.</p>

<p>Ergo, the question: Is there a way where I can opt to bypass attaching of actions to the elements that I have attached actions before?</p>

Anyone who uses the theme would be able input variables in one place (ie: disqus shortname, google analytics UA code, etc.). I have everything finished up but for some reason it doesn't seem to be loading the config file. Here's what I have:</p>

<p>I have this in a file called ""ichi-config.js"" in the theme-name/assets/js folder :</p>

<pre><code>// If you use DisQus comments, add your disqus shortname here
var config_disqus_shortname = 'barneycarney';
</code></pre>

<p>This is the javascript I have in a filed called ""disqus.js"" in the theme-name/assets/js folder which loads the comment section if they have input a shortname in the config file:</p>

<pre><code>var disqus_loaded = false;

function load_disqus() {
    if (config_disqus_shortname !== '') {
        disqus_loaded = true;
        var disqus_shortname = config_disqus_shortname;
        var disqus_identifier = '{{post.id}}'; // make sure to use the post.id as an identifier, otherwise disqus will use the pages url per default, which might be problematic...

        // For embedding disqus under a post
        (function() {
            var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;
            dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';
            (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);
        })();
    }
}

load_disqus();
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the ""post.hbs"" file in the theme root folder I have:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""disqus_thread""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=""{{asset ""js/disqus.js""}}""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the head portion of the ""default.hbs"" file, which is basically the template for all blog pages, I try to load the ""ichi-config.js"" script:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""{{asset ""js/ichi-config.js""}}""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p>I'm currently working on an existing MVC website, adding Admin features to it as needed.  There is one main Admin View.  All other CRUD operations are handled by Partial Views loaded into the one single Admin View.  To this point, I've had no issues adding all of these partial views.  Right now, there are two tables: Email_Queue and Smtp_Server.  The business rules state that you must have a Smtp_Server record before you can create an Email_Queue record.</p>

<p>Therefore, to make it nicer for the user, I have a option to create a Smtp_Server within the Create partial view for the Email_Queue.  I can get the Create partial view for the Smtp_Server to open in a modal pop-up...I can get all of its validation (set in the Model) to trigger...I can get the cancel button to close the modal popup.  However, I cannot seem to get the submit button on the Smtp_Server partial view to post.</p>

<p>The end goal for all of this is eventually get that to post, and then have a dropdown in the Email_Queue partial view update with the new Smtp_server I just added.  For now, I'd be happy with the Smtp_Server just saving what I type in.</p>

<p>So, here's some code.  First, the Email_Queue partial view (I've removed extra fields to keep it shorter):</p>

<pre><code>@model Models.Email_QueueModel

&lt;div class=""main_column_leftfull""&gt;

        &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

            function CancelAddSmtpServer() {
                var windowElement = $('#QueueCreate');
                windowElement.hide();
            }

            $(document).ready(function() {

            var windowElement = $('#QueueCreate');
            var undoButton = $('#opener-popup');
            undoButton
                .bind('click', function(e) {
                    windowElement.data('tWindow').open();
                    undoButton.hide();})
                .toggle(!windowElement.is(':visible'));
                    windowElement.bind('close', function() {
                    undoButton.show();

                });
            });

            function CloseWindow() {
                var windowElement = $('#QueueCreate').data('tWindow');
                windowElement.close();

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>Next, the partial view I created for the modal popup:</p>

<pre><code>@model Models.Email_SmtpServerModel

&lt;div class=""main_column_leftfull""&gt;
&lt;!--=========Graph Box=========--&gt;
&lt;div class=""box expose""&gt;
    &lt;!-- A box with class of expose will call expose plugin automatically --&gt;
    &lt;div class=""header""&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""body""&gt;
        &lt;script src=""@Url.Content(""~/Scripts/jquery.validate.min.js"")"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src=""@Url.Content(""~/Scripts/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js"")"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


        @using (Ajax.BeginForm(""_QueueCreate"", new AjaxOptions() { UpdateTargetId = ""subForm"", HttpMethod = ""Post"" }))
        {
            &lt;fieldset&gt;
                @Form.HiddenID(""SMTPServerId"")
                &lt;div class=""editor-label""&gt;
                    @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.ServerName)
                    @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.ServerName, new { @class = ""textfield"" })
                    @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.ServerName)
                &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;div class=""editor-label""&gt;
                    @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.ServerDesc)
                    @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.ServerDesc, new { @class = ""textfield"" })
                    @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.ServerDesc)
                &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    @Form.Submit(value: ""Create SMTP Server"")

                    &lt;input id=""btnCancelEmail_SmtpServerQueueCreate"" type=""button"" value=""Cancel"" class=""button"" onclick=""CloseWindow();"" /&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/fieldset&gt;
        }
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>And finally, here's my controller code for _QueueCreate:</p>

<pre><code>[HttpPost]
    public virtual PartialViewResult _QueueCreate(Email_SmtpServerModel model, FormCollection fc)

            model.SMTPServerId = System.Guid.NewGuid();
            model.CreatedDateGMT = DateTime.Now;
            model.CreatedUserId = AppManager.GetUser(User.Identity.Name).UserId;

            if (dbESS.Insert(model, out errorMessage))
            {
                ModelState.AddModelError("""", errorMessage);
            }
            else
            {
                ViewBag.HasError = ""none"";
                return PartialView(""../Email_Queue/_Create"");
            }
        }
        catch
        {
            ViewBag.HasError = ""true"";
            return PartialView(""../Email_Queue/_Create"");
        }
        return PartialView(model);
    }

I've tried reading it in with &amp; without column headers, in .xls, .xlsx, . cdv, .txt (unicode and delimited) but without success. The file is called ""funds"", and the code I'm using is:</p>

<pre><code>NSData       *databuffer;
NSFileHandle * file;
NSString     *docDir  = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentationDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES)[0];
NSString     *fileDir = [docDir stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""funds.xls""];

file = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForReadingAtPath:fileDir];
if (file == nil) NSLog (@""Failed to open file"");

[file seekTOOffset: 10];
databuffer = [file readDataOfLength: 5];
[file closeFile];
</code></pre>

<p>It finds the directory of the file but gives up at <code>[NSFileHandle fileHandleForReadingAtPath:fileDir]</code>. </p>

<p>What should I be doing? I need help with confirming what file type I should use as the source, and how to read it into an array.</p>

<p>When this has been solved, I'm likely to need to read in large amount of data, several columns, 4k rows, a mixture of text &amp; non-integer numbers. </p>

<p>Is there a format or method I should be using when the volume of data is getting to that size?</p>

I have 3 Different Clients, C#,Delphi and Java. The Server is working with the C# and the Delphi, but with the Java Client it's not working as expected.</p>

<p>The Problem with the java client is, that i'm just receiving around 3/4 of the Data from the sended xml File. I watched the Debugger and every charakter of the Document is send by the Java client, but it's not received. It doesn't matter how long the Document is, there is always something missing.

<p>Show me all records in 2008, except those in November, unless they occurred on November 17th.</p>

<p>The query has to be generalized to working with more than just three clauses and should not be date specific.  (I'm asking using dates as an example because it's easy to understand - I'm interested in generalizing my MDX for different hierarchies.</p>

<p>This is the closest I've gotten so far:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
NON EMPTY {     [Measures].[Session Count] } ON COLUMNS, 
NON EMPTY {     ([SessionIDs].[Session ID].Children) } ON ROWS 
FROM (
      SELECT 
            Union(
                  Descendants([Start Date].[Date].Year.[2008], , LEAVES), 
                  Descendants([Start Date].[Date].[Date].&amp;[20081117], , LEAVES)
            )
            -
            Descendants([Start Date].[Date].[Month].&amp;[2008]&amp;[11], , LEAVES)
             ON COLUMNS
      FROM [ADM]  
) ;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the secondary inclusion (Nov 17, 2008) is eliminated by the exclusion.  I've tried maintaining duplicates in the first union, however Exclude (minus operator) eliminates all copies of members that match.</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>Here is another example to help in understanding what I mean when I ask for a ""generalizable"" solution.</p>

<p>Consider a mapping application where a user can select to see data in geographical regions of their choice.  They choose these regions by zooming in and out of the map, and selecting/deselecting <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259689.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">quadkeys</a>.  Quadkeys map neatly to a hierarchy, which is typically somewhere between 18 and 23 levels deep.</p>

<p>A valid use case would then be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Select   QK0</li>
<li>Deselect QK002</li>
<li>Select   QK0021230</li>
<li>Deselect QK002123033201 and QK002123033202 </li>
</ul>

<p>In words (and completely fabricating the place names that map to these quadkeys), this would be something like: Show me all of the data for North America but not data for USA unless that data is for New York State, but not in Albany or Glens Falls.</p>

<p>So the same query structure that worked for dates, above, must work for mapping or any other hierarchical set.  It is also worth noting that I'm constructing this MDX on the fly in response to user actions.</p>

<p>I can easily access the JSON file using the following declarations:</p>

NSString *documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0];
NSString *jsonPath = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""default.json""];
NSString *jsonString = [[NSString alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:jsonPath encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:NULL];

<p>The local path to the json file is:

<p>Now, when I try to lunch my app on iPhone, my app crashes. Very quick inspection of the debugger log demonstrates there might be a problem with the access to the file on iPhone.</p>

Our QA tester mashed the save button (client-side issue that was fixed, irrelevant to Q). Without a duplicate check, naturally this was saving duplicate entries to the db.</p>

<p>I implemented a duplicate check (duplicateCount just selects the number of items that are exactly like the item passed to post, should be 0, and it works, details irrelevant):</p>

<pre><code>        var duplicateCount = (fooCollection.CountAsync(aggregateFilter)).Result;
        if (duplicateCount &gt; 0) { return BadRequest(); }
</code></pre>

<p>This check works...except on the first button mash - two duplicate entries get saved, each from an individual controller hit. </p>

<p>So, it seems to me that the second controller hit happens before the first controller hit manages to save the item to the db, so the duplicate check passes. Is this possible? </p>

<p>I am more interested in the theory than the particular answer. Also, I know I can check for duplicates in the db as well, this is more of a conceptual question. The MongoDb part is really there just for completeness, I imagine it would be similar if I was doing an async save to SQL. </p>

<p>edit: Someone asked how I am making the call in comments. It's through RestAngular, but imo it's irrelevant because I know the controller is getting hit as many times as I hit the button. I also know for a fact that it does not create duplicates on a single hit. </p>

<p>I am trying to write automated tests for it through selenium web driver which I can run on a regular basis for regression testing. To test the extension, I need to first open the extension (generally we do it by clicking on the extension icon). </p>

<p>I have tried different ways of attempting to click on the extension icon but have not been successful. (For example, using the keyboard shortcut ALT - LEFT_ARROW - SPACE but that does not work through webdriver).</p>

<p>I have also tried this (mentioned <a href=""https://developer.chrome.com/apps/first_app"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>): </p>

<pre><code>options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument(""--app-id = mbopgmdnpcbohhpnfglgohlbhfongabi"")

<p>But above code does not help in opening extension.</p>

<p>I know some are ints and floats etc but I want them all to go in as char* then I can atoi or whatever when I need to use them.</p>

<p>The printf is just to view what I have loaded to test. If I use token %.*s it displays, if I use %s it segfaults at the printf line. I assume this means I am missing null pointers at the end of my strings??</p>

<p>Debugging suggests varTemp is using memory out of bounds. Additionally, when using printf with <code>%.*s</code> on rows with no data after first key, it prints COL 0 in COL 1 position as well where there should be a <code>NULL</code> pointer. i.e.:</p>

I'm trying to package non-java project artifacts (.NET) into a single zip file. I'm having 2 problems:</p>

<p>If I change packaging in my POM to zip <code>&lt;packaging&gt;zip&lt;/packaging&gt;</code>, I get this error message: <code>[INFO] Cannot find lifecycle mapping for packaging: 'zip'.
Component descriptor cannot be found in the component repository: org.apache.mav
en.lifecycle.mapping.LifecycleMappingzip.</code> OK, no big deal - I changed it to <code>&lt;packaging&gt;pom&lt;/packaging&gt;</code> to get rid of useless jar that is otherwise created in the target dir</p>

<p>My main problem is that files I'm packaging into ZIP are nested within few directories but I need put these into top directory of ZIP. Here's my assembly file:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;assembly&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;bin&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;formats&gt;
    &lt;format&gt;zip&lt;/format&gt;
  &lt;/formats&gt;
  &lt;fileSets&gt;
    &lt;fileSet&gt;
      &lt;directory&gt;${basedir}/${project.artifactId}&lt;/directory&gt;
      &lt;includes&gt;
        &lt;include&gt;**/Bin/Release/*.dll&lt;/include&gt;
        &lt;include&gt;**/Bin/Release/*.pdb&lt;/include&gt;
      &lt;/includes&gt;
    &lt;/fileSet&gt;
  &lt;/fileSets&gt;
&lt;/assembly&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I run this - I'll get ZIP file but files will be nested starting with C:\ followed by full path. To give you idea - project dumps it's binaries into the following structure
<code>ProjectFoo\ProjectFoo\subproject1\Bin\Release\foo.dll</code> and I need <code>ZIP\foo.dll</code></p>

<p>Here's assembly plugin configuration:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;plugin&gt;
&lt;artifactId&gt;maven-assembly-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;descriptors&gt;
        &lt;descriptor&gt;assembly.xml&lt;/descriptor&gt;
    &lt;/descriptors&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;executions&gt;
    &lt;execution&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;zip&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;phase&gt;package&lt;/phase&gt;
        &lt;goals&gt;
            &lt;goal&gt;single&lt;/goal&gt;
        &lt;/goals&gt;
    &lt;/execution&gt;
&lt;/executions&gt;

The book is a little outdated but pretty good still. My problem right now is that I can't guess how long my payload needs to be I tried to follow every step (and run gdb with the same arguments) and I tried to guess where the buffer starts, but I don't know exactly. I'm kind of new to this too so it makes sense.</p>

<p>I have a vulnerable program with <code>strcpy()</code> and a <code>buffer[512]</code>. I want to make the stack overflow, so I run some A's with the program (as the Erratas for the Shellcoders Handbook). I want to find how long the payload needs to be (no ASLR) so in theory I just need to find where the buffer is.</p>

<p>Since I'm new I can't post an image, but the preferred output from the book has a full 4 row of 'A's (0x41414141), and mine is like this:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) x/20xw $esp - 532         
0xbffff968 : 0x0000000  0xbfffffa0e 0x41414141 0x41414141
0xbffff968   0x41414141 0x41414141  0x00004141 0x0804834
</code></pre>

<p>What address is that? How I know where this buffer starts? I want to do this so I can keep working with the book. I realize that the buffer is somewhere in there because of the A's that I ran. But if I want to find how long the payload needs to be I need the point where it starts.</p>

<p>While in firefox it works fine, in chrome it does not.</p>

<p>This is what i do:</p>

<pre><code>document.addEventListener('webkitfullscreenchange', function(e) {
    var canv = gamvas.getCanvas();
    if (canv) {
        if (document.webkitIsFullScreen) {
            gamvas._isFullScreen = true;

            gamvas._isFullScreen = false;
            canv.style.width=canv.width+'px';
            canv.style.height=canv.height+'px';
        }
    }
}, false);
</code></pre>

<p>Then when i use canvas.webkitRequestFullscreen() the code above is called, it has the correct screen.width/height of the desktop, but it seems as the result is scaled. So either the browser sets a screenmode less then the desktop, or it upscales the canvas. The result is that the canvas does not match onto the screen and part flows over the right and lower screen border.</p>

<p>I have tried to work with -webkit-full-screen css to 100%, but while it works on vertical size, it still is off on the horizontal size</p>

Suppose I have two big data sets. The first one is a huge data set (about 50-100Gb!), which contains phone numbers. The second one contains prefixes (20-40 thousands observations).
I need to add the most appropriate prefix to the first table for each phone number.  </p>

<p>For example, if I have a phone number <code>+71230000</code> and prefixes</p>

<pre><code>+7
+71230
+7123
</code></pre>

<p>The most appropriate prefix is <code>+71230</code>.</p>

<p>My idea. First, sort the prefix table. Then in data step, process the phone numbers table</p>

<pre><code>data OutputTable;
    set PhoneNumbersTable end=_last;
    if _N_ = 1 then do;
        dsid = open('PrefixTable');
    end;
    /* for each observation in PhoneNumbersTable:
       1. Take the first digit of phone number (`+7`).
          Look it up in PrefixTable. Store a number of observation of
          this prefix (`n_obs`).
       2. Take the first TWO digits of the phone number (`+71`).
          Look it up in PrefixTable, starting with `n_obs + 1` observation.
          Stop when we will find this prefix
          (then store a number of observation of this prefix) or
          when the first digit will change (then previous one was the
          most appropriate prefix).
       etc....
    */
    if _last then do;
        rc = close(dsid);
    end;
run;
</code></pre>

<p>I hope my idea is clear enough, but if it's not, I'm sorry).</p>

<p>So what do you suggest?
Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>P.S. Of course, phone numbers in the first table are not unique (may be repeated), and my algorithm, unfortunately, doesn't use it.</p>

<p>What I have is a <code>ExportSettings.settings</code> file with a bunch of settings (bools, strings, ints, etc) and I want to create a View for them. In order to do it I've created a simple window in which I've placed  standard buttons as <code>OK</code>, <code>Cancel</code> and <code>Close</code> and linked them to a <code>KeyDown</code> event to let the user accept/cancel using Enter/Escape.</p>

<p>I've created in XAML the needed <code>Checkbox</code>, <code>TextBox</code>, etc, for my settings. When the ExportSettingsView class starts, in its constructor I read my settings and assign the value for each control. In past I bound them directly but that unables the cancelation of changes, so I discarded it. When the user clicks <code>OK</code> button I assign, again, code-behind each value for each settings. If he clicks <code>Cancel</code> no assignment is done and the window just closes.</p>

<p>I would like something like EditableObject for my settings to avoid this ugly looking way of making my SettingsView.</p>

<p>Some of the things I'm looking for are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Being able to put some comments in my settings would be nice (ToolTip)</li>
<li>Autogeneration of controls using reflection?</li>
<li>Avoid creating custom settings class (and the work of saving and reading everytime the application starts/shutsdown)</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this, lots of fragments do discards after a while, but as we know, these are threads probably stalling until all the other fragments have completed.</p>

<p>I was wondering. Since some opengl version, it is possible to write to the stencil buffer from the fragment shader. When I know I don't need another pass on a specific fragment, I could possible write to the stencil buffer. In the next rendering pass, I could turn on stencil testing to prevent those fragment from calculating again.</p>

<p>My question: will this prevent the stalling-problem? Will these threads become available to perform more of the still-to-be-processed fragments so that each pass will be faster than the previous when each pass eliminates fragments for the next pass?</p>

<p>In other words, say that I have a 16x16 texture I need to calculate. In the first pass, I will have to calculate 256 fragments (say that I have 16 cores, this would mean 16 cycles). If for example after this first pass, I know that I only need to calculate further on 128 fragments, and I have marked the fragments that are done in the stencil buffer, will this second pass perform twice as fast (so: 128 fragments on 16 cores = 8 cycles instead of 16)?</p>

<p>I hope the question is clear...</p>

<p>The thing is, when using the .find() method of mongoose, the object I get as response is full of properties I don't know where It came from (I'm guessing they are built-in properties, but whatever) and I want to iterate only through the properties I .select(). Got it? No? ok... explaining better:</p>

<p>I have my schema and model declared:</p>

<pre><code>var mySchema = mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  prop1: String,
  prop2: String,
  prop3: String
})
var myModel = DB.model('myDataBase', mySchema)
</code></pre>

<p>Then I want to find a document with the name, let's say, John and retrieve all but the 'name' field, so I go:</p>

<pre><code>myModel.find({name: 'John'}, '-name', function(err, results){
  log(results[0])
}
</code></pre>

<p>and log(results[0]) logs</p>

<pre><code>{ prop1: 'one',
  prop2: 'two',
  prop3: 'three' }
</code></pre>

<p>So far, so good. But the problems is, now I want to iterate through these properties and check one by one, and I don't know for sure how many 'props' each result will have, so I wanted to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>for(var key in results[0]){
  log(key)
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm hoping it will log 'prop1', 'prop2' and 'prop3', but no! Ok, I get props 1, 2 and 3, but also I get a lots of other properties and functions like: isNew, error, _maxListeners, _doc, etc. Not only these extras properties, I also get the 'name' property, the one I excluded from the selection (and it was excluded, like shown in the first log). Weird huh? </p>

<p>But wait! There's more! I've searched online and found some people saying ""Dude, when iterating through object properties use the hasOwnProperty method!"". So there I went:</p>

<pre><code>for (var key in results[0]){
  if (results[0].hasOwnProperty(key)) log(key)
}
</code></pre>

<p>the log result is a few properties (to be specific: $__, isNew, error, _maxListeners, _doc, _pres, _posts, save, _events) and doesnt include any of the props I wanted in the first place.</p>

<p>My question is, how can I iterate through only prop 1, 2 and 3, excluding these, I don't know, built-in properties and the one I explicitly excluded in the parameters? (ps: I was thinking of a solution that doesnt involve having to convert my object into an array, if thats possible)</p>

<p>Also, not a question per se, but for curiosity, where does these properties come from? Why do they appear in the for loop and not when I log the object? Why the property I excluded ('-name') also appears in the for loop? What the hell is hasOwnProperty for if it doesnt recognize the properties that were just logged?</p>

<p>Thanks for your time and help!
Bye!</p>

<p>My goal is to use javascript (if possible) to remove the entire <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> that contains <code>""Something 2""</code> , the  itself wont change at all but the order of the lists might.. so using css like:</p>

<pre><code>.content ul:nth-child(2) {
    display:none;
}
</code></pre>

<p>isn't an option sadly. Also I have no ability to use PHP to do this either. Can something like this be done with javascript? and how?</p>

<p>Now I would like to indicate what item on the left is having it's details shown on the right and here I'm having a problem.</p>

<p>In a normal list view I have achieved this by setting the choice mode for the list view to single and then using a state drawable based on the ""activated"" state.  When I click the item, the background is set to my selected color and stays that way until I select another item on the list.</p>

I'm not sure if I'm not setting the choice mode properly for it (I've tried it in the layout file as well as programatically, it doesn't seem to make a difference), or pointing it to the wrong thing (not sure how that could be, but...)</p>

<p>These symbols are part of <code>libresolv</code>, which is included at <code>/usr/lib/libresolv.dylib</code> on OS X (and has been since <em>at least</em> 10.4). Note that <code>*.dylib</code> files are the Mac equivalent of <code>*.so</code> files on Linux, and I've successfully compiled in <code>libiconv.dylib</code> already by passing <code>--with-iconv=shared,/usr</code> to <code>./configure</code>, which eliminated similar linker errors for the <code>iconv</code> library.</p>

<p>When I run <code>./configure</code>, it detects <code>/usr/include/resolv.h</code> and enables it in the makefile. However, I can't seem to figure out how to get the shared library to link in correctly. Any tips on getting that to work? I've never done anything like passing custom linker flags to <code>./configure</code>, and Google has been no help to me for this problem, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Now, I would like to build my native installer (setup) having those addtional folders/files extracted together with my application and runtime.</p>

<p>Basically when my native installer is ran, it will create these files:</p>

<pre><code>-&gt; app
   -&gt; lib
   -&gt; application.jar
   -&gt; package.cfg
-&gt; runtime
   -&gt; jre

-&gt; unins000.dat
-&gt; unins000.exe
</code></pre>

<p>My additional files and folders are not included in my installer. I would like to have my installer with those additional files extracted, preferably like this</p>

<p>the reason for this must be the declaration of the table, but I'm not sure. I checked the database using adb shell and i can't see the table exists and has a value inside it but the error says no such column exist.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SQL Source Control doesn't support SQL Server 2000, SQL Express, SQL Azure or SSMS Express</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been evaluating their product and assumed based off this statement that ""doesn't support"" meant ""will not work"". However, I have made admittedly trivial changes to a central SQL Server Standard Edition database FROM a local SQL Express edition installation. </p>

<p>SQL Server edition differences notwithstanding - I am wondering what pitfalls this kind of architecture would have, again, strictly from a SQL Source Control perspective. We are looking for a way to bridge the gap between our planned upgrade to SQL Server 2012 from 2008 R2, and do not want to purchase 2008 dev edition licenses knowing that we have months until we start on our upgrade path.</p>

<p>Is anyone implementing a dedicated database development model with SQL Express on developer machines?</p>
