"19889075","1","19889293","","2013-11-10 11:19:25","","0","418","<p>I am coding in blueJ. My objectives are this: 1)Write a User class</p>

<p>A User:</p>

<pre><code>has a username e.g 'fj3'
has a userType which can be: 'user', 'editor' or 'admin'
has a name e.g 'Francis'
has a constructor which takes the username, userType and name as parameters
has a getUsername() method
has a getUserType() method
has a getName() method
has a setUserType() method which takes one of the user types as a parameter 
</code></pre>

<p>2)Write a UserGroup class</p>

<p>The UserGroup class must have an ArrayList of Users.</p>

<p>Write a constructor for the UserGroup class. It should instantiate the ArrayList.</p>

<p>In UserGroup write a method called .addSampleData() which creates 10 Users and using the ArrayList's add() method put the 10 new User objects into the ArrayList.</p>

<p>In UserGroup write a getUser method which takes an int as a parameter and returns the User in that slot of the ArrayList.</p>

<p>In UserGroup write a printUsernames() method in UserGroup:</p>

<p>Using an enhanced for loop (see above), loop through the ArrayList and print the username and userType of each user in the ArrayList.</p>

<p>What I have so far is:</p>

<pre><code>package user;
public class User{
    public enum UserType{                           
        ADMIN, EDITOR, USER;
    }

    private String id;                             
    private UserType userPermissions;               
    private String actualName;                      

    public User(String username, UserType userType, String name){
        id = username;
        userPermissions = userType;
        actualName= name;
    } 

    public String getUsername(){
        return id;
    }

    public UserType getUserType(){
        return userPermissions;
    }       

    public String getName(){
        return actualName;
    }

    public void setUserType(UserType input){
        userPermissions = input;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And my UserGroup class:</p>

<pre><code>package user;
import java.util.*;
import user.User.UserType; 

public class UserGroup{

    private ArrayList&lt;User&gt; people;

    public UserGroup(){
        people = new Arraylist&lt;User&gt;();
    }

    public static void addSampleData(String username, UserType userType, String name){
        people.add(new User(username, userType,name));
    }

    public User get(int){
        return User; 
    }

    public void printUsernames(){
        for (User user: groupArray){
            System.out.printf(""%s %s\n"", user.getUsername(), user.getuserType);
        }
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is obviously far from being complete but I am completely stuck. My first problem is that I am unsure how to write the get method for this. Please help me with this!! I think my User class is fine but my UserGroup class is nowhere near completing all the objectives and I don't know how to do them!!</p>

"25084802","1","","","2014-08-01 16:33:22","","0","91","<p>I just wanted to add an animation to my Dialog box when appearing and disappearing, there I found this thread:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4817014/animate-a-custom-dialog"">Animate a custom Dialog</a></p>

<p>I did as it was described, here's my code:</p>

<pre><code> Dialog dialog = new Dialog(this, android.R.style.Theme_Black_NoTitleBar_Fullscreen);
    dialog.requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);
    dialog.getWindow().getAttributes().windowAnimations = R.style.FinishDialog;
    dialog.setCancelable(true);   
    dialog.setCanceledOnTouchOutside(true);    
    dialog.setContentView(R.layout.dialog_next);
    dialog.show();
</code></pre>

<p>I chose android.R.style.Theme_Black_NoTitleBar_Fullscreen because I wanted to have a fullscreen dialog box which appears within an animation. This animation is called ""R.style.FinishDialog""
Here's the code for that:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style name=""FinishDialog"" parent=""@android:style/Theme.Dialog""&gt;
    &lt;item name=""android:windowAnimationStyle""&gt;@style/FinishDialogAnimation&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;style name=""FinishDialogAnimation""&gt;
    &lt;item name=""android:windowEnterAnimation""&gt;@anim/slide_down&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item name=""android:windowExitAnimation""&gt;@anim/slide_up&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As You can see I declared two animations, here are those codes:</p>

<p><strong>slide_down.xml:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;set xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""&gt;
&lt;translate android:fromYDelta=""0%"" android:toYDelta=""100%"" android:duration=""300""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p><strong>slide_up.xml:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;set xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""&gt;
&lt;translate android:fromYDelta=""100%"" android:toYDelta=""0%"" android:duration=""300""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>Now, when calling the dialog.show() method, the dialog just pops up without animation. I've checked my settings and all animations are enabled. </p>

<p>What might I have overseen?</p>

The fact is that I read about some bugs in some ram disk applications bug lists(ex.: imdisk) related to file corruption. Solved bugs but I'm wondering if ram disk apps are secure from file integrity point of view. On the other hand neither a normal disk is 100% secure. My temp file is absolutely important for me.

{
    return derivative_1_Richardson_6O(fn,  x);

<p>The way I call this function is by using a lambda in place of the std::function</p>

<pre><code>analysis al;
std::cout &lt;&lt; al.differentiateBest([](double x) { return x*x*x*x*x*x; }, 2)
</code></pre>

<p>I want to extend the derivative to Higher Dimension. ie.Take a gardient. </p>

<pre><code>// matrix&lt;T&gt; my class for holding matrices , implemented as 1D std::vector
matrix&lt;double&gt; analysis::gradient_2D(std::function&lt;double(double, double)&gt; fn,double x, double y)

    matrix&lt;double&gt; R(2, 1);

//DOUBT
    std::function&lt;double(double xVar)&gt; fnX = fn( xVar, y); //ERROR
    // creates a new fn which holds y constant and allows x to vary  

    std::function&lt;double(double yVar)&gt; fnY = fn( x, yVar); //ERROR
    // creates a new fn which holds x constant and allows y to vary 

    R(1, 1) = differentiateBest(fnX,x); // Takes derivative in X direction , holding y constant 
    R(1, 2) = differentiateBest(fnY,y);  // Takes derivative in Y direction , holding x constant 

return R; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the way I will call gradient is </p>

<pre><code>analysis al; 
matrix&lt;double&gt; R = al.gradient_2D([](double x,double y) { return x*x*x*y + y; }, 2 ,3) ; 
// Takes the gradient of lambda function at the point  2 , 3

<p>This is what I want to do. But I get error in VS at this line </p>

<p>I want to make the 2D function into a 1D function , by fixing the x or y value. 
The x or y values are fixed at the point at which we want to take the gradient.</p>

<p>So my question is how can I convert a std::function taking 2 variables into a function taking a single variable . </p>

  <p>Edit: no need to worry about file type. iOS images should ALWAYS be 24bit PNG</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my workflow, I'll get my image all set then go through this same exact ritual every time:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save for Web &amp; Devices</li>
<li>Press Save and choose a filename, like ""myimage@2x.png""</li>
<li>Save for Web &amp; Devices again</li>
<li>Reduce image size by 50%</li>
<li>Press Save and choose a similar filename like ""myimage.png""</li>
</ol>

<p>My dream photoshop script would
1. Ask for a filename &amp; location: i.e. present a typical save dialog
2. I'd enter a name ""myimage""
3. it would save the current document as ""myimage@2x"" in that location, and then save a 50% reduced image named ""myimage"" also in that location</p>

<p>Any ideas?  I've poked around the photoshop scripting reference but its a bit overwhelming.</p>

<p>But not sure I'll get that all in one go so can settle for an array of Categories and Amounts under each date pair that I can then deal with to get the above somehow:</p>

<pre><code>[

     EndDate: 2013/1/16,
     Categories: [ { 10, 25 } ],

   },
   {
     Expiry: 2013/2/6,
     EndDate: 2013/2/20,
     Categories: [ { 10, 25 } ],
     Amounts: [ { 14.43, 14.76 } ]
   },
]
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to use the groupby function in the linq.js library to get the necessary JSON but can't get to what I need.</p>

<p>With the following:</p>

<pre><code>var result = linq.groupBy(""$.Expiry"", """", ""k,e =&gt; { Expiry: k, Categories: e.select('$.Category').toArray(), Amounts: e.select('$.Amount').toArray()}"").toArray();
</code></pre>

<p>I get:</p>

<pre><code>[
   {

The exploit relies on Bash parsing some environment variable declarations as function definitions, but then continuing to execute code following the definition:</p>

<pre><code>$ x='() { echo i do nothing; }; echo vulnerable' bash -c ':'
vulnerable
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't get it. There's nothing I've been able to find in the Bash manual about interpreting environment variables as functions at all (except for <em>inheriting functions</em>, which is different). Indeed, a proper named function definition is just treated as a value:</p>

<pre><code>$ x='y() { :; }' bash -c 'echo $x'
y() { :; }
</code></pre>

<p>But a corrupt one prints nothing:</p>

<pre><code>$ x='() { :; }' bash -c 'echo $x'

$ # Nothing but newline
</code></pre>

<p>The corrupt function is unnamed, and so I can't just call it. Is this vulnerability a pure implementation bug, or is there an intended feature here, that I just can't see?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Per Barmar's comment, I hypothesized the name of the function was the parameter name:</p>

<pre><code>$ n='() { echo wat; }' bash -c 'n'
wat
</code></pre>

<p>Which I could swear I tried before, but I guess I didn't try hard enough. It's repeatable now. Here's a little more testing:</p>

<pre><code>$ env n='() { echo wat; }; echo vuln' bash -c 'n'
vuln
wat
$ env n='() { echo wat; }; echo $1' bash -c 'n 2' 3 -- 4

wat
</code></pre>

<p>…so apparently the args are not set at the time the exploit executes.</p>

<p>Anyway, the basic answer to my question is, <em>yes, this is how Bash implements inherited functions</em>.</p>

In the meanwhile, I must consider power consumption which means reduce power consumption while using wireless. I am thinking about 3 possible wireless technologies for this app:</p>

<ul>
<li>wifi direct (p2p wifi) - fast, reliable, but not supported on many phones (even ones with Android >=4.0) (you would also probably need to two devices to test/develop this)</li>
<li>regular wifi - fast, reliable, but requires at least an access point (i.e. some infrastructure, or another mobile device acting in part as an access point but does NOT Need internet access), code partially compatible with wifi direct</li>
<li>Bluetooth - slow, unreliable, supported on most devices, requires no infrastructure (also probably need two devices to develop), code least </li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding these mentioned wireless technologies, I have few questions listed below (please consider that I need acceptable evidences or documentations to support my ideas):</p>

<ol>
<li>Which of these technologies consume less power?</li>
<li>How can I reduce power consumption in android phone?</li>

<p>I have an android activity, widget and service. The service runs sound in the background, either for a set amount of time or continuously. Because I want the sound to run until stop is hit, I don't have a stopSelf() method in the service. This was all fine and dandy with the activity because I had it startService on play, and stopService on stop. Now I want to throw a widget in this latest update. So here's where I'm stuck. Because it's a broadcast receiver, I'm very limited in what it can do. I can call context.stopService, but I only want to stop the service when the button is pressed. I can only find a way to set an onClickListener with a pendingIntent.</p>

<p>In my service's onStartCommand() method, I read the ""loops"" extra from the incoming intent. So I tried just passing in a value of zero, but for some reason it doesn't seem to read it. I know the onStartCommand() is being called in the service because the music is playing, but regardless of what extra I throw on the intent, it doesn't seem to read it and I have no idea why. So my question is, what is the best strategy to use to stop a service from a widget's button? I'm hoping it's an easy answer, otherwise I guess I could create a new activity or broadcast receiver to handle the button click, but that seems so unnecessary. Any advice would be very much appreciated! Thanks! </p>

<p>In a particular situation I need to know the value of the next element before iteration comes to that(like a prediction) element. For that I am planning to use the function <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.next.php"" rel=""nofollow"">next()</a>.</p>

<p>In documentation I just noticed that next() advances the internal array pointer forward.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>next() behaves like current(), with one difference. It advances the
  internal array pointer one place forward before returning the element
  value. That means it returns the next array value and advances the
  internal array pointer by one.</p>

<p>If so will it affect my foreach loop?</p>

<p>I found some tutorials and it seems that Twinkle is one of the most useful apps for that. </p>

<p>So i successfully installed twinkle on my RPI, one SPI-Client on my Android-Phone and for know i am able to send text messages from one to another. </p>

<p>The thing is: I have to use the Twinkel GUI with X-Server-forwarding (currently using MacOS with X11 and iTerm). </p>

<p>But i kind of want to automate the whole process, like using twinkle from command line, controll it with scripts etc. </p>

<p>So, obviously twinkle is not made for that. (there dont even is a documentation for the account-config-file, so i had to struggle through that x11-forwarding-stuff)</p>

<p>So, my final question is:
Is there comparable SIP-client for the RPI that can be controlled via CLI?</p>

<p>any hint is highly appreciated. While googling this question i just found projects working with asterisk-server on the RPI or attaching displays to it - but thats not what i am looking for...</p>

<p>The variant <code>&lt;p:editor value=""#{multiEditorBacking.eval(editor).text}"" id=""textArea"" /&gt;</code> has trouble if setter will be called. But <code>&lt;p:editor value=""#{editor.text}"" id=""textArea"" /&gt;</code> is ok. The following examples can be used for testing.</p>

<p>A relevant point might be that the post is fired by kendoChart. Here the interesting block inside the view:</p>

<pre><code>....

@this.ScriptBlock(
@&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

                         contentType: ""application/json; charset=utf-8""
                     }
                 },
                 sort: ...
 ....
</code></pre>

<p>To check whether the problems are related to the kendoChart-Object, I testwisely implemented a manual POST:</p>

<pre><code>....
&lt;div class=""round-corner-bottom-right""&gt;
        &lt;button id=""send-form"" type=""button""&gt;
            &lt;span class=""button-label""&gt;Send Form Data&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
....

@this.ScriptBlock(
@&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

     $('document').ready(function () {

        $('#send-form').on('click', function () {

             var data = $('form').serialize();

             $.ajax({
                 type: ""POST"",
                 url: actionUrl,
                 data: data,
                 cache: false,
                 success: function (returnData) {
                 }
             });

     }); // document ready
</code></pre>

<p>The problem does not persist in this scenario, all values are set as expected. So there seems to be a problem with the kendoChart-methode.</p>

<p>And I have three implementations of this: ISqlFooRepository, IFileFooRepostory, and IMockFooRepository.</p>

<p>I also have some test cases. What I would like to do, and haven't worked out how to do yet, is to run the same test cases against each of these three implementations, and have a green tick for each test pass on each interface type.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>[TestMethod]
Public void GetFoo_NotNull_Test()
{
   IFooRepository repository = GetRepository();
   var results = repository. GetFoo();
   Assert.IsNotNull(results);

<p>I want this test method to be run three times, with some variation in the environment that allows it to get three different kinds of repository. At present I have three cut-and-pasted test classes that differ only in the implementation of the private helper method IFooRepository GetRepository(); Obviously, this is smelly.</p>

<p>However, I cannot just remove duplication by consolidating the cut and pasted methods, since they need to be present, public and marked as test for the test to run.</p>

<p>I am using the Microsoft testing framework, and would prefer to stay with it if I can. But a suggestion of how to do this in, say, MBUnit would also be of some interest.</p>

<p>1) Once I locate the Mozilla install directory via the Window's registry, is Windows 7's security layer going to prevent my ""setup"" program from writing files to FireFox's program directory?  If so, how does one work around this?</p>

<p>Basically I have a DataGrid with comboboxes in the headers that I use for filtering the DataGrid items. The DataGrid sits in a Tabcontrol and if I select items in the comboxes and switch tab and back the selected items are removed. </p>

<p>This happens only when the ItemsSource of the Comboboxes have the IsAsync property set to True. Otherwise everything works just like I want it to.</p>

<p>To give some more info about the logic:
The comboboxes get their values from a IValueConverter its the same converter for all comboboxes and I pass a ConverterParameter to tell it what to return. The collection sent to the converter is the items shown in the datagrid. 
These values are refreshed (each item has selected parameters updated, the collection is not cleared and recreated) when the tab is activated. </p>

<p>This my xaml for one of the comboboxes:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;ComboBox SelectedItem=""{Binding MadeBy}"" ItemsSource=""{Binding IssuesView,Converter={StaticResource DataGridFilterableValueConverter}"",ConverterParameter=Madeby, IsAsync=true}"" SelectionChanged=""FilterComboBox_SelectionChanged""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, like i described previously, if I set the IsAsync to false the selecteditems stay. </p>

<p>Do I just have to live with this? We work alot with sql-databases and IsAsync really makes the interface alot more snappy. I can live without it in the comboboxes, but I tend to use it as much as I can. </p>

<p>I've seen that ppl have been having problems with the selecteditem and the general solution seems to be placing the SelectedItem before the ItemsSource, but this does not help. </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Erik</p>

<p>Edit 1:
Here is the xaml of the tabcontrol and tabitem.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TabControl Grid.Row=""1"" x:Name=""TabControl"" SelectionChanged=""TabControl_SelectionChanged""&gt;
           &lt;TabItem Header=""Granskningssynpunkter"" x:Name=""IssueTab""&gt;

<p>I have a Java EE application that shall be able to run in a cluster (it actually does). For the data exchange between the nodes I use Hazelcast 3.3.3.
Since our customers are afraid of UDP we use TCP.
So I configure 3 hazelcast parameters per node:
The network interface to use, the port and the members of the cluster.
In real life (not a docker environment) everything works.
Now I want to put my Java EE servers into docker containers (one per node) and also link them via Hazelcast.</p>

<p>What I did was:</p>

<p>On the host machine running the docker containers I created several virtual network interfaces (172.21.0.X).
for each docker container I gave network mappings like -p 172.21.0.X:5190:5190 (5190 is the port I use for Hazelcast)</p>

<p>In my Java EE application within the container I configured hazelcast to listen to interface 172.21.0.X, port 5190 members 172.21.0.X:5190,......
The problem now is: docker will assign an internal IP number to each cointainer. In advance I cannot be sure which IP number docker will assign.
It definitly is not the IP I would like to use (172.21.0.X).
Hazelcast starts up and tells me: no matching interface found. Of course not.
Hazelcast will check the IP interfaces of the docker container which is something like 172.4.XX. This does not fit to the config I gave to hazelcast (use 172.21.X.X).</p>

<p>So far it seems not to be possible to specify the internal IP number of a docker container. I could query it from a running container, but that is too late since I need to do the configuration of my Java EE server BEFORE I start the container.</p>

<p>Any hints on that? Is it possible to get the Hazelcast running with TCPIP?</p>

What I want to be able to do is:<br></p>

<p>1) use python to pull daily close data from quandl for n securities<br> 
2) store the data in a database<br> 
3) retrieve, clean, and normalize the data<br> 
4) run regressions on different pairs<br> 
5) write the results to a csv file<br></p>

<p>The pseudo code below shows in a nutshell what I want to be able to do.<br><br>
The questions I have are:<br>
How do I store the quandl data in MySQL?<br>
How do I retrieve that data from MySQL? Do I store it into lists and use statsmodels?<br></p>

<pre><code>tickers = [AAPL, FB, GOOG, YHOO, XRAY, CSCO]
qCodes = [x + 'WIKI/' for x in tickers]
for i in range(0, len(qCodes)):
    ADD TO MYSQLDB-&gt;Quandl.get(qCodes[i], collapse='daily', start_date=start, end_date=end)

for x in range(0, len(qCodes)-1):
    for y in range(x+1, len(qCodes)):

<p>I want to track What will be deleted When with a db.Model class (<em>DeleteQueueItem</em>), as I found no way to delete a task from the queue and suspect I can query what's there.</p>

<p>Creating a <em>DeleteQueueItem</em> entity should automatically set a <em>delete_when</em> property and add a task to the queue. I use the relative path of blog posts as their <em>key_name</em> and want to use that as <em>key_name</em> here, too. This led me to a custom <strong>init</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>class DeleteQueueItem(db.Model):
    """"""Model to keep track of items that will be deleted via task queue.""""""

    # URL path to the blog post is handled as key_name
    delete_when = db.DateTimeProperty()

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        delay = 120  # Seconds
        t = datetime.timedelta(seconds=delay)
        deadline = datetime.datetime.now() - t
        key_name = kwargs.get('key_name')

        db.Model.__init__(self, **kwargs)
        self.delete_when = deadline

        taskqueue.add(url='/admin/task/delete_page', 
                      countdown=delay,
                      params={'path': key_name})

<p>This seems to work, until I try to delete the entity:</p>

<pre><code>fetched_item = models.DeleteQueueItem.get_by_key_name(path)

<p>Previously, I was having problems with printing non-english text from a simple java program. The problem was with encoding used for the source file. I changed it to UTF-8 and could then print unicode text by embedding them into the program. Now all my source files are encoded using UTF-8. Could this be related to the above mentioned problem in any way?
By any chance, do I have to mention the encoding to be used for the message to be sent? If so, how do I do this?</p>

<p>Just to put in more context, this is observed in a web application that is hosted over google app engine and the program is written in java.</p>

<p>Formats and topics produces arrays derived from an AJAX post</p>

<p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong></p>

<p>Break the array into individual strings and compare each string with its respective query item using php internal function in_array</p>

<p>However, I am not sure how to implement it.</p>

<p>Below is the code:</p>

<pre><code>  $formatsArray = $_POST['formats'];
  $topicsArray = $_POST['topics'];
</code></pre>

<p>I am using in_array because Implode did not work:</p>

<pre><code>  $formats = implode('"",""', $formatsArray);
   $topics = implode('"",""', $topicsArray);

   $resources = ""select * from resources where
                 stage LIKE '%"".$stage.""%'
                 AND format IN("".$formats."")
                 AND topic IN("".$topics."") "";
</code></pre>

<p>stage is just a string not an array.</p>

<p>I would like to use in-array within the query,</p>

<p>How the array is created (in javscript):</p>

<pre><code>optionScope = $(this);
// Stage 4 option A
var formats = [];
optionScope.data().formats = formats;

stage4_optiona.on('click', function(){

  continue4.css('opacity', '1');
    continue4.on('click', function(){
    optionScope.data().formats.push(""Online classroom"");

        stage5.show();
        stage4.hide();
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>then post</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
        /* attach a submit handler to the form */
$(function(){
  optionScope = $(this);                    // wait until dom is ready

$(""#formMail"").submit(function(event) {
  /* stop form from submitting normally */
  event.preventDefault();      /* stop form from submitting normally */

          $.ajax({
              url: ""functions/contact.php"",
              type: ""post"",
              data: {stage : optionScope.data().stage,
                    topics: optionScope.data().topic,
                    formats: optionScope.data().formats,
                    fname: $('#fname').val(),
                    email: $('#email').val(),
                    humancheck: $('#humancheck').val()
                  },
              success: function (response) {
                  console.log(""data sent successfully"");

                  window.location = response;


              },
              error: function (xhr, desc, err) {

<p>I want to detect when a user presses and releases a key in Java Swing, ignoring the keyboard auto repeat feature. I also would like a pure Java approach the works on Linux, Mac OS and Windows.</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>When the user presses some key I want to know what key is that;</li>
<li>When the user releases some key, I want to know what key is that;</li>
<li>I want to ignore the system auto repeat options: I want to receive just one keypress event for each key press and just one key release event for each key release;</li>
<li>If possible, I would use items 1 to 3 to know if the user is holding more than one key at a time (i.e, she hits 'a' and without releasing it, she hits ""Enter"").</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem I'm facing in Java is that under Linux, when the user holds some key, there are many keyPress and keyRelease events being fired (because of the keyboard repeat feature).</p>

<p>I've tried some approaches with <strong>no success</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the last time a key event occurred - in Linux, they seem to be zero for key repeat, however, in Mac OS they are not;</li>
<li>Consider an event only if the current keyCode is different from the last one - this way the user can't hit twice the same key in a row;</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is the basic (non working) part of code:</p>

<pre><code>import java.awt.event.KeyListener;

public class Example implements KeyListener {

public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {
}

public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
    System.out.println(""KeyPressed: ""+e.getKeyCode()+"", ts=""+e.getWhen());
}

public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {
    System.out.println(""KeyReleased: ""+e.getKeyCode()+"", ts=""+e.getWhen());
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>When a user holds a key (i.e, 'p') the system shows:</p>

<pre><code>KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637271673
KeyReleased: 80, ts=1253637271923
KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637271923
KeyReleased: 80, ts=1253637271956
KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637271956
KeyReleased: 80, ts=1253637271990
KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637271990
KeyReleased: 80, ts=1253637272023
KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637272023
...
</code></pre>

<p>At least under Linux, the JVM keeps resending all the key events when a key is being hold. To make things more difficult, on my system (Kubuntu 9.04 Core 2 Duo) the timestamps keep changing. The JVM sends a key new release and new key press with the same timestamp. This makes it hard to know when a key is really released.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>My first approach looks like this</p>

<pre><code>    @Query(""SELECT m, (6371 * acos(cos(radians(:latitude)) * cos(radians(m.latitude)) * cos(radians(m.longitude) - radians(:longitude)) + sin(radians(:latitude)) * sin(radians(m.latitude)))) as dist FROM Entity m WHERE dist &lt; :distance ORDER BY dist DESC"")
    public List&lt;Entity&gt; findEntitiesByLocation(@Param(""latitude"") final double latitude, @Param(""longitude"") final double longitude, @Param(""distance"") final double distance, Pageable pageable);
</code></pre>

<p>but it fails as Spring/JPA seems to be not capable of using aliases in the where clause. The SQL in the stacktrace looks like this</p>

<pre><code>select (...),(haversine) as col_1_0_ where dist&lt;? order by col_1_0_ DESC
</code></pre>

<p>so the alias in the where clause is not replaced. Using ""col_1_0_"" (without the "") instead of dist also does not work.</p>

<p>According to this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/153641/1089459"">SO Answer</a>, at least MySQL is interpreted inside out and using aliases in the Where clause is not possible. A suggested solution would be using HAVING instead of WHERE, but also in a HAVING clause, the alias is not resolved.</p>

<p>I know that I can move the Haversine Formula into the where clause, but I still need it in the Order By clause and I think it might slow down performance using the same long Haversine formula in the Order By clause as I select from a few hundred thousands entities.</p>

<p>I then tried to create the Query manually but I don't know how to apply the Pageable to this:</p>

<pre><code>    @Override
    public List&lt;Entity&gt; findEntitiesByLocation(final double latitude, final double longitude, final double distance, Pageable pageable) {
    final javax.persistence.Query query = this.entityManager.createQuery(SELECT_ENTITES_BY_DISTANCE);

    query.setParameter(""latitude"", latitude);
    query.setParameter(""longitude"", longitude);
    query.setParameter(""distance"", distance);

    final List&lt;Entity&gt; entities = query.getResultList();
    // order by distance
    entities .sort(new EntityDistanceComparator(latitude, longitude));

    return entities ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, I either need the first approach with @Query to work (which I'd prefer) OR the second approach with Pageable</p>

<p>That would be fine if the mixin wasn't defined, but it is, and it works fine in the ~10 previously imported files.</p>

<p>It kind of looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>@import ""templates/mixins.less"";
@import ""templates/page.less"";
...more files...
@import ""templates/template-archive-post.less"";
</code></pre>

<p>Somewhere in the mid/bottom it's like it just ignores the mixin file. Same thing applies to variables. If i define a variable at the top of style.less, i cannot access it from one of the last imported files.</p>

<p>Is this a known bug? Is there a limit as to how many files you can import? I am using the Less Compile package for Sublime Text 2 to compile, although i have also tried compiling with LessJS in the browser.</p>

<p>You can download it and try to compile it yourself if you wish. Here's a zip of it all:
<a href=""https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B84GsEudzx6ZWVlGS0lJZ3Azc0U/edit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B84GsEudzx6ZWVlGS0lJZ3Azc0U/edit</a></p>

<p>Go to Archive -> Download to get the entire zip.</p>

<p>Compile the style.less file in the root.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Quick and dirty solution, it seems to work after including the mixins file again right before the file(s) that fail. Super ugly, but it works. For now.</p>

<p>This works fine. The problem is, converting to new-style signals and slots (where the signal is not passed as an argument) makes this more complicated. In new-style signal and slot, the above would be <em>something</em> like:</p>

<p>This only happens on iOS. The android version doesn't have issues with the replications (maybe the design documents are ignored?)</p>

<ul>
<li>Why does the replication try to sync design documents on ios and
not on android? </li>
<li>Should design documents be synched?</li>
<li>Is there a way to prevent certain document of being synched? (Native api's provide a filtering mechanism on replications, but the rest-api does not)</li>
</ul>

<p>Any idea what could be the problem here?</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Bert</p>

"30768467","1","31038477","","2015-06-10 22:34:34","","-2","18","<p>I wanted to check the viability of the design approach to use Message Oriented middle-ware (MOM) technology like JMS or ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ for handling asynchronous processing within single web application i.e. the publisher and the subscriber to the MOM server will be contained in the same web application.
The rationale behind this design is to offload some of the heavy duty processing functionality as a background asynchronous operation. The publisher in this case is the server side real-time web service method which need to respond back instantaneously (&lt; than 1 sec) to the calling web service client and the publisher emits the message on MOM Topic. The subscriber is contained in the same web application as the publisher and the subscriber uses the message to asynchronously processes the complex slightly more time consuming (5-7 seconds) functionality.
With this design we can avoid having to spawn new threads within the application server container for handling the heavy duty complex processing functionality.</p>

<p>Does using MOM server in this case an overkill  where the message publisher and message subscriber are contained in the same web server address space? From what I have read MOM tech is used mainly for inter-application communication and wanted to check if it is fine to use MOM for intra-application communication.</p>

To make a long story short, I would like to display problematic segments along a route and show the severity by using a color code (say green, yellow, red, etc.). I know this is a pretty common scenario and have come to understand that the ""right way"" of accomplishing this task is to create a linear event table which will allow me to assign different codes to certain route segments. Some of my colleagues know how to do it manually but I can't seem to find any way to replicate this programaticaly.</p>

<p>The current tool is written in C# and already performs all the needed calculations to determine the problematic areas. The problem mainly is that I don't know where to start since I don't know a lot about ArcObjects. Any code sample or suggestion is welcome (C# is preferred but C++, VB and others will surely help me anyway).</p>

</ul>

<p>They are nice, and offer many advantages above &amp; beyond MFC's CArchive.</p>

<p>The main goal of the effort (other than an XML store) is to minimize code changes to this legacy app. I don't need new/improved serialization functionality for this project, and ideally, I could change a few CArchive objects to CXmlArchive and, like a puff of orange smoke, the store is XML.</p>

<p>Do you know of an existing library that meets the above requirements?</p>

</code></pre>

<p><strong>What I want</strong></p>

<p>In a small set of data, the above code works. But what if I want to go up to say <code>Array(2700,1)</code>? This means I will have to write it <code>46</code> times <code>Array(0, 1), Array(60, 1)...Array(1080, 1)....Array(2700, 1)</code></p>

<p><strong>What I have tried</strong></p>

<p>I tried using this approach</p>

<pre><code>Sub Sample()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim MyArray
    Dim MyStr As String
    Dim i As Long

    For i = 0 To 2700 Step 60
        MyStr = MyStr &amp; ""#"" &amp; ""Array("" &amp; i &amp; "",1)""
    Next i

    MyStr = Mid(MyStr, 2)

    MyArray = Split(MyStr, ""#"")

    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets(""Sheet1"")

    ws.Columns(1).TextToColumns _

<p>Obviously that won't work as <code>Array(i,1)</code> is stored as a string in <code>MyArray</code>.</p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>At the moment I can get everything in 1 query however there is an issue when trying to <code>ORDER BY ForumPosts.id</code>, I think this is due to the <code>GROUP BY</code> combined with the joins.</p>

<p>This means I have all of the required data but it's not in the order of the latest forum post. </p>

<p><strong>Current incorrect query</strong></p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  ForumThreads.title, 
  SUBSTRING_INDEX(GROUP_CONCAT(ForumPosts.user_id ORDER BY ForumPosts.id ASC), ',', 1),
  MAX(ForumPosts.`post_time`),
  SUBSTRING_INDEX(GROUP_CONCAT(ForumPosts.user_id ORDER BY ForumPosts.id DESC), ',', 1)

  forumThreads

    ON ForumThreads.forum_room_id = ForumRooms.id

    ON ForumThreads.id = ForumPosts.`forum_thread_id` 
WHERE ForumRooms.id = 1

<p>Here is a Fiddle:  <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/m1erickson/qmEBE/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/m1erickson/qmEBE/</a></p>

<p>I put an existing paragraph element in the body:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Old Text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I define a dataset of 3 numbers and do a .selectAll(“p”)  like this:</p>

<pre><code>var dataset = [10,20,30];

d3.select(""body"").selectAll(""p"")
    .data(dataset)
    .enter()
    .append(""p"")
    .text( function(d){ return(""#""+d); } ) ;
</code></pre>

<p>I get this:</p>

<pre><code>Old Text.
#20
#30
</code></pre>

<p>Two things trouble me:</p>

<p>Why did d3 not create a new p-tag and display the #10?</p>

<p>When I look at the pre-existing paragraph element (“Old Text”), d3 has assigned the d3 data attribute==10.  If d3 captured this p-tag, why not use it to display the datum?</p>

<p>How does d3 decide which pre-existing webpage elements to include in its “update selection”?</p>

<p>BTW—on d3 so far:  I feel liberated by the idea of defining data first and having the design follow.</p>

<p><strong>[ Edited:  So do I have this right?  ]</strong></p>

<p><em>Based on the informative answer from @meetamit…</em></p>

<p>The following creates an update selection inside elements</p>

<pre><code>    elements =d3.select(“body”).selectAll(“p”).data(dataset) 
</code></pre>

<p>The following causes d3 to create an enter selection where p-tags are created for 20 and 30.</p>

<pre><code>    elements.enter() .append(""p"")
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>At this point is the update selection already merged with the enter selection?</p>

<p>The following sets the text in all 3 p-tags because they are all in a merged update selection.</p>

<pre><code>    elements.text(function(d){return(""#""+d);});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>Since d3 will capture existing p-tags, etc from a webpage, is it common practice to make the initial d3.select point to a container that will host the d3 results, like this:</p>

<pre><code>    elements = d3.select(“#myD3Div”)    ….

<p>In Java, if all <code>String</code> objects are internally UTF-16, why can't I pass that <code>String</code> to <code>StringEntity</code> and have it encode it properly?  Of course, I started with the ""quick and dirty"" where I didn't worry about considering multi-byte characters.  For context, in this case I'm making a <code>POST</code> request to SharePoint 2013 systems through it's REST service.</p>

<p><code>StringEntity stringEntity = new StringEntity(mapper.writeValueAsString(requestData),
                        ContentType.create(""application/json;odata=verbose""));</code></p>

<p>From this I received from SharePoint:</p>

<p><code>""System.Text.DecoderFallbackException"",""message"":{""lang"":""en-US"",""value"":""Unable to translate bytes [E5] at index 44 from specified code page to Unicode.""</code></p>

<p>Ok, I wasn't being explicit about the encoding I expect so I changed it to this:</p>

<p><code>StringEntity stringEntity = new StringEntity(mapper.writeValueAsString(requestData),
                        ContentType.create(""application/json;odata=verbose"", ""UTF-8""));</code></p>

<p>I would expect this to take the String I passed in and encode it in UTF-8 on the way out.  However, doing this throws an exception in the HttpClient library:</p>

<p><code>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: MIME type may not contain reserved characters
        at org.apache.http.util.Args.check(Args.java:36)

        at org.apache.http.entity.ContentType.create(ContentType.java:204)
        ...</code></p>

<p>Something it doesn't like about <code>application/json</code> with a <code>UTF-8</code> encoding?  Not sure, so I switched to:</p>

<p><code>ByteArrayEntity byteArrayEntity = new ByteArrayEntity(mapper.writeValueAsString(requestData).getBytes(""UTF-8""),
                        ContentType.create(""application/json;odata=verbose""));</code></p>

<p>which worked.  Now, I didn't try ""round-tripping"" my String to UTF-8 and back and then feeding that to a <code>StringEntity</code>.  I've seen that done and perhaps that would have worked but I would have been left with the same question.  Why?  I must be missing something about encoding and decoding Strings in Java or something about the expectations for the use of these object in HttpClient.  Any help?</p>

One displays two textviews and an editview directly, the next treats the same layout as rows in a list with custom adapter, the third displays a plain list with standard adapter (simple_list_item_1)</p>

<p>The activity uses a standard theme (Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar), which I have not modified. </p>

<p>I would have expected all three blocks to be styled similar. Instead the second block with the custom adapter does not seem to get styled according to the light theme at all. (See screenshot at end of this post)</p>

<p>Ideally I'd like the rows of the custom list to be styled like the first block. Alternatively, I'd like to get the style of the third block applied. However, all of the fonts and backgrounds seem to be some off color and I am not sure how to find out what is currently used as part of the theme. Therefore, fixing the middle block's style by manually assigning text colors, sizes, backgrounds, etc. is not an option.</p>

<p>Here are my unit tests:</p>

<pre><code>TaskInstance taskInstance_1 = new TaskInstance() { Id = 1, Task = task_1 };
IEnumerable&lt;TaskInstance&gt; _domainTaskInstances = new List&lt;TaskInstance&gt;() 
    { taskInstance_1 };

        TaskInstance, bool&gt;&gt;&gt;(), null, """")).Returns(_domainTaskInstances);

    int taskId = 1;
    bool expected = true;
    bool actual;
    actual = GetTarget().CheckForTaskUsage(taskId);
    Assert.AreEqual(expected, actual);
}

[TestMethod()]
public void TaskService_CheckForTaskUsage_Failure()
{
    _taskInstanceRepository.Setup(x =&gt; x.Get(It.IsAny&lt;Expression&lt;Func&lt;
        TaskInstance, bool&gt;&gt;&gt;(), null, """")).Returns(new List&lt;TaskInstance&gt;()
        .AsEnumerable());

    int taskId = 2;
    bool expected = false;
    bool actual;
    actual = GetTarget().CheckForTaskUsage(taskId);
    Assert.AreEqual(expected, actual);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The method that I am checking is this:</p>

<pre><code>public bool CheckForTaskUsage(int taskId)
{
    return _taskInstanceRepository.Get(x =&gt; x.Task.Id == taskId).Any();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The method that I am mocking is this:</p>

<pre><code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; Get(Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, bool&gt;&gt; filter = null, Func&lt;IQueryable&lt;T&gt;, 
    IOrderedQueryable&lt;T&gt;&gt; orderBy = null, string includeProperties = """");
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>GetTarget()</code> method creates an instance of the class where the <code>CheckForTaskUsage()</code> method resides and <code>_taskInstanceRepository</code> is set.</p>

<p>The confusion that I have is down to the <code>.Returns()</code> part of the mocking of the <code>Get()</code> method in the repository. I'm not sure whether setting the return values as I have done is correct as from my point of view it doesn't seem like it will actually execute the <code>Get()</code> method and the expression that is passed into it. However this could be correct as I am not trying to execute the <code>Get()</code> method, only return some values for it, but if that was the case, why would I care about the possible parameters that are sent into it?</p>

<p>Is this possible at all? TortoiseCVS simply says the following, which is rather discouraging:</p>

<p>I <em>finally</em> got somewhere with setting up Git between my localhost (WAMP setup on Windows 8.1) and my Linux server (CentOS 6.6 x64 with cPanel 11.46.2).</p>

<p>Locally I created a bare clone: <code>git clone --bare my_project my_project.git</code></p>

<p>NOTE: my_project is an example name, not the real name, and from this doc here: <a href=""http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Getting-Git-on-a-Server"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Getting-Git-on-a-Server</a></p>

<p>I copied the my_project.git folder to my server's root directory /home/myuser/public_html/</p>

<p>so now in the root directory I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>cgi-bin</li>
<li>my_project.git</li>
</ul>

<p>This is one area I am unsure of. Do I have to do an init (using putty) on my server in the public_html directory? I read something about a bare init? I just want to push (from my PC) the website I already have under Git control, to the server. When I make a change to 1 file, push that change to the server so it's updated live with a push. The website is DONE and ready to be live. I have already manually moved back and forth for live testing on the server. My last step is to get the Git setup correctly, so any further changes I can just push them to the server without the need of FTP.</p>

<p>I added a remote origin: <code>git remote add origin ssh://myuser@thedomain.com/home/myuser/public_html/my_project.git</code></p>

<p>I tried to push to it, and got ""Permission denied (publickey)"". I already had an id_rsa and id_rsa.pub key locally on my PC, so I copied them and renamed them to id_rsa.myname id_rsa.myname.pub (where myname is my first name). I then copied them to the .ssh folder through FTP (FTP as cpanel user, and it's the directory your dumped into, above public_html), same as /home/myuser/.ssh/ directory.</p>

<p>Once they where there, I added them to 'authorized_keys' using Putty logged in as the cpanel user (my private ppk) by doing:</p>

<pre><code>cd .ssh
cat id_rsa.myname &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
cat id_rsa.myname.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre>

<p>After doing that, a push appeared to work. Because I was having a key/auth issue, I used Git Gui version, which was setup and worked fine locally. I added the origins through Git Bash though. When I did ""Remote > Push"" in the Gui version, I got:</p>

<pre><code>Pushing to ssh://theregistrybank@theregistrybank.com/home/theregistrybank/public_html/yiire    gistrybank.git

<p>Before doing the push, the only file modified (diff from the bare clone I transferred to the server) was my .gitignore file. I added 2 more exclusions to it, and committed it locally. So I was trying to push the change in that file. After I did the push, it said ""success"" in green and appeared to work. However, when I check the file in FileZilla, the .gitignore file is not the updated one that I just committed locally.</p>

<p>I think I am close, but missed a step somewhere. I tried to be as descriptive as possible.</p>

<p>And putting the source on GitHub is not an option as the client does not want the source public, and does not want to pay for the private repos. I should be able to push from my local setup to the cPanel server so I don't have to transfer thousands of files every time. I actually transfer a zip file, and unzip on the server lol.</p>

<h2>Server Info</h2>

<ul>
<li>cPanel 11.46.2 build 0</li>

<p>Yes, Git is setup on the server, and working, and git --version reports:git version 1.7.1</p>

<p>Git on my PC: git version 1.9.4.msysgit.2</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<h2>SOLUTION</h2>

<p>Thanks to @VonC I was able to get this to work :)</p>

<p>You need somewhere for your git repo to sit. I created a 'git-repos' folder in '/home/cpaneluser/git-repos' to house my repos for this cpanel user.</p>

<p>First step is to create a bare repo: <a href=""http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Getting-Git-on-a-Server"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Getting-Git-on-a-Server</a> - I only followed the first step, basically created the bare repo 'my-project.git'</p>

<p>Before putting it on your server, rename 'my-project.git/hooks/post-receive.sample' to just 'post-receive' so it will be ran. Edit it with your editor, and add the line that @VonC gave us in his chosen answer:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
umask 0022
GIT_WORK_TREE=/home/cpaneluser/public_html GIT_DIR=/home/cpaneluser/git-repos/my-project.git git checkout -f
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I am using cpanel, so your path's may be different, and your umask could be different. 0022 is for 0644 file permissions. Without the umask, I was getting 500 Internal Server Errors, because the files were created with 0664 permissions instead.</p>

<p>Using FTP or whatever you like, copy the 'my-project.git' bare repo to your server to '/home/cpaneluser/git-repos'. Then go into 'my-project.git/hooks' and change the permissions of post-receive to have execute permissions. For me, 0744 worked fine. This was the magic sauce :)</p>

<p>Locally, add your remote (must be in your git project): git remote set-url origin ssh://cpaneluser@yourdomain.com/home/cpaneluser/git-repos/my-project.git</p>

<p>Now if you try to push now, it won't put the files in 'public_html' because the git tree (terminology?) matches and is up to date. If they are up to date, it seems to skip over executing your 'post-receive' hook. That means your bash script never ran, and it never checked out the files to your working tree.</p>

<p>We need to manually run the 'post-receive' bash script to create all the files of our project in the 'public_html' directory.</p>

<p>cd to '/home/cpaneluser/git-repos/my-project.git/hooks'</p>

<p>Run: <code>./post-receive</code></p>

<p>Boom, all your files are in 'public_html'. Now you can work locally, then push to your cpanel server as expected :)</p>

Obviously, there is no much meaning to $('body') without jQuery, hence we are getting the following error:</p>

I'm stumped.</p>

<p>I get five steps into the process before I get the error:</p>

<p>Error:</p>

<pre><code>arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc: error while loading shared libraries:

</code></pre>

<p>libstdc++.so.6 is present in all three directory trees mentioned in the tutorials as well as ./lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6, but adding the relevant one to the path doesn't help (see below). I suspect there's a library path not being set, but I have no idea what that is.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm doing this in a virtual machine running Ubuntu 13.10 with netbeans and other tools, plus a LAMP stack installed. netbeans will build and run C/C++ executables just fine (and obviously IO can do the same from the command line).</p>

<p>Other things I've tried without success
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/raspberrypi/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian/arm-linux-gnueabihf/lib</p>

<p>Hertaville suggest adding 32 bit architecture:
    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 lib32stdc++6 zlib1g:i386
And the ""build-essential"" package:
    sudo apt-get install build-essential git</p>

<p>Which also didn't help. I've also rebooted just in case.</p>

<p><code>Question</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public String id;
public String text;
public String image;
public ArrayList&lt;Choices&gt; choices;
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p><code>Choices</code>:</p>

<pre><code>boolean isCorrect;
String choice;
</code></pre>

<p>Put simply, I get some XML and parse it. There are Questions and to associate the 3, 4, or 5 answers that may be with a questions, I make an <code>ArrayList&lt;Choices&gt;</code> of all choices (or answers) and then <code>set</code> it into the Question class. But I try to read the list in a particular object, and it returns nothing. </p>

<p>Here's the code where I do the final combinations and testing: </p>

<pre><code>question.setChoices(choiceList);
//Log.d(""demo"", ""&gt;&gt;&gt;"" + question.getChoices());
questionList.add(question);
question = null;
choices = null;
choiceList.clear();
</code></pre>

<p>(LONGER VERSION)</p>

<pre><code>... // other parsing code before this

case XmlPullParser.END_TAG:

            if (parser.getName().equals(""question"")) {

                // Testing purposes
                //Log.d(""demo"", ""&gt;&gt;&gt;"" + choiceList.toString());
                question.setChoices(choiceList);
                //Log.d(""demo"", ""&gt;&gt;&gt;"" + question.getChoices());
                questionList.add(question);
                question = null;
                choices = null;
                choiceList.clear();
                Log.d(""demo"", ""&gt;&gt;&gt;"" + questionList.get(0).getChoices());

            }

            break;

        default:
            break;

        } // END Switch

        event = parser.next();

    } // END While loop

    return questionList;

}

}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, I look at the log and I can print all data in the <code>Question</code> object except for the <code>ArrayList&lt;Choices&gt;</code> information. All I get is <code>[]</code>. I'd greatly appreciate any help with this. </p>

<p>EDITED EXTRA INFO</p>

Upon loading the dll I set the Application handle to the host's main form, which has the effect of keeping my forms and dialogs off of the taskbar. However I would like to show the progress bar on the taskbar and have it stack with the host application. I've googled and searched extensively but can't find anything similar.</p>

<p>Dr. Bob wrote a nice tutorial <a href=""http://www.drbob42.com/examine/examinC5.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> on the various features of the taskbar and from that I've gotten a progress bar showing up in the main application's taskbar button, but I really want to create a second 'stacked' icon for the progress bar, which a lot of applications do. Dr. Bob's example assumes you are part of the main application and uses this code to add a tab:</p>

<pre><code>if not Application.MainFormOnTaskBar then
  FormHandle := Application.Handle
else FormHandle := Application.MainForm.Handle;
TaskbarList.AddTab(FormHandle);
</code></pre>

<p>which doesn't do anything in my case. I've tried </p>

<pre><code>FormHandle := FindWindow('TfmProg', NIL);
TaskbarList.addTab(FormHandle);
</code></pre>

<p>but that doesn't change anything.</p>

<p>I've created the form with Application as the owner, and NIL. I've created it fsNormal or fsStayOnTop. Frankly, I've touched every parameter I can get at, but nothing seems to work.</p>

<p>Any advice?
cheers,</p>

<li>What are these warnings, and why am I getting them?</li>
<li>What do I need to do to get them to go away (fix them)?</li>
<li>Why do I need to include this <code>http</code> library as a dependency if it is a part of the Dart language/core?</li>

<p>Job took 79 seconds</p>

<p>The 500 count for each date is always set to 1. I cannot get it to display the proper count. It seems that the statement <code>$error_count{$ti} = &amp;share({});</code> is the culprit but I'm not sure how to get around it. </p>

<p>That way the View should get to be notified that the underlying property has changed and hence the UI should fetch the new changes.</p>

<p>Did I get the theory right?</p>

<p>The problem I face is that I have an Infragistics DataGrid bound to a ViewModel. As soon as I change a date Value, I can see how the property on the ViewModel is set correctly and the event is raised.  But I haven't subscribed from outside to this event though, how does the UI get notified?</p>

<p>I am asking this because I think the UI is not notofied at all.  I have placed a second textbox that is binding thourgh the ViewModel to the same underlying Model property. However if I modify that property with the DataGrid, the TextBox (Mode=OneWay) is not automatically updated.</p>

<p>I actually make use of MVVM-Light Frame work and use ViewModelBase instead of INotifyPropertyChanged  and do a RaisePropertyChanged(...). But the result should be similar.</p>

<p>Do I have to subscribe the TextBox manually to that Event somehow?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  I have solved the problem, but dont grasp exactly why this is happening. Before answering the Question I need to explain a bit more about the architecture.  The Datgrid is bound to propertyA in ViewModelA that returns an <code>ObservableCollection&lt;ViewModelB&gt;.</code>  ViewModelB actually contains all the properties that the Grid should be displaying.  All these properties fire in their Setters naturally an OnProperyChanged. </p>

<p>The TextBox was bound to PropertyB, that lives also within ViewModelA. But it returns directly a string, so the underlying getter of PerpertyB returns this: </p>

<pre><code>_cashflowInputs[0].ProjectedDate.ToString();
</code></pre>

<p>However if I dont bind the TextBox to this propertyB, but bind it to PropertyA as well, it works:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Its weird. I was expecting it to work the same way. Both Properties live on the same ViewModel and access the same <code>private ObservableCollection&lt;ViewModelB&gt;</code>, why should it matter?</p>

<pre><code>public ObservableCollection&lt;ViewModelB&gt; PropertyA
        {
            get { return _cashflowInputs;}
        }

        public string PropertyB
        {
            get { return _cashflowInputs[0].ProjectedDate.ToString(); }
        }

<pre><code>var attrib = tempAttribute.Options.Where(e =&gt; e.Id == parsedId).Select(e =&gt; e.Name = model.EditRequest.Name);
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I don't do a manual ""expand result"" (like I've done on the image below), it doesn't seem to update the database either.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i54.tinypic.com/311ungn.gif"" alt=""a busy cat""></p>

<p>How is this even possible? It doesn't make much sense to me..</p>

<p>Any help or theories is very appreciated! :-)</p>

<p>The sprite is tiled vertically so the first button is highlighted in the first tile and the second in the next etc.</p>

<p>However I'm also using weebly and am trying to program more and more of it myself to learn, so the navigation code was automatically done thus I'm not sure how to implement it so when a page is selected the button behind is highlighted.</p>

<p>In theory I understand how to do it, I'm just unsure of what functions to use as I'm completely new to CSS. How I would do it is:
  1. Work out which code returns the current webpage as a variable
  2. Calculate the new position for the tiled background by using: (webpage position) * sprite height, or typing out: if webpage = menu sprite_position = 1 * sprite_height</p>

<p>The current code regarding to the navigation is:</p>

<pre><code>#navigation {
  font-family: Ethnocentric, arial, sans-serif;
  position: relative;
  width: 1082px; /*For adjusting the navigation's usable width*/
  height: 29px;
  z-index: 2;
  padding: 11px 0px 0px 45px; /*Fourth argument changes the starting navigation postion*/
  background: url(Ngbck.png) no-repeat;
  _bbbackground: none;
  _fffilter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='files/theme/navigationbg.png', sizingMethod='crop');
}

#navigation ul li {
  float: left;

  text-transform: uppercase;
  padding: 0px;
  margin: 4px 0px 0px 40px;

<p>The home page for it is admittedly too long, and what i'm getting is that the background on my main ""container"" element stops repeating after a certain height, but only in Google Chrome.</p>

<p>You can see it at <a href=""http://www.lejanooriente.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lejanooriente.com</a> (warning: it's a heavy page with a lot of pictures, takes a while to load)</p>

<p>If you let this page load completely and look at it in any browser and in Chrome, you'll see that in ""any"" browser it looks right, and in Chrome something is obviously off. If you scroll all the way to the bottom, it looks right, though.
Try scrolling up, and at one point you'll notice the background ""ends"" (about 30% - 40% from the bottom).</p>

<p>According to FireBug, the element that has the background is 78,472 px tall. It IS way too tall, and in pages that are reasonably long, this effect is not seen.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, this happens in Chrome but not in Safari.</p>

<p>I tried making the background image taller, to try and figure out whether I was getting limited by the height of the element, or the number of times the background got repeated. Changed the image from 30px to 90px tall, and the cutoff is exactly at the same place, so that's not it.</p>

<p>Any ideas what could be going on, or whether there's something I can do to fix it?
(Making the page less long is not an option)</p>

<p>The players current hand is built by binding a list of Card objects to a repeater and then dynamically creating a Card UserControl and adding it to the Controls of a PlaceHolder when each item is databound. The code is roughly as follows:</p>

            &lt;/ItemTemplate&gt;
        &lt;/asp:Repeater&gt;
    &lt;/ContentTemplate&gt;
&lt;/asp:UpdatePanel&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In code behind</p>

<pre><code>protected void rptInHand_ItemDataBound(object sender, RepeaterItemEventArgs e)
{
   Card card = (Card)e.Item.DataItem;
   PlaceHolder plcCard = (PlaceHolder)e.Item.FindControl(""plcInHandCard"");
   plcCard.Controls.Add(CreateCardControl());
}

private CardControl CreateCardControl()
{           
   CardControl cardControl = (CardControl)Page.LoadControl(""~/UserControls/CardControl.ascx"");
   //Set control properties here
   return cardControl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Card Control includes a Button. The ClickEvent for this button calls a Method of the Parent Page that needs to update a seperate UpdatePanel as well as remove the card Control from the Panel that it is sitting within.</p>

<p>I have two issues.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When I click the Card Control Button, because it has been created as part of a repeater within an updatePanel, it no longer exists when the page is posted back and so the Click event for the button within the control never fires. I can obviously rebind the repeater on page load, but does this mean I have to essentially do this on every postback?</p></li>
<li><p>More importantly I need a way to trigger the update of another updatepanel in the parent page when the Card control's click event is raised. Is there a way of setting a trigger on an update panel that listens out for an event within a dynamicaly loaded UserControl?</p></li>

<p>I managed to write 5 times of ""Hello, World"" into a text file. However, when the program runs, it only print out ""Hello,"" for 4 times and the 5th row with ""World"". From my code, isn't it supposed to print out ""Hello, World"" for 5 times? Can somebody please point out where's the error?</p>

<p>Does anyone knows what is this CSS script that executes on load? Could it be the reason why I can't login with curl?</p>

<p>How can I know if it is because I am doing something wrong, or because this method cannot work (as I have read on a few posts on SO.)?</p>

<p>2/Another idea would be to use a tool that manipulates chrome (or any browser) to make it press the different buttons. Does this kind of software exists?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Another way is to convert the docx file to .jpg file which can be directly viewed from the database using picturebox control in .NET. The approach taken was to first convert docx to .mdi and then to .tiff format (using Microsoft Image Writer)  and the converting to jpeg. But this involves several IO operations which reduces the efficiency and reliability of the solution. </p>

<p>Can anybode give me a hint how I can configure <code>DefaultMessageListenerContainer</code> to call <code>session.recover()</code> in case of RuntimeExceptions?</p>

<p>Best regards,<br/>

<p>I've wrote application to test if this true:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Test
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt; values = new Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;();

            values.Add(""apple2"", 2);
            values.Add(""apple3"", 3);
            values.Add(""apple4"", 4);
            values.Add(""apple5"", 5);
            values.Add(""apple6"", 6);
            values.Add(""apple1"", 1);

            var list = new List&lt;int&gt;(values.Values);

            for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.Count; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(list[i]);
            }

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And output is:</p>

<pre><code>2
3
4
5
6
1
</code></pre>

<p>First of all I wonder how is that possible. Isn't Dictionary supposed to use unordered Tree or something like that?</p>

<p>Moreover MSDN states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The order of the values in the <code>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;.ValueCollection</code> is unspecified, but it is the same order as the associated keys in the <code>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;.KeyCollection</code> returned by the Keys property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why MSDN tells that ""order is unspecified"" but implementation happens to keep order? Am I correct that I'm better not to rely on that fact?</p>

<p>Basically, I'm trying to implement a drop down menu into my design. I've been looking around for help coding it, since I'm still relatively new to HTML/CSS and found a few great tutorials that I have altered a bit to match what I have in mind.</p>

<p>The problem I have now is that I don't want my stuff to be scaled what so ever. When the browser is resized, it moves my div holding my drop down menu. This is not how I want my design. Hopefully the description I wrote can help you identify what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>I have read that you can achieve this by using a wrapper div to set the resolution of the site. I have tried doing this, but it breaks my current code, at least the way I'm trying to implement it.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the display that I wish to accomplish:</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>The modal above shows a selection of groups. This selection is the same for each modal, so that works fine, but now I want to disable the input statement in the for loop depending on which button has been pressed to get to this modal. 
I don't know how to create new variables within html. I was hoping that jquery can help with this, so I trigger the modal with the following jquery command</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
   $("".vote"").click(function(){ 
      $('#group_selection').modal('show');
   });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I know that I can use jquary to write values into the html code (as shown here <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10626885/passing-data-to-a-bootstrap-modal"">Passing data to a bootstrap modal</a>) but I don't see how I can use that to make an if selection?<br>
thanks for your help</p>

I would much appreciate if someone could give me a few pointers on how to go about achieving the following
A. send notifications to managers when employee performs certain actions (eg: puts in a leave request)
B. send notifications to employees when leave requests are approved/rejected
C. Some notifications will need to be within the application (as in some kind of bootstrap badge with number of new notifications; outlook or gmail style ""inbox (15)"" ), where as some will need to be sent out as emails or sms. so differentiating type of response to each event is also important</p>

<p>I saw some similar queries here but those seemed to have CometD and Atmosphere etc as suggested solutions.
my questions are 
1. since these notifications may not be in realtime (receive in realtime or near realtime when user is logged in only) do i need websockets etc or would an Ajax style polling be more appropriate?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There could be more than 10,000 employees (hypothetically all logged in at the same time) so will this cause an issue with those many Ajax calls to the server say every 10-15mins (using Spring web mvc to develop this)?</p></li>
<li><p>The way i envisage it in my head is to have the notifications written onto MySQL database with end user info, so that the polling will do a read on the db to check for any new notifications (polling for notification(s) will need to again cause a db write operations to mark as read). </p></li>
<li><p>What to do for someone who doesn't login for a long time and has a backlog of notifications?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Overall this approach seems like too many requests and db read/writes given the potentially large number of users expected.</p>

<p>Can someone please throw some light on a better way to achieve this?</p>

<p>that solution works great when you call the method just once (don't call it from the event window activated). I am creating a gadget and I want the window to always be in the back. if the user clicks on the gadget I don't want it to come to the front which is the default behavior of windows. so what I did in order to solve that problem was to create this event:</p>

<pre><code>    private void Window_Activated(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        SendWpfWindowBack(this);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>so every time the window is activate it call the method founded on the first link that I provided. the problem is that the system tray gets sent to the back. let me show you what I mean.</p>

<h2>that is my gadget on visual studio.</h2>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/MYGBH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>when I run it it get's sent to the back: (I open notepad and outlook to illustrate my point)</h2>

<h2>now when I click on it the event window_Activated fires and it gets send to the back:</h2>

For example, much of our frontend javascript code is written using jQuery and CSS selectors (mostly targeting a CSS ""class""). The problem is, is that many times another developer that is fixing some CSS code will remove a class or will change the DOM element nesting it under another element making the JS code break.</p>

<p>To prevent this, my idea was to use/add a ""data-js"" attribute to each element that we want to use for Javascript. However I am not sure about the performance of a jQuery selector written like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('[data-js=""my_js_selector""]').click();
</code></pre>

<p>Another idea I had, was to add a js-specific class to a dom element that is somehow manipulated by Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""lol.com"" class=""js-link""&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and then calling it simply with <code>$('.js-link').click()</code></p>

<p>It would be very nice that you could only look into HTML and tell that some element has some Javascript manipulations attached without actually looking into the JS code.</p>

<p>Is this a good idea? Or are there some other best practices to separate JS-triggering from CSS styling? </p>

<p>Thanks for your answers!</p>

1. But my main problem is that when i add virtual destructor i get error: ""LNK2001: unresolved external symbol ""public: __thiscall Weapon::~Weapon(void)""

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""width:100px; height:50px; overflow:hidden;""&gt;
&lt;img src=""http://i.guim.co.uk/static/w-620/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/24/1411574454561/03085543-87de-47ab-a4eb-58e7e39d022e-620x372.jpeg"" style=""width:620px; height:320px;""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How would I position the image tag Center-top or left-top</p>

<p>Ok, I uninstalled the versions that I had and reinstalled according to the directions listed below:</p>

<p>I ran:</p>

<pre><code>POSTGIS_SQL_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/postgis15/1.5.3/share/postgis

psql -d template_postgis -c ""GRANT ALL ON geography_columns TO PUBLIC;""
psql -d template_postgis -c ""GRANT ALL ON spatial_ref_sys TO PUBLIC;"" 
</code></pre>

<p>then ran:</p>

<pre><code>$ createdb -T template_postgis newdb
$ createuser --createdb poop
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) y
</code></pre>

<p>Now Here is what I get for my db list:</p>

<pre><code>$ psql -l

<p>Making sure my version is correct:</p>

<pre><code>$ psql newdb
psql (9.0.8)
Type ""help"" for help.

                                       postgis_full_version

</code></pre>

<p>It looks like all dependencies are taken care of and the database looks happy, everything looks clean! (However, where is the geograph_colums I grated all users access to above?)</p>

<p>Now, settings.py:</p>

<pre><code>DATABASES = {
    'default': {
         'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
         'NAME': 'newdb',
         'USER': 'poop', # yes, I named my user poop
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>now when I run:</p>

<pre><code>$ python manage.py syncdb
</code></pre>

<p>I get a link through of various files ending with:</p>

<pre><code>psycopg2.OperationalError: could not connect to server: Permission denied
Is the server running locally and accepting
connections on Unix domain socket ""/var/pgsql_socket/.s.PGSQL.5432""?
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously my db is running because I can psql into it. However are permissions set up incorrectly?</p>

<p>pg_hba.conf:</p>

<pre><code># TYPE  DATABASE        USER            CIDR-ADDRESS            METHOD

<p>To do this, I would like to utilize D3's tree layout to load and draw nodes. This API can return all elements of a given type. The children of those elements, however, are accessed via a reference URL, rather than a nested array.</p>

<p>In setting up my tree in D3, I am attempting to set a child accessor function that uses d3.json() to return all children for a given node using this URL. Here is my tree builder function thus far, where <code>root</code> is a top-level item with a <code>Children</code> attribute:</p>

<pre><code>function buildTreeFor(root) {
    var tree = d3.layout.tree();
    tree.children(function(node) {
        d3.json(node.Children._ref, function(data) {
            return data;
        });
    });
    var nodes = tree.nodes(root);
    var links = tree.links(nodes);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As one would expect, these links are empty, and the nodes do not reference the discovered children. After reading the D3 documentation and some tutorials, I'm at a loss for a pattern here. I could return the child data in a Promise, but where would it be resolved? Somewhere in the node resolution process behind the scenes?</p>

<p>I need to ensure that all levels of this hierarchy are represented in the final diagram. What can I do to wait for the resolution of these AJAX calls?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Binding on event to the form1, and include this on document ready.  </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt; jQuery(document).ready(
&gt;       function () {

&gt;       });

<p>Binding on event to the document itself - </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>jQuery(document).on(""click"", ""input[type='text']"" ,function () {
            this.select();
        });</p>

"25209457","1","","","2014-08-08 17:56:09","","0","224","<p>I have this custom tab control and it works perfectly so far except for one thing. That tab control allows users to un-dock tabs as windows and re-dock tabs. The tab un-docks fine, but when the user re-docks it, it adds the item, but doesn't show that it is selected. </p>

<p>Here is the code for re-docking....</p>

<pre><code>//find window
        DependencyObject window = sender as UIElement;
        while (!(window is Window) &amp;&amp; window != null)
        {
            window = VisualTreeHelper.GetParent(window);
        }
        Window currentWindow = window as Window;

        //redock window
        if (CurrentTabControl != null)
        {
            TabItem tab = new TabItem();

            //add header text
            tab.Header = currentWindow.Title;

            //add frame to tab
            tab.Content = currentWindow.Content;

            //add tab to tab control
            CurrentTabControl.Items.Add(tab);

            //select tab
            CurrentTabControl.SelectedItem = tab;
        }

        //close window
        currentWindow.Close();
</code></pre>

<p>Now, to the tab control this item is in fact docked. It calls the selection changed event on the tab control. But the the ui doesn't change for some reason. The other item is still selected in that way. I don't know if I can do a refresh on that or what but it's being pretty weird.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>/////EDIT///////</p>

<p>So the first piece of code is being called from a button on a custom window that I made. I don't know if that has anything to so with it. I also have a method that adds pages to the tab control and that works fine. Here it is...</p>

<pre><code>public Tuple&lt;TabItem, Page&gt; AddNewPage(Type pageType, string header)
    {
        //create new tab
        TabItem tab = new TabItem();

        //add header text
        tab.Header = header;

        //create new frame
        Frame frame = new Frame();

        //create new Page
        Page page = (Page)Activator.CreateInstance(pageType);

        //navigate to page
        frame.Navigate(page);

        //add frame to tab
        tab.Content = frame;

        //add tab to tab control
        CurrentTabControl.Items.Add(tab);

        //select tab
        CurrentTabControl.SelectedItem = tab;

        return new Tuple&lt;TabItem, Page&gt;(tab, page);
    }  
</code></pre>

<p>/////SOLUTION//////
Apparently I needed to select that tab after the window was closed. So I just reorganized the code a bit and it works! </p>

<pre><code>//find window
        DependencyObject window = sender as UIElement;
        while (!(window is Window) &amp;&amp; window != null)
        {
            window = VisualTreeHelper.GetParent(window);
        }
        Window currentWindow = window as Window;

        TabItem tab = new TabItem();

        //add header text
        tab.Header = currentWindow.Title;

        //add frame to tab
        tab.Content = currentWindow.Content;

        //close window
        currentWindow.Close();

        //redock window
        if (CurrentTabControl != null)
        {
            //add tab to tab control
            CurrentTabControl.Items.Add(tab);

            //select tab

At random, the page can load the view of another user even when I did not log out of my session. Without doing anything else, another refresh will bring me back to my own account (at random too). </p>

<p>This phenomenon is happening to two of our web applications coded by two separate users following the Passport guides on their website. Both web apps use Facebook connect/API.</p>

<p>This happens on both Redis and File session stores. I saw <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10509187/2-concurrent-requests-getting-mixed-up-in-node-js-app"">a post about using global variables</a>: we are sure we use local scope only. </p>

<p>Is there something that we are doing wrong?</p>

<h3>Update v1</h3>

<p>On one app, we implemented the following for the serialize/deserialize for Passport:</p>

<pre><code>passport.serializeUser(function(user, done) {
    done(null, user);
});

passport.deserializeUser(function(obj, done) {
    done(null, obj);
});
</code></pre>

<p>The other, we have also tried:</p>

<pre><code>passport.serializeUser(function (user, done) {
  done(null, user);
});

passport.deserializeUser(function(user, done) {
  User
    .where({id: user.id})
    .fetch()
    .then(function (user) {
      done(null, user);
    }, function (err) {
      done(err, user);
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Either way, the app stills have its session mixed up.</p>

<p><strong>Update v2</strong>
This error only happens when multiple users are logged in to the server and are using concurrently. It does not occur when only 1 person is using the system.</p>

<p><strong>Update v3</strong>
It seems that the problem might be caused by Amazon AWS since some of the ""wrong user"" page requests are not reaching the NodeJS app at all (verified by <code>console.log</code>).</p>

<p>I cannot find the correct way to define the two template specializations of the operator++() for the PREORDER and POSTORDER type. </p>

<p>If I use the <code>template&lt;&gt;</code> keyword, the compiler complains that the specialization is done out of scope and I do not understand why.
Moving the two template specializations out of the GenericTree class body didn't solve the problem.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your help!</p>

My problem is in understanding when/where I should create these threads and when they get terminated.  Currently, I am creating them in the OnCreate() of the main UI Activity.  But, this is causing havok, as I recently needed to ""jump"" from one Activity back to the Main activity.  The recommendation was to use an Intent and StartActivity() with the appropriate flags to ""clear to top"".  But, this of course causes a whole new set of instances for my threads, and everything unravels.  Should I be using a Service, tied to my UI somehow?

<p>yes, i think that the problem resigns in the fact that my certificates are for apache http. I found this tutorial <br/> <a href=""http://wiki.eclipse.org/Generating_a_Private_Key_and_a_Keystore"">http://wiki.eclipse.org/Generating_a_Private_Key_and_a_Keystore</a> <br/> that explains how to convert these certificates, but this does not seems to solve my problem eighter</p>

<p>That's the html code.  The two images are supposed to appear next to each other on the same line without any white space in between them.  My CSS is such that there is no margin or padding between those two inline images.  Yet 3 pixels of white space appears between the two images.</p>

<p>Now, when I remove the line break in the HTML file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""head-ads""&gt;

<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=UTF-8""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Any thoughts on why the line break in the HTML code adds three pixels of white space between the images when viewed in browser?  This has been observed in FireFox and Chrome on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>These files are part of a WordPress theme.  But it was a theme I created from scratch, so the HTML and CSS is 100% known by me.  It's very simple.  I don't know if the PHP or WordPress is doing something weird.  But my understanding of HTML tells me that adding the line break in the code shouldn't add white space in the browser.</p>

"16992266","1","","","2013-06-07 20:14:58","","0","67","<p>I recently asked a question about triggering dynamically created divs, and was introduced to the .on() function.</p>

<p>'keyup' works great, 'mouseover' works, a few others I've tested work but 'click' just will not fire.</p>

<p>I created added information to a div via ajax and .php which holds some data like this:</p>

<pre><code>function loadNewcomment(divID) {
$.ajax({
        url: templateUrl+""/enternote.php"",
        cache: false,
        success: function(html){
            $(""#""+divID).append(html);

        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>I wanted to trigger on keyup for an element within that created div and this code works for that:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#notebox"").on('keyup', '.note-field', function(event){
    var thisString = $(this).val();
    $keyLength = thisString.length;
    $rowCount = Math.ceil($keyLength/40);
    $currentRow = $(this).attr(""rows"");

    if($currentRow &lt; $rowCount){
        $(this).animate({rows:$rowCount},50);
    }        

});
</code></pre>

<p>This code however does NOT work:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#notebox"").on('click', '.note-field', function() {
    alert(""clicked"");

<p>I have a bunch of functions which I now want to put into a service and inject this into my controllers.
Generally, is there a good way to do so and how?</p>

<p>For example, I have a datepicker which as a default date set as of two weeks from today. I solved this in the controller like </p>

<pre><code>$scope.dt=function(){
          $scope.dt=new Date();
          $scope.numberOfDaysToAdd=14;
          $scope.dt=$scope.dt.setDate($scope.dt.getDate()+$scope.numberOfDaysToAdd);
</code></pre>

<p>whereas in my html <code>ng-model='dt'</code>.
I now want to take this logic and put it in a service. I thought about using a factory and I did something like this:</p>

<pre><code>app.factory('Datepicker',[function(){

    var numberOfDaysToAdd=14;
    var addDays=new Date();
    addDays.daysToAdd=function(){
        addDays = addDays.setDate(addDays.getDate()+numberOfDaysToAdd);
        return addDays;
    };
    return addDays;
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>and in the controller </p>

<pre><code> $scope.dt = function(){
      addDays.daysToAdd()
  };
</code></pre>

                            group myData by (int) myData.TimeStamp.TimeOfDay.TotalMinutes / 60 into barData

</code></pre>

<p>which returns an <code>IEnumerable&lt;Bar&gt;</code> where bars are grouped into 60 minute bars. This works fine as long as the original <code>bars</code> collection contains bars of only one and the same day timestamp. If the source collection contains multiple days then all bars are grouped into a maximum of 24 hourly buckets. </p>

<p>How can I adjust the code so that the collection is first grouped by <code>Date</code> and then grouped by <code>TotalMinutes /60</code> (such as above) in order to end up with 60 minute buckets separately for each date? </p>

<p>I generalized the query somewhat, could someone comment whether that is the correct approach or am I missing something obvious? </p>

</code></pre>

<p>Now, when hovering the mouse over the blue/red intersection I'd like to detect mouse events on both those elements, and the same for the blue/orange combo. As you can see in the logs, in those cases the event is currently only fired for the blue box as it is on top.</p>

<p>This has to do with pointer-events, as I can get the red and orange elements to fire the event while hovering the blue element by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3680429/click-through-a-div-to-underlying-elements"">setting the blue element's pointer-events to none</a>. But then I don't get the events for the blue box, so that is not a viable option either.</p>

<p>I will use whichever library solves this problem. I looked at event bubbling like in <a href=""http://bl.ocks.org/vicapow/6955981"" rel=""nofollow"">this d3 example</a>, but that only works for elements that are nested in the DOM. I have lots of independent elements that may overlap with lots of other elements and can therefore not structure my DOM that way.</p>

<p>I'm guessing the last resort is to find the elements that are at the current mouse position, and manually firing the events. Therefore, I looked at <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/elementFromPoint"" rel=""nofollow"">document.elementFromPoint()</a>, but that would only yield 1 element (and may not work in SVG?). I found the <a href=""http://jquerypp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuerypp</a> function <a href=""http://jquerypp.com/#within"" rel=""nofollow"">within</a>, that finds the elements at a given position, see <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/donejs/akSQD/light/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. That example looks great, except it's DIVs and not inside SVG. When replacing divs with svg rectangle elements, the fiddle seems to <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/michaschwab/akSQD/40/"" rel=""nofollow"">break</a>.</p>

Since many touch devices like the iPad don't provide a way to do a right click on a website this would be very handy because a website's code doesn't need to be adjusted.</p>

<p>The goal is to translate a long tap event to the right click event without modifying the code. (Just loading some JavaScript, of course.)</p>

<p>If've seen that <a href=""https://github.com/furf/jquery-ui-touch-punch/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/furf/jquery-ui-touch-punch/</a> does something similar for drag'n'drop support on jQuery widgets. However this plugin doesn't support the long tap. </p>

<p>Also <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-for-ipad-and-iphone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-for-ipad-and-iphone/</a> does actually perform the desired translation but it brakes scrolling, thus making it useless for regular websites with the need of scroll support.</p>

My first attempt of course was to attempt to optimise the std::ifstream buffer and found some interesting results.</p>

<p>1- My parsing method's read sizes are exclusively 4 and 80 bytes, I use read() not formatted input, so I tried buffer sizes from 128 bytes up to 1M. I was surprised to find that 128 bytes gives the best result. Even 64 bytes buffer size was almost identical to 128 in performance.
I don't get it how is 128 clearly better than say 4K, nor how is 64 byte, which is less than my single read operation perform so good compared to 4K or even 512 bytes.</p>

<p>2- More interesting is this, the 128 byte buffer parsed the file in around 14 seconds, the immediate subsequent run took 4s, next 1.5s then it settled around 0.7s!</p>

<p>Now if I run another file then retry the first one, it goes back to 14 and decreases again.
I checked with multiple test files, same results: subsequent runs on same input takes much less time.</p>

<p>How is this possible? and how is it even possible to parse a 1GB in 0.7s?
And it's not some weird bug, tests pass.</p>

<p>Can it be that the OS caches the entire file in memory?</p>

<p>My system is OSX 10.9.5 with 8GB RAM, xcode 5.1.1, Apple LLVM 5.1 (clang)</p>

<p>P.S. I didn't post code as it is too big, I will try to reproduce it with sample code.</p>

<p>P.S.S. Respect to he who deduces what the application does from these numbers :)</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong></p>

<p>As added info, the application performs around 250,000 read operation, a handful of memory allocation and some calculations that are mostly strait forward.</p>

<pre><code>const string CertWithoutPrivateKey = ""MII...."";

public static SecurityToken GetSigningToken(bool includePrivateKey)
{
    X509Certificate2 cert = null;

<p>The code needs to be able to get the cert with the private key. The Saml2AuthenticationModule (from the WIF Extension for the SAML 2.0 Protocol) relies on this private key to decrypt information sent from a SAML Identity Provider. </p>

<p>I don't know much about certificates or encryption, but it seems to me that hard-coding the certificate into a class is not secure. </p>

<p><strong>So, how should my code go about retrieving the cert with private key?</strong> Afaik, this code is only run one time at app startup (so probably also after an app pool recycle). </p>

<p>I could:</p>

<ol>
<li>Store the cert as an appSetting in config file. As long as appSettings are config encrypted, is this secure?</li>
<li>Store the cert in a database. </li>
<li>Store the cert as a file in bin/App_Data. Afaik this means it could not be read over the web, but would be in plain view to anyone who can access the host server. Imo if someone can get into my server, letting them read this cert is probably the least of my worries. </li>
</ol>

<p>Are there any other options? What is most appropriate in this case?</p>

One way is to define a global variable for such an item every 15 seconds. This global variable needs to be the same across all sessions on this website.

I'm stuck at 2) due to 2 problems, here's what I have:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Form1.cs</code> is where I manage the UI and start a BackgroundWorker
that runs the <code>Logic.cs</code>'s main function</li>
<li><code>DependencyMapper.cs</code> is... well, where I do the folders/files thing (in Fetch()) and call a Form1 function that populates each line (the current file's name) into a Form1's textbox using BeginInvoke.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Less talk and more code.</strong> This is the skinny, awfully working version of my code:</p>

<p><code>Form1.cs</code></p>

<pre><code>public partial class Form1 : Form
{
    public DependencyMapper dep;
    BackgroundWorker bwDep;

    public Form1()
    {
        // I read here in SO to try put the BW stuff here don't know why, but hasn't helped.
        InitializeComponent();

        bwDep = new BackgroundWorker();
        bwDep.DoWork += bwDep_DoWork;
        bwDep.RunWorkerCompleted += bwDep_RunWorkerCompleted;
    }

    private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
            bwDep.RunWorkerAsync();
    }
    void bwDep_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
    {
        dep.Fetch(extensions);
    }
    public void SendBack(string msg) // To receive Fetch()s progress
    {
        textBox2.BeginInvoke(new Action(() =&gt;
        {
            textBox2.Text += msg + ""\r\n"";
            textBox2.SelectionStart = textBox2.Text.Length;
            textBox2.ScrollToCaret();
        }));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>DependencyMapper.cs</code></p>

<pre><code>public class DependencyMapper
{
    private Form1 form;
    public DependencyMapper(Form1 form1)
    {
        this.form = form1;
    }
    public void Fetch()
    {
        DirectoryInfo folder = new DirectoryInfo(form.Texto1);
        FileInfo[] files = folder.GetFiles(""*.*"", SearchOption.AllDirectories);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; files.Length; i++)
        {
            form.SendBack(files[i].FullName); // Kind of talking back to the UI through form's reference and SendBack method which uses BeginInvoke.
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, does my app work? Yes, but two huge problems I can't solve:</p>

<ol>
<li>It freezes the UI (wtf lazy BackgroundWorker?). Not completely because the textbox is adding each file one by one but like it's supposed to but I can't move the window around or click any buttons.</li>
<li>It's veeery slow. Definately I'm doing something wrong. My app currently fills the textbox at a rate of 10 files per second approx. And i'm coding it to find particular snippets of text in hundreds of files...omg</li>
</ol>

<p>PS: Before using BackgroundWorker I was using Thread: the UI didn't freeze at all but the textbox populating ratio was as slow. That's why I decided to venture with BackgroundWorker which only brought problem #1.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Now if my OutdateDuplicateUsers throws an exception, I would still end up with the accounts that Save method persisted. I do not want that to happen.
I want both Save and OutdateDuplicateUsers method to be atomic. I read about <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/690136/All-About-TransactionScope"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> great article about TransactionScope and seemed it is exactly what I want. However, I could not get it to work. The implementation seems straight forward reading from the article, but I couldn't get it working myself.</p>

<p>What I tried:</p>

<pre><code>void Processor(Input input)

    var mapper = new Mapper(recordDetails);
    int remainingRecords = GetCountForRemainingRecords(recordDetails);
    try
    {
        while (remainingRecords &gt; 0)
        {
            using (var scope = new TransactionScope())
            {
                try
                {
                    mapper.CreateRecords(dataset);
                    Validate(dataset);
                    //the method Save(dataset) is using SqlBulkCopy; maps tables, uses transaction, and saves it..
                    Save(dataset);
                    //I cannot perform this opertaion on the dataset directly because dataset doesn't have the records that is in the database
                    //the method below eventually calls a stored proc that sends a list of users that was recently created

                    remainingRecords = MethodToGetUpdatedCount();
                    scope.Complete();
                }
                catch (Exception)
                {
                    //not both at the same time. I tried using both, one at a time though.

<p>update:
The dataset is a strongly typed dataset and is schema only. The CreateRecords and Validate method populates the data based on the business logic. The 'mapper' takes in recordDetails which is, for instance, a list of Users (updated the snippet).
What I mean by doesn't work is that if OutdateDuplicateUser() method throws an exception and cannot complete the outdating operation, I could still see that the records have been persisted in the database from Save(dataset) method, which I am trying to prevent.</p>

<p>Part of its ugliness stems from the fact that I needed a way to associate <code>char</code>acters to <code>int</code>egers ('0'->0, '1'->1, ..., '9'->9) and made an array or structs</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct icpair
{
    char cval;
    int ival;
} icpair;

icpair decmap [10] = {{'0',0}, {'1',1}, {'2',2}, {'3',3}, {'4',4}, {'5',5}, {'6',6}, {'7',7}, {'8',8}, {'9',9}};
int decmapLength = sizeof(decmap)/sizeof(icpair);
</code></pre>

<p>for that purpose. But, looking up a value, if it even exists, accounts for the unsightly number of lines that could be condensed if there was a better way to do this in pure C. I also want this to be reliable, so no ASCII value subtraction like <code>'9'-'ch'</code>. Is this possible in pure C, and if so, how is it implemented?</p>

<p>This is what I'm assuming for inserting:</p>

<pre><code>collection.insert({}, function(err,insertedDocuments){

<p>However for insertedDocuments I expect them to be the actual documents, but this is what insertedDocuments is always looking like:</p>

<pre><code>{""ok"":1,""n"":1}
</code></pre>

<p>The important code to explain what I'm doing is:</p>

<pre><code>var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
var ObjectID = require('mongodb').ObjectID;

MongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/places', function (err, db) {

  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(""Connected to database ... Will work with default places collection"".inverse);
  places = db.collection('places');
  strings = db.collection('strings');

  app.route('/places').post(newPlaceController);

  app.listen(6190, function() {
    console.log('Express listening'.inverse);
  });
});

function newPlaceController (request,response) {

  console.log(request.body);
  var latitude = request.body.lat;
  var longitude = request.body.long;
  var name = request.body.name;

  var newPlace = getNewPlaceObject(name,latitude,longitude);  // This returns the object/document to be inserted

  places.insert(newPlace, function (err,createdPlace) {

    if (err)
      response.send(JSON.stringify(err),500);

      console.log(createdPlace);
      response.send(JSON.stringify(createdPlace),200);

<p>I first followed this tutorial <a href=""http://www.tdd-django-tutorial.com/tutorial/1/"">http://www.tdd-django-tutorial.com/tutorial/1/</a> and used fixtures and dumpdata to make the admin account info available for the testing app (which creates a new database). This works fine.</p>

<p>I then wanted to see if I can do the same using <a href=""https://github.com/rbarrois/factory_boy"">factory-boy</a> to replace the fixtures. Factory boy works by instantiating the necessary object within the tests.py file which seems cleaner to me. Somehow I can't get this to work and the Factory_boy documentation is not too helpful...</p>

<p>Here is my tests.py</p>

<pre><code>from django.test import LiveServerTestCase
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import factory

class UserFactory(factory.Factory):
    FACTORY_FOR = User

    username = 'jeff'
    password = 'pass'
    is_superuser = True

class AdminTest(LiveServerTestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.browser = webdriver.Firefox()

    def tearDown(self):
        self.browser.quit()

    def test_if_admin_login_is_possible(self):
        jeff = UserFactory.create()

        # Jeff opens the browser and goes to the admin page
        self.browser = webdriver.Firefox()
        self.browser.get(self.live_server_url + '/admin/')

        # Jeff sees the familiar 'Django Administration' heading
        body = self.browser.find_element_by_tag_name('body')
        self.assertIn('Django administration', body.text)

        # Jeff types in his username and password and hits return
        username_field = self.browser.find_element_by_name('username')
        username_field.send_keys(jeff.username)
        password_field = self.browser.find_element_by_name('password')
        password_field.send_keys(jeff.password)
        password_field.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)

        # Jeff finds himself on the 'Site Administration' page

        self.assertIn('Site administration', body.text)

        self.fail('Fail...')
</code></pre>

<p>This fails to log in as somehow it doesn't create a valid admin account. How can I do that using factory-boy? Is it possible or do I need to use fixtures for that? </p>

<p>but when I display the above on screen, I get a weird plus sign that has a circle around it. I am using the variable in an app that I'm making so using android may have something to do with the strange format. Is this how the plus sign is supposed to look or is there a way to make it look like a normal plus(a cross with no circle)?</p>

<p>Let me add some alternatives I've tried. The first thing I did was see if the unicode version of the plus sign would look any different but nothing appeared when I displayed it(the code was \u002B). I, also, looked at the ascii version but I wasn't sure how to convert it to a string.</p>

<p>Here is the code I use to display the string onScreen</p>

<pre><code> Addition = new Text(PositionX, PositionY, standardFont, ""Intergers"" + plusSign + ""Integers"");

<p>I'm creating a turn-based tile game in 3D space using Unity. The levels will have slopes, occasional non-planar geometry, depressions, tunnels, stairs etc. Each level is static/handcrafted so tiles should never move. <strong>I need a good way to keep track of tile-specific variables for static levels and i'd like to verify if my approaches make sense</strong>.</p>

<p>My ideas are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create 2 Meshes - 1 is the complex game world, the second is a reference mesh overlay that will have minimal geometry; it will not be rendered and will only be used for the tiles. I would then Overlay the two and use the 2nd mesh as a grid reference.</li>
<li>Hard-code the tiles for each level. While tedious it will work as a brute force approach. I would, however, like to avoid this since it's not very easy to deal with visually.</li>
<li>Workaround approach - Convert the 3d to 2D textures and only use 1 mesh.</li>
<li>""Project"" a plane down onto the level and record height/slope to minimize complexity. Also not ideal.</li>
<li>Create individual tile objects for each tile manually (non-rendered). Easiest solution i could think of.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now for the <strong>Unity3D specific question</strong>:
Does unity allow selecting and assigning individual Verts/Triangles/Squares of a mesh and adding componenets, scripts, or variables to those selections; for example, selecting 1 square in the 10x10 unity plane and telling unity the square of that plane now has a new boolean attached to it? This question mostly refers to idea #1 above, where i would use a reference mesh for positional and variable information that were directly assigned to the mesh. I have a feeling that if i do choose to have a reference mesh, i'd need to have the tiles be individual objects, snap them in place using the reference, then attach relevant scripts to those tiles.</p>

<p>I have found a ton of excellent resources (like <a href=""http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/gameprog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/gameprog.html</a>) on tile generation (mostly procedural), i'm a bit stuck on the basics due to being new to unity and im not looking for procedural design.</p>

<p>Within <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> I have</p>

<pre><code>let label = cell.viewWithTag(1) as! UILabel
label.backgroundColor = yellowColor // yellowColor is a regular UIColor I defined elsewhere
println(label.backgroundColor) // returns Optional(UIDeviceRGBColorSpace 0.980392 0.776471 0 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, within <code>prepareForSegue</code> I have</p>

<pre><code>let cell = tableView.cellForRowAtIndexPath(tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow()!)
let labelBackgroundColor = cell?.viewWithTag(1) as! UILabel).backgroundColor
println(labelBackgroundColor) // returns Optional(UIDeviceWhiteColorSpace 0 0)

<p>Therefore I'm getting <code>Optional(UIDeviceRGBColorSpace 0.980392 0.776471 0 1)</code> and <code>Optional(UIDeviceWhiteColorSpace 0 0)</code> from the same label's backgroundColor property according to my understanding. Shouldn't it be the same RGB value? What am I missing here? If this is the wrong way to access the label's backgroundColor property, how would I go about accessing it properly?</p>

<p>Notice the difference in <strong>width</strong> between the two Editors/iframes, the editor which causes the issues is the one with <strong>width: 0px</strong>, somehow when you resize the browser or Editor it changes the <strong>width</strong> back to <strong>704px</strong>.</p>

<p>I have an array of numbers and I managed to get the list of unique values with number of occurrences and percentage in an object (the unique number as the key, occurrences, percentage and the progressive percentage as the values). Example:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.values = {""17"" : [1, 0.02, 0.02],""18"" : [6, 0.12, 0.14],""19"" : [7, 0.14, 0.28],""20"" : [9, 0.18, 0.46],""21"" : [13, 0.26, 0.72], ""22"" : [4, 0.08, 0.8],""23"" : [5, 0.1, 0.9],""24"" : [1, 0.02, 0.92],""25"" : [3, 0.06, 0.98],""26"" : [1, 0.02, 1]}
</code></pre>

<p>The unique number is the key while the 3 values are respectively the number of occurrences, the percentage on the overall iterations and the progressive percentage. Example, the number 25 occurred 3 times, i.e. 6% of the times, and includes 98% of the occurrences of numbers smaller or equal to 25.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
Given a ""progressive percentage"" I need to get the key of the nearest value to that percentage. So, the search must be performed only on the 3rd values (if that changes anything), should identify the closest value (select the greater of two equidistant values), should return the <strong>key</strong>.</p>

<p>In the example above:</p>

<ul>
<li>if I search for 0.75, I should get 21,</li>
<li>if I search for 0.91, I should get 23.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any help with this?</p>

<p>This is where I got so far:</p>

<pre><code>function nearest(num, ar) {
        var i = 0,
            closest, closestDiff, currentDiff;
        for (i; i &lt; ar.length; i++) {
            if (closest) {
                closestDiff = Math.abs(num - closest);
                currentDiff = Math.abs(num - ar[i]);
                if (currentDiff &lt; closestDiff) {
                    closest = ar[i];
                }
                closestDiff = null;
                currentDiff = null;
            } else if (!closest) {
                //give initial value
                closest = ar[i];
            }
        }
function (pct) {
    $scope.milestones = [];
    var ms = $scope.getClosestNum(pct, $scope.values);
    $scope.milestones.push(ms);
    return $scope.milestones;
  };

<p>""ruta"" is instanced in the onCreate() method, this way:</p>

<pre><code>ruta=new PolylineOptions();
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works fine for the first time. But, there are ImageViews to swap between walking route and driving route. These are the listeners:</p>

<pre><code>ImageView rutacoche=(ImageView) findViewById(R.id.botonrutacoche);
    rutacoche.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {

        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {


            tiporuta=""driving"";
            mapa.clear();//also tried doing polygon.remove()
            if(origen!=null){
                continuar(origen);
            }else{
                continuar(new LatLng(lastKnownLocation.getLatitude(), lastKnownLocation.getLongitude()));
            }

        }
    });

    ImageView rutawalk=(ImageView) findViewById(R.id.botonrutawalk);
    rutawalk.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {

        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {


            tiporuta=""walking"";
            mapa.clear();//also tried doing polygon.remove()
            if(origen!=null){
                continuar(origen);
            }else{
                continuar(new LatLng(lastKnownLocation.getLatitude(), lastKnownLocation.getLongitude()));
            }

        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the first time I do is mapa.clear(); mapa is instanciated this way:</p>

<pre><code>GoogleMap mapa = ((SupportMapFragment) getSupportFragmentManager()
            .findFragmentById(R.id.map)).getMap();
</code></pre>

<p>So, if documentation is correct, it should remove all polylines, markers, etc. but, when i click on the images to swap route types, the previous route is not removed. And, by selecting the walking route, it draws a straight line over buildings, rivers, etc. My question is, why the mapa.clear() call is not working? And, why the route is displayed perfectly the first time, but second and following times are drawn incorrectly?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>(PD: Im not sure I have explained everything ok, it's maybe a bit confusing, if you need clarification please ask).</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Just to ilustrate what I say, this is the polyline the first time it is drawn: <a href=""http://imageshack.us/a/img199/5575/screenshot201304151239.png"" rel=""nofollow"">Polyline ok</a> and this is the next times that is drawn: <a href=""http://imageshack.us/a/img820/554/screenshot201304151240.png"" rel=""nofollow"">Polyline not ok</a></p>

<p>Now, I can see some logic in this. But I'd really like to grasp the workings behind the problem.
I mean, it seems reasonable that the compiler checks whether a variable is initialized if it sees you're doing something with it in your code, but I don't think I'm doing anything that NEEDS the variable to be initialized.</p>

<p>According to sources like <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13972617/primitives-objects-declaration-default-initialization-values"">this</a> when I simply declare my String (or any other Object) variable ""name"", it already points to null. Then why is it considered an anomaly to simply check if that value is null? Will the compiler consider an error anything that I do to my uninitialized variable other than assignments?</p>

<p><a href=""https://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-2851"">https://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-2851</a></p>

<p>I am working on a <code>ContainerRequestFilter</code> using Jersey 2.15.  This is an embedded Jetty app which is shaded into a single jar.</p>

<p>In the Jetty starter (main class):</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    ServletContextHandler context = new ServletContextHandler(ServletContextHandler.SESSIONS);
    context.setContextPath(""/"");
    Server jettyServer = new Server(10005);
    jettyServer.setHandler(context);
    ServletHolder jerseyServlet = context.addServlet(ServletContainer.class, ""/*"");
    jerseyServlet.setInitOrder(0);
    jerseyServlet.setInitParameter(ServerProperties.PROVIDER_PACKAGES, ServletConstants.COMPONENT_SCAN_ROOT);

    try {
        System.out.println(""Starting Jetty"");
        jettyServer.start();

        e.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
        jettyServer.destroy();
    }

<p>I have a filter which is included via a provider</p>

<pre><code>@Provider
public class ExampleProvider implements DynamicFeature {

    @Override
    public void configure(ResourceInfo resourceInfo, FeatureContext featureContext) {
        ExampleFilter exampleFilter = new ExampleFilter();
        featureContext.register(exampleFilter);
    }
}

<p>Then in the filter:</p>

<pre><code>public class ExampleFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ExampleFilter.class);

    @Context
    private HttpServletRequest servletRequest;

    @Override
    public void filter(ContainerRequestContext containerRequestContext) throws IOException {
        logger.info(""IP ADDRESS "" + servletRequest.getRemoteAddr());
        // ...
    }

}

First i tried the link given <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12400504/selecting-contact-from-autocomplete-textview"">here</a> but the problem was everything was happening in the UI thread, hence my UI thread would freeze for like 10 seconds.</p>

<p>I saw many examples but all happen in the UI thread.</p>

<p>Then after googling a lot i came to the concept of cursoradapter and found a very good project given <a href=""https://github.com/robertjli/android-contacts-edit-text"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> but the problem is this example uses <code>Contacts.CONTENT_URI</code> and i cant get the Phone number associated with each contact.
I tried changing the uri to <code>ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone</code> but it didn't work.</p>

<p>Then i modified the getitem method as follows:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public Object getItem(int position) {
    Cursor cursor = (Cursor) super.getItem(position);
    Contact contact = new Contact();

    String imageUri = cursor
            .getString(ContactsQuery.PHOTO_THUMBNAIL_DATA_COLUMN);
    Bitmap bitmap = loadContactPhotoThumbnail(imageUri,
            mDropdownItemHeight);
    if (bitmap == null) {
        bitmap = mLoadingImage;
    }

    contact.id = cursor.getLong(ContactsQuery.ID_COLUMN);

    Cursor phones = mContext.getContentResolver().query(
            ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.CONTENT_URI,
            null,
            ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.CONTACT_ID + "" = ""
                    + contact.id, null, null);
    while (phones.moveToNext()) {
        String phoneNumber = phones
                .getString(phones
                        .getColumnIndex(ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.NUMBER));
        Log.d(TAG, ""Number: "" + phoneNumber);
    }

    contact.lookupKey = cursor
            .getString(ContactsQuery.LOOKUP_KEY_COLUMN);
    contact.displayName = cursor
            .getString(ContactsQuery.DISPLAY_NAME_COLUMN);
    contact.image = bitmap;

    return contact;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>This gives me the contact number, but the query still happens in the UI thread i guess.
I want it to happen in background thread. How do i achieve this.</p>

<p>Please also tell if there is an alternate approach.</p>

<pre><code>d &lt;- combn(c$.,2)
result &lt;- unique(sapply(d,function(i) paste(d[,i],collapse="","")))
result
</code></pre>

<p>My result is:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; result

</code></pre>

<p>in order to compare with original list.</p>

<p>How can I get the frequency of the itemset in this matrix from original a_list? 
The apriori algorithm requires scanning all itemset no less than minimum support, starting from 1 dimension (i.e. ""I1"", ""I2"",...,""I5"" in a_list) to 2 dimensions (ie. ""I1,I2"" ""I1,I3"" ""I2,I3"" in this case), and then on, if it is applicable (e.g. ""I1,I2,I3""). </p>

<p>UPDATE:
Now I can find the match with a specific pattern, .e.g, (""I1"",""I2"") or (""I1"",""I3""), individually. </p>

<pre><code>toMatch &lt;- c(""I1"",""I2"")
matches &lt;- grepRaw(toMatch,a_list,ignore.case = TRUE)
matches
</code></pre>

<p>Results:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; matches
[1] 4
</code></pre>

<p>Issues remain to be resolved for matching all patterns in ""result"" (I manually input the pattern in above example, but it is needed to be extracted from ""result"") at one time. And output them in a form of:</p>

<pre><code>Itemset     Freq
""""I1"",""I2"""" 4     
""""I1"",""I3"""" 4
""""I2"",""I3"""" 4

However the maximum capacity in a path from a to b is limited by the edge with the lowest capacity.</p>

<p>Let me try to explain with a simple sample
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ay1pV.png"" alt=""Simple sample graph""></p>

<p>So the graph is a directed graph with weighted edges, and it can be cyclic. The path with the highest capacity would be s->b->t and have the capacity of 250, since that edge is setting the limit.</p>

<p>I have done a bit of reading and found out that this type of problem is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widest_path_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">""Widest path problem""</a> or I would call it something like a path with maximum minimum capacity, but I haven't found any examples or any pseudo code explaining how to tackle this.</p>

<p>I was thinking something in the lines of finding all paths from s to t, using BFS and somehow only to allow visiting a node once in a path, and then find the minimum value in the path, would that work?</p>

            'id'=&gt;'proposta-grid',
            'dataProvider'=&gt;Yii::app()-&gt;session['user']-&gt;listPropostas(),

                    ...

</code></pre>

<p>I changed the <code>dataProvider</code> from <code>$model-&gt;search()</code> to <code>User::model()-&gt;listPropostas()</code>.
The dataProvider and the filter are provided by different models.</p>

<p>This is the code for the <code>listPropostas</code> method, which works fine:</p>

<pre><code>public function listPropostas()
{
    $criteria = new CDbCriteria;
    $arrFiliais = array();
    $arrPropostas = array();

    $arrGrupos = $this-&gt;gruposId();
    foreach ($arrGrupos as $grupo) {
        $objGrupo = GrupoDeAnalistas::model()-&gt;findByPk($grupo['id']);
        foreach ($objGrupo-&gt;listFiliais() as $arr) {
            if (!in_array($arr['id'], $arrFiliais)) {
                array_push($arrFiliais, $arr['id']);
            }
        }
    }

    foreach ($arrFiliais as $arrFilial) {
        $objFilial = Filial::model()-&gt;findByPk($arrFilial['id']);
        foreach ($objFilial-&gt;listPropostas($this) as $propId) {
            if (!in_array($propId['id'], $arrPropostas)) {
                array_push($arrPropostas, $propId['id']);
            }
        }
    }

    $proposta = new Proposta;
    $criteria-&gt;addInCondition(""id"", $arrPropostas);
    return new CActiveDataProvider($proposta, array(
        'criteria' =&gt; $criteria,
    ));
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, after I changed the dataProvider the CgridView Filter stopped working</p>

<p>What i'm missing? I know that in the <code>Proposta::model()-&gt;search()</code> function, there are sets of criteria comparisons, like <code>$criteria-&gt;compare('id',$this-&gt;id)</code>.</p>

<p>What's the best way to fix this? Change my filter? Add comparisons on <code>listPropostas()</code> function?</p>

<p><strong>Original question:</strong></p>

<p>Mac here. A few days ago I installed <a href=""https://www.vagrantup.com"">Vagrant</a> and VirtualBox like so:</p>

<pre><code>brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install vagrant
brew cask install vagrant-manager
</code></pre>

<p>...which got it Vagrant up and running no problem whatsoever. I was able to <code>vagrant init hashicorp/precise32; vagrant up</code> and everything looked like it was running perfect (<code>hashicorp/precise32</code> uses VirtualBox by default).</p>

<p>Then last night I installed <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/mac/step_three/"">Docker</a>, which also requires VirtualBox, and got it up and running with no problem whatsoever. I was even able to get the <code>whalesay</code> container examples working. So far so good.</p>

<p>Today I went to go play around in Vagrant, and it looks like my Docker install hosed my Vagrant/VirtualBox configuration.</p>

<p><em>Now</em>, when I run <code>vagrant init hashicorp/precise32</code> on an empty directory, and then run <code>vagrant up</code>, I get:</p>

<pre><code>myuser@mymac:~/sandbox/myapp$vagrant up
No usable default provider could be found for your system.

Vagrant relies on interactions with 3rd party systems, known as
""providers"", to provide Vagrant with resources to run development
environments. Examples are VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V.

The easiest solution to this message is to install VirtualBox, which
is available for free on all major platforms.

If you believe you already have a provider available, make sure it
is properly installed and configured. You can see more details about
why a particular provider isn't working by forcing usage with
`vagrant up --provider=PROVIDER`, which should give you a more specific
error message for that particular provider.
</code></pre>

<p>So then I tried specifying the provider type, even though I shouldn't have to, just to see what happens:</p>

<pre><code>myuser@mymac:~/sandbox/myapp$vagrant up --provider=VirtualBox
The provider 'VirtualBox' could not be found, but was requested to
back the machine 'cortex'. Please use a provider that exists.
</code></pre>

<p>And just for good measure, running <code>vagrant -v</code> produces <code>Vagrant 1.7.2</code> as output.</p>

<p>Any ideas what went awry and what the fix is?</p>

I've created a page that lists the taxonomy of a custom-post-type. The issue I'm running into is the page that links from this listing should only pull the category and a placement code (in the example that's standard). It's pulling the placement but how do I get it to add in the dynamically created category pulled from the previous page. </p>

<p>Code that dynamically pulls taxonomy (category header). This pulls the right category on the page.</p>

<pre><code>logical= (mydata$Group != 1 &amp; mydata$Group != 2 &amp; mydata$Year !=2011)
mydata_wk = mydata[logical,]
</code></pre>

<p>Now- I would like to plot this data. My problem is that when I plot this using the command below the X axis still shows the years that I deleted via indexing. For example, on the plot it will show 2011 which I deleted using the index above. I have tried to convert the same set to a data.matrix but it turns the years into numbers which correspond to the original data frame's year column which I DO NOT want to plot. What I want is to plot just the values that are in the final data frame after indexing. Any thoughts on this?</p>

My ojective is that when the user clicks on cancel, I ignore ongoing user changes from the form but I update in my controller some of the fields of the same entity.</p>

When cancel is clicked, my controller has to handle the request in order to identity that cancel has been clicked.

I am trying to print a long grid, which was dynamically generated.</p>

<pre><code>pdoc.PrintPage += (p, args) =&gt;
        {
            args.PageVisual = myGrid;
            args.HasMorePages = false;
        };
</code></pre>

<p>When I use <code>args.HasMorePages = false;</code>, it prints the first page of the grid as it should (although it takes some time, since it sends a 123MB big bitmap to the poor printer - thanks for silverlight 4's print feature implementation.).</p>

<p>However, when I enable printing more pages with<code>args.HasMorePages = true;</code>, the printing job runs amok on the memory and sends endless copies of the first printing page of the document - effectively disabling my developer machine. Even if the grid is only 2 pages long.</p>

<p>Why does this happen? 
What is a possible workaround here? All I found on the net is that SL handles printing badly, but not a real solution.</p>

<p>Looking through some of the classes in ServiceStack.Examples, I noticed that most of the services contain only one method. Either some override on <code>Execute()</code> or, if a REST service, some override of <code>OnPost/Get/Put/Delete()</code>. </p>

<p>How should I approach making a full API set, if I have tens of functions I need implemented <code>RegisterUser()</code>, <code>RemoveUser()</code>, <code>AddFriend()</code>, <code>RemoveFriend()</code> ... One service per method? </p>

<pre><code>public RegisterUserService : IService&lt;User&gt; { public object Execute(User&gt; dto) { ... } }
public RemoveUserService : IService&lt;User&gt; { public object Execute(User&gt; dto) { ... } }
public AddFriendService : IService&lt;Friend&gt; { public object Execute(Friend dto) { ... } }
public RemoveFriendService: IService&lt;RequestDTO4&gt; { public object Execute(Friend dto) { ... } }
</code></pre>

<p>I'm pretty lost on how to begin implementing a full API set. I've read the <a href=""https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Create-your-first-webservice"">first</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Your-first-webservice-explained"">second</a> wiki page on 'Creating your first webservice', which I've copied to make 1 service method. But now I want to make 10 or 40 service methods and I'm not sure how to do that. </p>

<p>I noticed that implementing from <code>IRestService&lt;T&gt;</code> allows you up to 4 methods instead of the one <code>Execute()</code> method, simply because each method corresponds to a different HTTP verb. So is there something like that I could write? Basically something like:</p>

<pre><code>public MyService : IService/IRestService/ServiceBase?&lt;User&gt;
{
     public object AddUser(User user) { }
     public object RemoveUser(User user) { }
     public object ModifyUser(User user) { }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just looking for something that doesn't necessarily have to contain all methods in one service class, but as many as reasonably possible ... do I really have to create 1 service for each service method? </p>

<p>Note on pursuing a strictly RESTful architecture: I only read up a little on REST, but it seems like I'd have to strictly follow rules like: treat everything as a resource even if you have to re-design your models, no verbs in the URL names (/Friends, not /GetFriends because REST gives you OnGet(), OnPost(), OnPut(), and OnDelete() ... basically I'm interested in the easiest, quickest, and most painless way of implementing a a few dozen service methods. It's a personal project, so the requirements won't vary too much.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for guiding me through this first step.</p>

<p>Mythz said there's no ""ServiceStack way"" to design. The guy's question is pretty much like mine. I'm wondering how to stack a lot of service methods in a service.</p>

<p>I just tested the code below successfully with working routes:</p>

<pre><code>[Route(""/registerUser/setEmail/{Email}"")]
[Route(""/registerUser/setPassword/{Password}"")]
[Route(""/registerUser/setPhoneNumber/{PhoneNumber}"")]
[Route(""/lalal2395823"")]
[Route(""/test3234/test23423511"")]
public class RegisterUser
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string Nickname { get; set; }
    public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But <strong>what I'd like is for each <code>[Route(""path"")]</code> to go to a <em>different</em> method</strong>, instead of having them all parsed in <code>Execute()</code> and having to parse which string isn't null or empty.</p>

<h2>My Solution</h2>

<p>I decided to take Rickard's advice and make a proper REST API, because it seems simpler and cleaner in the end.</p>

<p>This is now my class using <a href=""https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/New-API"">the new ServiceStack API (new as of 9/24/12)</a>:</p>

[Route(""/User/{FirstName}/{LastName}/{Nickname}/{PhoneNumber}"", ""POST"")]
[Route(""/User/{FirstName}/{LastName}/{Nickname}/{PhoneNumber}/{Email}"", ""POST"")]
public class CreateUser : IReturn&lt;UserModel&gt;
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string Nickname { get; set; }
    public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
}

public class CreateUserService : Service

   public object Post(CreateUser request)
    {
        try
        {
            using (var session = FluentNHibernateHelper.OpenSession())
            {
                using (var transaction = session.BeginTransaction())
                {
                    var user = new UserModel()
                    {
                        FirstName = request.FirstName,

                        Nickname = request.Nickname,

                    session.SaveOrUpdate(user);
                    transaction.Commit();

</code></pre>

<p>First problem is, spoiler, strong and emphasis can include each other in arbitrary order. And its possible that later I'll need more such inline markups.</p>

<p>My current solution involves just creating separate token for each combination (inline_noast, inline_nostrong, etc), but obviously, number of such combinations grows too fast with growing number of markup elements.</p>

<p>Second problem is that these lookaheads in strong/emphasis behave VERY poorly on some cases of bad markup like <code>__._.__*__.__...___._.____.__**___***</code> (lots of randomly placed markup symbols). It takes minutes to parse few kb of such random text.</p>

<p>Is it something wrong with my grammar or I should use some other kind of parser for this task?</p>

<p>So it's as if github is stuck somewhere and I don't really know how to fix it in a nice way (git push tells me that nothing needs to be updated)</p>

<p>I feel like the only way to fix this is for me to create a new branch, push it and merge it back to the master branch...</p>

<p>Clearly, question says if the ASCII numbers are prime that means you'd have to remove the character. It means If i give input..</p>

<p><strong>Input</strong></p>

<pre><code>4

<p><strong>OUTPUT must be</strong></p>

<p>Okay, finally i hope you understand this question above .. So as far as i tried this codes:</p>

<pre><code>package lesson.practice;

<p>So, this means that we can either:
i. Mix content and have browsers freak out.
   (Unacceptable since we train users not to trust mixed content pages.)
ii. Make the site non-https. (REALLY unacceptable.)</p>

<p>I was thinking that we could run a relay on one of our servers, for which the browsers could hit using SSL, this server would then act as a proxy to the non-SSL mjpeg streams.</p>

<p>We know the IPs of the cameras (static), so we can check that and guard against dns attacks. And you can't establish a TCP-IP connection if you're spoofing an IP (makes 3-way handshake impossible), so I don't see this as disingenuous.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that gdb is hanging because it's waiting for the application to stop at the next instruction and somehow the application finished execution without gdb identifying this.

<p>I have a form which is a modelForm. It doesn't add any extra fields ('comment' and 'statement' are the only fields used and they exist in the model). On the textarea field, 'comment', of that form I would like to use TinyMCE. I have tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>class EntryForm(forms.ModelForm):
    comment = forms.CharField(widget=TinyMCE(attrs={'cols': 80, 'rows': 30}, mce_attrs=TINYMCE_USER_CONFIG))

    class Meta:
        model = Entry
        fields = ['statement','comment',]
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>class EntryForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Entry
        fields = ['statement','comment',]

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(EntryForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields['comment'].widget = TinyMCE(attrs={'cols': 80, 'rows': 15}, mce_attrs=TINYMCE_USER_CONFIG,)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>class EntryForm(forms.ModelForm):

    class Meta:
        model = Entry
        fields = ['statement','comment',]

    class Media:
        js = ('/media/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/tiny_mce.js',
                '/sitemedia/js/tinymce_setup.js',)
</code></pre>

<p>In the <code>HEAD</code> html tags I have put <code>{{ form.media }}</code> (the form is called <code>form</code> in the views and template). I am also using Grappelli and Filebrowser for the Admin.</p>

<p>Could someone please explain what I'm missing or the process of getting this to work?
Thanks very much!</p>

<p>But here I am not getting the expected result.</p>

<p>When test this in my local-host I got 127.0.0.1</p>

<p>When I deploy this into my development server and browse the page in my local machine, I got different address.</p>

<p>I tried accessing the same URL in other machine and IP address are same.</p>

<p>The systems I am using to access my development server deployed page in in same network.</p>

<p>So is it the network IP my code returned..?</p>

<p>Because when I find my IP using ipconfig command it's again a different!</p>

<p>And when I checked my IP using 3rd party site (<a href=""http://www.whatismyip.com/ip-address-lookup/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whatismyip.com/ip-address-lookup/</a>), it shows the actual IP I expected. How can I get that actual IP using C# code?</p>

<p>My ultimate goal is, get the user location details who is browsing my site using Maxmind City DB, but for that I need to pass the IP of browsing user.</p>

<pre><code>string ip = GetUserIP();
string db = “GeoIP2-City.mmdb"";
var reader = new DatabaseReader(db);
var city = reader.City(ip);
double? lat = city.Location.Latitude;
double? lang = city.Location.Longitude;
</code></pre>

<p>For the IP I got from my above code, I got exception (IP not found in Database) when I tried to get information from Maxmind DB, 
but for the IP I got from ""whatismyip"" website, I got the details from the Maxmind DB.</p>

<p>Hope My question is clear.
Please let me know if anyone have any inputs.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Sharath</p>

<p>The entries are structured as follows</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""value_a"": ""Foo"",
    ""value_b"": ""Bar"",
    ""value_c"": ""Baz""
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Elastic Search this then looks as follows (taken from querying my Elastic Search endpoint directly) :</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""_index"": ""foo_bar_bazindex"",
    ""_type"": ""foo_bar_baz"",
    ""_id"": ""4"",
    ""_score"": 1,
    ""_source"": {
        ""value_a"": ""Foo"",
        ""value_b"": ""Bar"",
        ""value_c"": ""Baz""
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The combinations of value a, b and c are unique.</p>

<p>I want to find the values of ""value_c"" by performing a bool filtered search with the values a and b.</p>

<p>In my code I have been trying this as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    $filter = new \Elastica\Filter\Bool();
    $query = new \Elastica\Query();

    $aFilter = new \Elastica\Filter\Term(['value_a' =&gt; ""Foo""]);
    $bFilter = new \Elastica\Filter\Term(['value_b' =&gt; ""Bar""]);

    $filter-&gt;addMust($aFilter);
    $filter-&gt;addMust($bFilter);

    $query-&gt;setFilter($filter);

    $results = $this-&gt;bookingPeriodIndex-&gt;search($query)-&gt;getResults();

    var_dump($results);
</code></pre>

<p>However this returns no results (the var dump outputs an empty array) - also manually trying this query by posting this query directly to the server:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""query"": {
        ""filtered"": {
            ""filter"": {
                ""bool"": {
                    ""must"": [
                        {
                            ""term"": {
                                ""value_a"": ""Foo""
                            }
                        },
                        {
                            ""term"": {
                                ""value_b"": ""Bar""
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This also yields no results - I would however expect it to return one result as I have the following entry:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""value_a"": ""Foo"",
    ""value_b"": ""Bar"",
    ""value_c"": ""Baz""
}
</code></pre>

<p>Am I missing something? Could it be due to the small dataset? We use the same Bool Filter Elastica queries elsewhere in our codebase and these work as expected, however I cannot seem to get any data to return from this index.</p>

<p>I am trying to address my formatting issue with this question here.</p>

<p>With the code below, i read in a text file using StreamReader, and the selections come in all on the same line as I want them too seperated by a BAR (""|""). Unfortunately, the bar prints at the end of each word, not actually 'between' each word. I don't want the last bar to print. I know i could cheat and add a bar to the font with a Console.Write(""|"") but that would be cheating in my mind - i wouldn't really be printing/displaying a bar between the words as I was trying to make a more elegant console selection.</p>

<pre><code> 1. if (num%2 == 0) { /* even */ } 
 2. if ((num&amp;1) == 0) { /* even */ }
</code></pre>

<p>I consider the second option to be far more elegant and meaningful, and that's the one I usually use. But it is not only a matter of taste; The actual performance may vary: usually the bitwise operations (such as the logial-and here) are far more efficient than a mod (or div) operation. Of course, you may argue that some compilers will be able to optimize it anyway, and I agree...but some won't.</p>

<p>Another point is that the second one might be a little harder to comprehend for less experienced programmers. On that I'd answer that it will probably only benefit everybody if these programmers take that short time to understand statements of this kind.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>The given two snippets are correct only if <code>num</code> is either an unsigned int, or a negative number with a two's complement representation. - As some comments righfuly state.</p>

<p>Do you know of any way to do this in Visual Studio (perhaps with an Add-In)?  </p>

If a ""Floating"" document is active and some menu is selected (e.g Edit -> Paste), then the ""Floating"" document still has Focus and the command will be executed against that ""Floating"" window. Also, notice how this is clearly visible in the UI. MainWindow.xaml is still active and the Main window in Visual Studio is inactive even though the Team-menu is selected.</p>

<p>I've been trying to get the same behavior using alot of different 3rd-party docking components but they all have the same problem: once I select the menu, the MainWindow is focused and my floating window does not have focus anymore.

I recently had a very unpleasant experience when one of my applications kept freezing the computers on which it was working. This is obviously related to the lack of hardware power, because it works perfectly on the stronger computers that I used for testing purposes, where the application worked perfectly. So my question is - is there a way to calculate the amount of hardware power needed to run the application smoothly?
Almost all of my applications are done in C#, so I would need a method that can work with that type of application.

<p>My concern here is, before actually setting the entire content to data model, is there any specific way to set the  parameters to empty string?</p>

<p>Like there are two entities as ""time_zone"" = """"; and ""utc_offset"" = """"; Is there anyway to iterate through the json response and set @"""" empty string. I don't want to validate for NSNULL feature at every key point, and it can cause my app to have some loop holes to crash at some point, therefore I just want to figure out how to iterate through such complex json to check each entity and set empty string for NSNull type class. I did tried recursive way but it only gives the list of the upper level keys not the entities within the dictionary. </p>

</code></pre>

<p>When I do a search with nil as query, I'd expect to have all 8027 document matching the search.</p>

<pre><code>r = Variant.search nil
</code></pre>

<p>But when I check the number of matching entries with <code>total_entries</code>, I actually get more results :</p>

<pre><code>r.total_entries
 =&gt; 15054 
</code></pre>

<p>How is this possible ? What I am missing ?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 23/09/2015</strong></p>

<p>As suggested by Eugene, multiple indices are the cause of my issue :</p>

<p>'total_entries"" counts the number of documents found in all indeces (_core and _delta).</p>

<p>Now, I would need a way to know how many instance of my model ('Variant') corresponds to the sphinx documents.</p>

<ol>
<li>Application logic is done in node.js/express</li>
<li>Some of this logic/variables is passed into jade/ejs html engine to dynamically serve html</li>
<li>CSS still formats the served html depending on requesting device. </li>
</ol>

<p>Forgive me, it just seems like lines are starting to blur with all this JS; it's hard to tell what logic should be done in node.js/express and what logic should be done in jade/ejs.</p>

<p>This gets even blurrier when using websockets, since there is logic going on the client-side. So there's display control logic going on at 5 different places.</p>

<p>Can anyone show me how to populate data into a nested table when the table is part of a datatype within a record? And how do I check once it has been populated. And how to assign this back to a cursor variable for the out parameter?</p>

<p>I am new to qss files and have been experimenting, but cannot figure out if some things are possible.  The ""left"" property is defined here: <a href=""http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.2/stylesheet.html#left-attr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.2/stylesheet.html#left-attr</a> but nothing happens when I try to use it.</p>

<p>margin-left actually moves the button, but only relationally.  So, if the buttons are positioned in the ui file with a gap of 100 between them, a margin-left for the second button in the list is offset by 100.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?  Could it be some setting in the ui file that is preventing it from moving?  I already ""broke layout"" and it doesn't seem to matter.  Is there a good resource you'd suggest?</p>

<p>Here is a sample of my qss file.  The left has no effect.</p>

<pre><code>QPushButton#Button_1 
{       
    min-width: 50;
    max-width: 50;
    min-height: 50;
    max-height: 50; 
    position:absolute;
    subcontrol-origin: border;  
    left:200;
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:
I've figured out that I can change the position of the button by deriving a class from QPushButton and making a ""GeomX"" qproperty.  This seems to work, but I am running into an odd issue now.  When I first load my app, it draws the buttons as they are positioned on the ui file.  When I use the ""change theme"" option that I've coded, and select the currently loaded theme, it moves the buttons as I'd expect.  However, resizing the app dumps them back to the ui positions and restarting also places them back in their ui positions.  Is there a setting in the ui file that I could alter to get it to stop moving them?  Is there a load-order issue that I need to address?  Is it possible to even address this?  What is going on?</p>

<p>My problem is when I check the grammar I get the following error and just can’t find an appropriate way to fix this:</p>

<pre><code>rule statement has non-LL(*) decision 
due to recursive rule invocations reachable from alts 1,2.  
Resolve by left-factoring or using syntactic predicates 
or using backtrack=true option. 
|---&gt; statement : assignment
</code></pre>

<p>Also I have the problem with declarationsequence and simpleexpression. </p>

<p>When I use <code>options { … backtrack = true; … }</code> it at least compiles, but obviously doesn’t work right anymore when I run a test-file, but I can’t find a way to resolve the left-recursion on my own (or maybe I’m just too blind at the moment because I’ve looked at this for far too long now). Any ideas how I could change the lines where the errors occurs to make it work? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
I could fix one of the three mistakes. <code>statement</code> works now. The problem was that <code>assignment</code> and <code>procedurecall</code> both started with <code>designator</code>.</p>

<pre><code>statement : procedureassignmentcall

<p><strong>EDITED</strong>
The basic goal is to somehow get client-local file data across a remote web service, which provides JNA access to a DLL written in C that needs the file data.  I can fiddle with the DLL code if needed, but I am not so much a C programmer for the past several decades.</p>

<p>Longer version:
We have C-code that has been converted from a standalone application to a set of DLLs in hopes of converting the functionality into a set of services.  We have access to the C code and the ability to further change as necessary. But we are a Java shop and so there is not a wealth of C experience here (especially myself), so I hope to do the least amount of surgery on the C code.  I would also rather avoid trying to convert the core of the working mission-critical C code to Java, for fear of breaking it in the process.  But I am trying to write SOAP web services to access the DLL functionality remotely through multiple clients.  Someone initially wrote a JNA layer to access one of the simpler static interfaces.  But some of the modes of the old C application read an arbitrary number of files (currently local to the client) from a client-provided file list.</p>

<p>I am trying to figure what kind of options there are for sending text file data through my JNA interface, and what is required of the client to send the files.  I saw <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1337525/pass-inputstream-through-jna-to-c-code-as-a-file-pointer"">another SO question</a> indicating that sending Java <code>InputStream</code>s as C FILE pointers is an unlikely or impossible route to go.  The JNA example interfaces I have seen so far for tasks other than file transfer define Java classes extending <code>Structure</code> with pre-sized byte[] array fields for sending string data -- my files are text files.  But I do not know how many files will be found in the file list nor what the size of each file is going to be.</p>

<p>Would the JNA <code>Pointer</code> come to my rescue somehow?  How would the JNA <code>Pointer</code> work across remote calls, and would it work with files directly or would I read in file contents into a <code>StringBuffer</code>, convert to a dynamically sized byte array and pass a <code>Pointer</code>?  Does SAAJ come into play at all?</p>

<p>The issue: I can reference everything in the array except for 5 values that I recently added, I var_dump the array and they're not there when they're clearly in the file. I've reuploaded the files to my web server around 5/6 times, restarted php, restarted the server and it's not fixed. The issue does not occur on my local machine (Windows) but it does occur on my Linux server (Ubuntu).</p>

<p>The array is structured like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

global $Configuration;

$Configuration = array(

    ""PredefinedValues"" =&gt; array(

        ""Example"" =&gt; ""example"",
        ""123"" =&gt; ""test"",
        ""abc"" =&gt; ""test2"",
        ""asdf"" =&gt; ""value2"",
        ""val2"" =&gt; ""value3"",

    ),
</code></pre>

<p>And the values I wouldn't be able to access are abc/asdf - but all of the values above/below it are fine.</p>

<p>Init file:</p>

<pre><code>require_once(""config/Config.php"");

Class Lib
{

    Public $Root            =   __DIR__;
    Public $DependencyRoot;

    }

}

?&gt;

<p>Var_dumping the array within the __construct doesn't work, but when I var_dump it straight after the require, it works fine.</p>

As a starting point I just added ""tools.gzip.on = True"" to my [/] configuration.  I know the configuration file and block are being parsed correctly, because I also added options to disable caching in the response headers, since I'm changing the files frequently as I develop the site.  I am seeing ""Expires"" and ""Pragma: no-cache"" headers in my responses.</p>

<p>I'll add that Yslow is only reporting that my external CSS and JavaScript files (served by the same cherrypy process) need to be compressed, even though the headers shown by ""wget -S"" don't show gzip encoding even on the main page itself (which is dynamic content).</p>

<li>network-->TPCircularBuffer.... which is then pulled to the output side of the ioUnit through the callback.</li>

<p>Now whenever I try and start the graph I get <code>kAudioFormatUnsupportedDataFormatError</code>. From searching around, this error pops up because I am trying to write an invalid file format. But as you can see above, I am not writing any files?? So what gives? I'm guessing from the error description, there is something wrong with the AudioStreamBasicDescription, but wouldn't it give me an error when I was setting it up?</p>

<p>This is how my stream is being setup. Both functions return noErr.</p>

If you want to override the I/O streams, you can do so by setting the handles in STARTUPINFO fields hStdOutput, hStdInput, and hStdError and setting the flag STARTF_USESTDHANDLES.</p>

<p>But what if you want to override only one of the handles?  For example, I might want to redirect stderr to a file while leaving the stdout and stdin connected to the new console window.</p>

<p>The STARTF_USESTDHANDLES flag tells CreateProcess to replace all of the handles instead of connecting them to the ones for the new console window.  So it seems we must provide all three handles.  Obviously I can set hStdError to the handle of the log file, but what values should be used for hStdInput and hStdOutput?</p>

<p>I tried using NULL, which seems to work on Windows 8.1, but it doesn't work on Windows 7.</p>

<p>I also thought about creating a console window first, and then calling CreateProcess with handles to the new console window's buffers (and omitting the CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE flag).  Unfortunately, the parent process is also a console application, and it seems a console application cannot create a second console window.</p>

<pre><code>Size
  [XS]
  [S]

Color
  [Red]
  [Blue]
</code></pre>

<p>The tags are in ""tagsets"", one tagset to many tags.</p>

<p>My question: how can I chain together multiple filter queries when the user wants to narrow down the search?</p>

<p>When the user picks XS from the first box, it should filter the result set on that tag alone. When the user picks XS and S, we add to the filter and get more results. Still not a problem with a named scope. But what if the user wants to filter XS and S and then Red color from the second box? That's when things get hairy - I can't just tack on another Item.by_tag(""tagname"") for that tag, it needs to be a tag filter on the results I already have, narrowing the results down.</p>

<p>Multiple checkboxes in the same tagset box - more results. A check in another tagset box - fewer results. I tried doing one SELECT for each tagset box and then merging the result sets in ruby to show only the hits that were in all the sets, but that breaks the pagination since I never know how many results will be returned. It feels like this needs to be one query and it's probably some kind of join, but I'm not great at SQL and I can't figure it out. This is what the relevant parts of the schema looks like:</p>

<pre><code>create_table ""items"" do |t|
  t.string   ""title""
end

create_table ""items_tags"", :id =&gt; false do |t|
  t.integer ""item_id""
  t.integer ""tag_id""
end

create_table ""tags"" do |t|
  t.string   ""title""
  t.integer  ""tagset_id""

This works fine, however when you go farther down the page and click the images towards the bottom, the lightbox still works but clicking anything will immediately jump to the top of the page. I originally said I could help thinking it was an easy fix, but I really don't know what's going on.</p>

<p>I've tried using preventDefault on clicks to the images, I've tried looking into the basic documentation for the plugin and messing with the parameters passed in, but to no luck.</p>

<p>I realize that this is not a lot for you all to work with, but on the off chance that someone has had this problem before or just someone knows a possible solution, please let me know!</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Edit: I simplified the page down to one image so you can see the jump that takes place easier.</p>

<p>I was thinking of using Queue.Last() as an alternative to Queue.Peek() (which I assume is basically the same as Queue.First()) But I'm wondering if this means an enumerator will literally enumerator over the entire queue before reaching the last element. Since my queues will be very large, this can be a problem.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>To put into perspective what I'm trying to do: Say I want to keep a minute by minute database of the price of a stock for the last 20 years. This would be many data points. In order to do this, I would like to enqueue the lastest price at every minute, and dequeue the earliest price when the size of the queue gets above 20 years. However, I also want a convenient way to get the most recent price from the queue. I know about Queue.Last(), which will do the trick, but I just want to know if it will be terribly inefficient.</p>

<p>I am confused that adding an element in vecA seems to change the md5 Code of vecB and so their hashes are still the same. Whats the reason and is their any advantage in using  java.security.MessageDigest or simply hashCode() in that case? How about the performance of hash functions vs. comparisons of all attributes?</p>

<pre><code>PluginFolder
 - customClassFile.php
 + librairies
   - autoload.php (Facebook's automatic loading)

<pre><code>//customClassFile.php
require_once( dirname(__FILE__) . '/libraries/autoload.php' );

use Facebook\FacebookSession;

class CustomClass {
  public function __construct() {

    FacebookSession::setDefaultApplication('appId', 'secret_key');
  }
}

<p>In the <code>autoload.php</code> file I know it's finding the classes because I echoed something after</p>

<pre><code>if (file_exists($file)) {
    echo('found');
    require $file;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried many other stuff but this seems to be the more logical and I still get an error saying that <code>FacebookSession</code> could not be found.</p>

<p>The framework I'm using is Wolf CMS but you probably never heard of it. Like I said, it's similar to CodeIgniter.</p>

<p>This is the important part of my error stack</p>

<pre><code>spl_autoload_call('Facebook\FacebookSession')  on line 13 in [...]
    AutoLoader→load('Facebook\FacebookSession')  on line unknown in unknown

<p>But for some unfriendly, Javascript-heavy sites, our users have to visit the site manually, navigate to the right spot, and copy and paste into our application.</p>

<p>Other than bookmarklets, is there <strong>any way</strong> for our page to show an IFRAME with the source web site loaded, allow the user to navigate within the frame, and then capture the IFRAME's body?</p>

<p>Since the site in the IFRAME isn't in the same domain (not even close), I can't seem to work around browser cross-site scripting limitations. I've tried using HTML5's ""sandbox"" feature, but it appears to only allow communication (via ""allow-same-origin"") the <em>other</em> way, from the IFRAME to the host site, which isn't useful to me. Also, it doesn't work if the site in question attempts to load its frames to the top context.</p>

<p>What I'm ideally looking for is a solution that would allow the browser to be configured to trust my web site implicitly (it's an intranet app) and allow it to access any frame's contents. That would at least get me in the ballpark. Bonus points if I can get the iframe to redefine the ""top"" context as its own frame, so the hosted site functions properly within the frame.</p>

<p>In Python 3, I'd code it like this:</p>

<pre><code>    class base:
        @classmethod    
        def func(cls):
            print(""in base: "" + cls.__name__)

    class child(base):

            super().func()
            print(""in child: "" + cls.__name__)

    child.func()
</code></pre>

<p>with this output:</p>

<pre><code>    in base: child
    in child: child
</code></pre>

<p>However, I have no idea, how do this in Python 2. Of course, I can use <code>base.func()</code>, but I don't like to specify parent class name in addition and mainly I get unwanted result:</p>

<pre><code>    in base: base
    in child: child
</code></pre>

<p>With <code>cls</code> (<code>cls is child</code>) as first argument in <code>super()</code> function call, I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>    TypeError: must be type, not classobj
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea how do it using <code>super()</code> or analogous function in which I don't have to specify name of parent class?</p>

<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'click', function() {
    infowindow.open(map,marker);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now I am trying to duplicate this in dart using the js library. So far I have something like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>final google_maps = context['google']['maps'];

var myLatlng = [43.5, -6.5];
var center = new JsObject(google_maps['LatLng'], myLatlng);

var mapTypeId = google_maps['MapTypeId']['ROADMAP'];

var mapOptions = new JsObject.jsify({
  ""center"": center,
  ""zoom"": 8,
  ""mapTypeId"": mapTypeId
});

var map = new JsObject(google_maps['Map'], [querySelector('#map-canvas'), mapOptions]);

var marker = new JsObject(google_maps['Marker'], [new JsObject.jsify({
  'position': center,
  'map': map,
  'title': 'Hello World!'
})]);

var tooltip = '&lt;div id=""content""&gt;Info window coontent&lt;/div&gt;';

var infowindow = new JsObject(google_maps['InfoWindow'], [new JsObject.jsify({
""content"": tooltip
})]);


google_maps['event'].callMethod('addListener', [marker, 'click', () {
  infowindow.callMethod('open',[map,marker]);
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is that I set the 'addListener' method through google_maps['event'], but when I click the marker, I get a NoSuchMethodError:</p>

<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>Closure call with mismatched arguments: function 'call'

<p>I am aware that there is a <a href=""https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/google_maps"" rel=""nofollow"">google_maps dart package</a>, but I want the interact with the javascript api using dart's js library.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>In team.html template </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div progress-bar progress=""{{team.progress}}""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It works good with this scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>open page with all teams in report -> progress bars have correct color</li>
<li>click on tab to open only one team -> progress bar has correct color</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem is when I want to do next step:</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>click on tab to open next team -> progress bar has previous color, it is not reset</li>
</ol>

<p>But when do this:</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>click first tab to show all teams in report $scope.loadAllTeams() -> all progress bar have correct color</li>
</ol>

<p>So I dont now what is going on. It is something with reset scope. Why progressBar directive resets when change between loadAllTeam() and loadTeam() functions but not resets when change beetwen one team and another?</p>

The original problem is that I've got a list of employees, each of them has various trainings. Each of these trainings has some pre requirements. For example to have your Class 1 drivers license you must have your Class 5. If I remove the Class 5 I need to check disable the Class 1.</p>

<p>Now as this is a tree with no fixed max depth (actually I stop checking at 10ish) I decided to use recursion. I wrote two stored procedures</p>

<pre><code>[dbo].[spCheckTrainingPreqs]
@PIN int,
@training_id int,
@missingTraining int OUTPUT
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>[dbo].[spCheckTrainingPreqsEmployee] 
@PIN int
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I call spCheckTrainingPreqsEmployee with an employee number it creates a cursor for each pin/training_id combo and calls spCheckTrainingPreqs. spCheckTrainingPreqs uses a recursive local cursor to walk the tree.</p>

<p>Now the kicker. It works fine in visual studio</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @return_value int

EXEC    @return_value = [dbo].[spCheckTrainingPreqsEmployee]
        @PIN = 12673

SELECT  'Return Value' = @return_value

GO
</code></pre>

<p>But if I go into visual studio and add it to a table adapter as a stored proc with no return I get the error ""Maximum stored procedure, function, trigger, or view nesting level exceeded (limit 32)""</p>

<p>I've checked that none of my tables have triggers. The only complexity is that many of the tables have views based off of them with sub queries and even a c# coded custom concatenation function. Remember running it from SQL manager works fine.</p>

<p>My didFinishingPickingWithMediaInfo method looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info
{
    if ([[info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerMediaType] isEqual: @""public.image""]) {
        imageInfo = info;

        }];
        //Perform segue
        [self performSegueWithIdentifier:@""imageSegue"" sender:self];
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then I have it going to the prepareForSegue method as follows:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender
{
    if ([segue.identifier isEqual: @""imageSegue""]) {

        ImageViewController *ivc = [segue destinationViewController];
        ivc.imageInfo = self.imageInfo;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I tired adding a completion block at the end of the dismissViewControllerAnimated to log if it completed and it just jumps over that block never closes the pickerView, and therefor doesn't preform the segue.</p>

<p>Not sure why...any thought?</p>

<p>high/lowPriorityTasks methods have a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>function high/lowPriorityTasks() {

    getTasks().then(function (response) {

       // stuff

    }).then(function () {

       // stuff 

    }).fail(function (err) {

       // stuff
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Console Output</strong> for this should be:</p>

<pre><code>Initiating process...
Process started at XXX

Processing HIGH priority tasks...
HIGH priority taks processed.

Processing LOW priority tasks...
LOW priority taks processed.

Finishing process...
Process terminated at XXX
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Important notes</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Functions initialize, initiate, finalize and terminate, their last command is return; 
but I am not sure if it is correct.</li>
<li>I am using jQuery 1.10.2 and asp.net MVC 4</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Observed issues</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When executing it, a runtime error is raised saying that the object
does not accept the property or method 'then' at line bolded:</p>

<p>highPriorityTasksDeferred= startDeferred.then(initialize).done(initiate);</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>First attempt</strong>:</p>

<p>As kenneth has said, brackets after $.Deferred were missed so by adding them $.Deferred() the process is executed but some issues appears: It seems like, the high/lowPriorityTasks functions are not executed as in the console is displayed:</p>

<pre><code>Initiating process...
Process started at XXX


Finishing process...

Process terminated at XXX
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas? Also i would like to know if the return; in the functions initialize, initiate, finalize and terminate is the best way to do it or there is another best option.</p>

<p><strong>Second attempt</strong>:</p>

<p>Some brackets were missed for highPriorityTasks and lowPriorityTasks when called so now they are executed correctly but the problem is that they are not done in order....</p>

<p>...and this is how I instantiate CKEditor in my code:</p>

                    {""name"": ""basicstyles"", ""groups"": [""basicstyles""]},

                removePlugins: 'magicline'

<p>Finally... these are the errors I get in Firebug when I try to load CKEditor using my uglified code on production (it works perfectly before optimising in my dev environment):</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I've tried to set the path inside the CKEditor instantiation code using 'skins: ../path/to/ckeditor/css/files' but that doesn't work either.  Incidentally I've also tried downloading CKEditor from the website and installing it fresh with 'boswer install ckeditor' but can't get it work once uglified and combined into my code using grunt.</p>

<p>Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong? Does anyone else have this working? I'm sure folks out there must have it working and it's just my ignorance holding me back.</p>

<pre><code>Zend\ServiceManager\Exception\ServiceNotFoundException: Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManager::get was unable to fetch or create an instance for doctrine.authenticationservice.orm_default
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is the service manager in onBoostrap is not able to initialize authentication adapter, this is the code with problem</p>

<pre><code>$authService = $serviceManager-&gt;get('Zend\Authentication\AuthenticationService');
</code></pre>

<p>When i disable $authService all unit test runs successfully, i am not able to figure out the exact issue causing this, what could be the possible issue here?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>So, SO Community, I pose of you these questions:</p>

<p>What sort of limitations does Swing/Java have for Unicode support?  Are there certain subsets of unicode that are completely supported and what should I stay away from when designing in the future?</p>

<p>I am designing an application and I can't seem to get my head around this problem. My application will have different types of pictures: company, profile, machine, etc... and we are expecting a LOT of pictures. Now, since we will have a lot of different types of pictures,  I was thinking of creating a base class called ""pictures"" in Django, and then create all the subclasses from that. That would give n tables in my database. Hence the querying would be faster since I wouldn't have one giant table with all my pictures, and have to do JOINS on a category table when I want pictures of a certain type. </p>

<p>To do this, I will have to use generic foreign keys in Django. Is that good practice? Is my design a good practice or not? I was told Generic Foreign Keys were not that good of an idea... why?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: I won't be storing the image per se in the table, just the path within the AWS S3 Bucket!</p>

I would like to draw this border around my undecorated <code>JFrame</code>. I'm currently using the following method inside my <code>JFrame</code> to set the border:</p>

<pre><code>DropShadowBorder b = new DropShadowBorder(Color.BLACK, 0, 10, 0.2f, 10, true, true, true, true);
this.getRootPane().setBorder(b);
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note: I'm using the root pane of the frame to draw the border on, because the frame doesn't support borders itself.</em></p>

<p>The problem is that the borders are drawn inside the component itself, as you can see in the picture bellow, the shadowed border is drawn inside, against the bounds of the frame itself:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZyYp0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><em>Note: The (shadowed) border is drawn inside the frame against it's bounds, instead of outside the frame.</em></p>

<p>It doesn't matter what kind of border is used, all of them are drawn inside the <code>JFrame</code> itself.</p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> Is it possible to draw any border around the frame, not just inside against the bounds of the frame?</p>

<hr>

<p>One way that could be used to solve this problem, is to create a different undecorated full screen window which is transparent, the normal window is put on top of this one. This full screen window is used to draw the shadow on, so the shadow doesn't need to be drawn in the frame itself. This is a solution to get a similar result, this is <strong>not</strong> what I would like though. I want to draw a border outside the frame. These kind of solutions usually cause other problems.</p>

<p>It has a property called <code>currentLevel</code>, of type <code>NSString</code>.</p>

<p>I'm able to retrieve the property from the child View Controllers with the following: </p>

<pre><code>[(CustomNavigationController *)self.navigationController currentLevel];
</code></pre>

<p>However, the currentLevel always returns <code>(null)</code>.</p>

<p>I've referenced a setter method in my view controllers which increments it:</p>

<pre><code>[(CustomNavigationController *)self.navigationController setCurrentLevel:@""Level 5""];
NSLog(@""%@"",[(CustomNavigationController *)self.navigationController currentLevel]);
//returns Level 5
</code></pre>

<p>However, when a new view controller is pushed onto the stack, or popped from the stack, my original line in the <code>viewDidLoad</code> method returns <code>(null)</code>.</p>

<p>There's going to be a particular type of <code>ViewController</code> contained within my <code>CustomNavigationController</code>. This View Controller depends on knowing what level it's on. I have logic to return a particular result depending on what level the user is currently viewing on the <code>CustomNavigationController</code>.</p>

"30757344","1","","","2015-06-10 13:10:11","","0","115","<p>We're developing a SaaS solution for several consumers. This solution is based on Spring, Wicket and Hibernate. Our 
database contains data from several customers. We've decided to model the database as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>public<br>
<em>Shared data between all customers, for example user accounts as we do not know which customer a user belongs to</em></li>
<li>customer_1</li>
<li>customer_2</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>To work with this setup we use a multi-tenancy setup with the following TenantIdentifierResolver:</p>

<pre><code>public class TenantProviderImpl implements CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver {
    private static final ThreadLocal&lt;String&gt; tenant = new ThreadLocal&lt;&gt;();

    public static void setTenant(String tenant){
        TenantProviderImpl.tenant.set(tenant);
    }

    @Override
    public String resolveCurrentTenantIdentifier() {
        return tenant.get();
    }

    @Override
    public boolean validateExistingCurrentSessions() {
        return false;
    }

    /**
     * Initialize a tenant by storing the tenant identifier in both the HTTP session and the ThreadLocal
     *
     * @param   String  tenant  Tenant identifier to be stored
     */
    public static void initTenant(String tenant) {
        HttpServletRequest req = ((ServletWebRequest) RequestCycle.get().getRequest()).getContainerRequest();
        req.getSession().setAttribute(""tenant"", tenant);
        TenantProviderImpl.setTenant(tenant);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>initTenant</code> method is called by a servlet filter for every request. This filter is processed before a connection
is opened to the database.</p>

<p>We've also implemented a <code>AbstractDataSourceBasedMultiTenantConnectionProviderImpl</code> which is set as our
<code>hibernate.multi_tenant_connection_provider</code>. It issues a <code>SET search_path</code> query before every request. This works like charm for requests passing through the servlet filter described above.</p>

<p>And now for our real problem: We've got some entrypoints into our application which do not pass the servlet filter,
for instance some SOAP-endpoints. There are also timed jobs that are executed which do not pass the servlet filter.
This proves to be a problem. </p>

<p>The Job/Endpoint receives a value somehow which can be used to identify which customer should be associated with the 
Job/Endpoint-request. This unique value is often mapped in our <code>public</code> database schema. Thus, we need to query the 
database before we know which customer is associated. Spring therefore initializes a complete Hibernate session. This 
session has our default tenant ID and is not mapped to a specific customer. However, after we've resolved the unique
value to a customer we want the session to change the tenant identifier. This seems to not be supported though, there
is no such thing as a <code>HibernateSession.setTenantIdentifier(String)</code> whereas there is a 
<code>SharedSessionContract.getTenantIdentifier()</code>.</p>

<p>We thought we had a solution in the following method:</p>

<pre><code>org.hibernate.SessionFactory sessionFactory = getSessionFactory();
org.hibernate.Session session = null;
try
{
    session = getSession();
    if (session != null)
    {
       if(session.isDirty())
       {
          session.flush();
       }
       if(!session.getTransaction().wasCommitted())
       {
          session.getTransaction().commit();
       }

       session.disconnect();
       session.close();
       TransactionSynchronizationManager.unbindResource(sessionFactory);
    }
}
catch (HibernateException e)
{
    // NO-OP, apparently there was no session yet
}
TenantProviderImpl.setTenant(tenant);
session = sessionFactory.openSession();
TransactionSynchronizationManager.bindResource(sessionFactory, new SessionHolder(session));
return session;
</code></pre>

<p>This method however does not seem to work in the context of a Job/Endpoint and leads to <code>HibernateException</code> such as
""Session is closed!"" or ""Transaction not succesfully started"".</p>

<p>We're a bit lost as we've been trying to find a solution for quite a while now. Is there something we've misunderstood?
Something we've misinterpreted? How can we fix the problem above?</p>

<p>Recap: <code>HibernateSession</code>-s not created by a user request but rather by a timed job or such do not pass our servlet
filter and thus have no associated tenant identifier before the Hibernate session is started. They have unique values
which we can translate to a tenant identifier by querying the database though. How can we tell an existing Hibernate
session to alter it's tenant identifier and thus issue a new <code>SET search_path</code> statement?</p>

<p>This is essentially what I would like to accomplish, for testing before I apply it on a larger scale.  I want the website to be able to send a value (int) from the website to the getData() method in the web service (auto generated method) and return its result (string) back to the website.</p>

<p><strong>This is my setup for the Website/IIS 7/WCF:</strong></p>

<p>Steps for creating website and service via VS 2010 (.NET 4.0)
Website:</p>

<pre><code>File &gt; New Website
I did not change anything on the default website template
Build &gt; Publish Web Site
  Set target location to specific folder
  Other settings unchanged
</code></pre>

<p>IIS Settings:</p>

<pre><code>Connections - Right Click &gt; Add Web Site
  Specified a site name
  Specified physical path
  Connect As:  Set the username/password
  Binding Default (http port 80)
Connections - Right Click on Default Web Site &gt; Manage Web Site &gt; Stop
...So as not to end up with two websites on conflicting port
Edit Permissions &gt; Add user ""Everyone""
MyNewSite &gt; Manage Website &gt; Start
...Clicked Browse Web Site &gt; Brows *.80 (http)
</code></pre>

<p>And the website ran just fine, I was able to access it locally and through vpn with the IP address.</p>

<p>WCFService:</p>

<pre><code>File &gt; New Project &gt; WCF Service Application
...I did not change any of the default settings in the WCF service
</code></pre>

<p>I ran WCF service as Admin, and it loaded the little test app where you can type in a value to the getData() method and it returns ""You typed {some_number}"".</p>

<p>So as far as I know - everything is working with the website and the wcf service.  I tried also right clicking on the website in VS, and Add Service Reference and it was able to detect the WCF service....  however, I dont know that I should need to add a reference but simply connect to the WCF like I do to a database via a connection string of sorts.</p>

<p>I found this related to licensing in the LogCat right after the app tried to download Expansion files.</p>

<p>When the Expansion file is not present on the device, the download bar is at 0/100 for a few seconds and then it says that it didn't find the resources and downlaod failed.</p>

<p>Could someone please help me and let me know where I went wrong?</p>

Basically I am listening for touch events, which selects a circle and lets a user drag around to control the location/radius of the circle. I also have a menu option to ""add a new circle"" which changes the drag event to add a new circle to view. This keeps throwing a force close though when I test it. I do not know how to see what is causing the force close (sorry I am a newb who happens to be good at hacking things apart and making them work). Could someone please take a look at this, or point me in the direction of debugging this correctly?</p>

<p>I think it might have something to do with the new circle being created inside the view that is currently in focus? If that makes any sense.</p>

<p>Here is my code... initial values are coming from a previous activity (this is not where the problem lies though, the problem is in my TouchEventListener).</p>

<p>Here's the question upfront (read on for context):</p>

<p>When my application launches using the .xib set in the Main Interface field under the deployment info of my apps target, <strong>why does the AppDelegate get instantiated after the ViewControllers?</strong></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Context</strong> (no pun intended):</p>

<p>The reason I ask is because I'm using Core Data (spare me any heckling for this decision), and typically you keep a pointer to the MOC (Managed Object Context) in AppDelegate. One of my controllers is trying to get this MOC instance variable but the AppDelegate instance isn't around yet and therefore my app doesn't present data just after launch.</p>

<p>The AppDelegate and the two ViewControllers are in the .xib. The VCs are hooked to views inside a split view. They're trying to use the MOC in viewDidLoad to make queries. They are accessing the AppDelegate like this:</p>

<pre><code>let delegate = NSApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as AppDelegate
let moc = delegate.managedObjectContext
</code></pre>

<p>This will crash as the <code>.delegate</code> property of the <code>sharedApplication()</code> returns nil.</p>

<p>I tried making an NSWindowController from the .xib in <code>applicationDidFinishLaunching</code> and removing the .xib from the Main Interface field, but then <code>applicationDidFinishLaunching</code> doesn't get called at all.</p>

<p>I've ensured that all the connections in IB for from the Application and the Files Owner (NSApplcation) delegate IBOutlets to the AppDelegate have been made.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> - 31/03/15</p>

<p>Stephen Darlington's answer below offers a good solution for my/this case. And as I understand it's actually better to setup the MOC in the way he's suggested.</p>

<p>If a correct answer arrives that explains why the AppDelegate is being instantiated at some later time in the launch process, I'll mark it correct instead of Stephen's. Thanks Stephen!</p>

I have successfully loaded each with the data from the DB using a DataAdapter and then I tried simply filling the DGVs using for loops.  Each method took roughly the same amount of time.  The first time the data is filled into the DGVs it takes too long (7+ mins), and then the subsequent times the time is much more reasonable (~30 secs). So my question is, what is the best way to load a DGV with a large amount of data that will take on average &lt;= 1 min?

<p>I am using a struct to reduce the scope of Baz enum values as well as show there are a group of related values.</p>

<p>My objective is to assign a value from an enum type to a variable. Using the class definition above, one can do this:</p>

<pre><code>Fii::Foo::Bar::Baz myValue = Fii::Foo::Bar::BAZ1 (Works in both C++98 and C++11)
</code></pre>

<p>However, I feel that:</p>

<ul>
<li>At first glance, <em>myValue</em> seems to be initialized as a <em>Fii::Foo::Bar</em> but this is just because enum are a hack to group related constants in the parent (<em>Bar</em> in this case)</li>

<pre><code>namespace Fii

            BAZ1,
            BAZ2, 
            BAZ3
        };
    };
};

<p>Using this new class definition, one can do this:</p>

<pre><code>Fii::Foo::Baz myValue = Fii::Foo::Baz::BAZ1 (Works in C++11 only)
Fii::Foo::Baz myValue = Fii::Foo::BAZ1 (Should work on C++98 and C++11 - not tested)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Q1) Why is <em>Fii::Foo::Bar::Baz myValue = Fii::Foo::Baz::BAZ1</em> only working on C++11 ?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q2) In C++98, is there a way to write <em>Fii::Foo::Baz myValue = Fii::Foo::Baz::BAZ1</em> ? You are allowed to make any changes you like in the class definition.</strong></p>

However reading Chapter 9 - <a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/practical-building-a-unit-test-framework.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Practical: Building a Unit Test Framework</a> - from the book Practical Common Lisp I was introduced to the below macro whose purpose was to get rid of the duplication of the test case expression, with its attendant risk of mislabeling of results.  </p>

<pre><code>;; Function defintion. 

(defun report-result (result form)
  (format t ""~:[FAIL~;pass~] ... ~a~%"" result form))

;; Macro Definition

(defmacro check (form)
  `(report-result ,form ',form))

<p>OK, I understand its purpose but I could have done it using a function instead of a macro, for instance:</p>

<pre><code>(setf unevaluated.form '(= 2 (+ 2 3)))

(defun my-func (unevaluated.form)
  (report-result (eval unevaluated.form) unevaluated.form))

<p>The following is a way to test this function:</p>

<pre><code>int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
    const double arr[] = {-3.0000000000000000, -2.5714285714285716, -2.1428571428571432,
                      -1.7142857142857146, -1.2857142857142860, -0.85714285714285743,
                      -0.42857142857142888, -3.3306690738754696e-016, 0.42857142857142821,
                      0.85714285714285676, 1.2857142857142854, 1.7142857142857140,

    size_t index = findInArray(arr, 15, 0.0);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Index is: "" &lt;&lt; index &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I change the if-clause (8% of the time spent here) to use the less-than comparison, there is no noticeable performance improvement:</p>

<pre><code>if (!(_valToFind &lt;  _sortedArr[midIndex]) == isAscending)
</code></pre>

<p>The only difference in the disassembly with this change was the use of 'ja' rather than jb.</p>

<p>Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Goal: push out update, with active users, keep integrity while upgrading.</p>

<p>I've sifted through all the docs I can find.  However the core details seem to be missing or I'm blatantly overlooking them.  When Azure receives an update request via FTP/git/tfs, how does it process the update?  What does it do with active users?  For example, does it freeze incoming requests to all instances, let items already processing finish, upgrade/replace each instance, let EF migrations process, then let traffics start again?  If it upgrades/refreshes all instances simultaneously, how does it ensure EF migrations run only once?  If it refreshes instances live in a rolling upgrade process (upgrade 1 at a time with no inbound traffic freeze), how could it ensure integrity since instances in the older state would/could potentially break?</p>

<p>The main question, what is the real process after it receives the request to update?  What are the recommendations for updating a live website?</p>

<p>So from <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/ref/contrib/formtools/form-wizard/"" rel=""nofollow"">django-docs</a> i can do it like this:</p>

<p><strong>forms.py:</strong></p>

        # Send the signup complete signal

        if request.user.is_authenticated():
            logout(request)
        return redirect(redirect_to)

if not extra_context: extra_context = dict()

In short, this stage is about translating large IDs to small local indices that subsequent stages use (so here in this stage I relly need to deal with 64 bit keys once, and can't use 32 bit keys). </p>

<p>I've experimented long to find a hash function that works fast on both 32 bit and 64 bit arm architectures (iOS and Android smartphones). Naturally, on 32 bit devices hashing of 64 bit keys is much slower than hashing 32 bit keys (almost 10 times in my test case). </p>

<p>I'm now very confident with the hash I found here on SO, which outperforms the MurmurHash3 32 bit finalizer in my case (with some more collissions, but doesn't matter in my case):
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/12996028/1708349"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/12996028/1708349</a></p>

<p>All works fine and well for now, but here s the catch: I naively assign the 64 bit key to an int32_t type before hashing it - this is done for performance reasons for the 32 bit platforms. This seems to work, large data is wrapped around. But the catch is of course that this behavior is not defined. </p>

<p><strong>So, my question is: What is the best (e.g. defined compiler behavior) to assign an int64_t type to an int32_t type, so it wraps around - and is for example not just assigned the lower 32 bit of the 64 bit int?</strong></p>

<p>This is my actual hash function:</p>

<pre><code>inline int32_t hash2(int64_t k) {
#pragma clang diagnostic push
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored ""-Wconversion""
    int32_t x = k;
#pragma clang diagnostic pop
    x = ((x &gt;&gt; 16) ^ x) * 0x45d9f3b;
    x = ((x &gt;&gt; 16) ^ x) * 0x45d9f3b;
    x = ((x &gt;&gt; 16) ^ x);

    return x;
}

<ul>
<li>first view: it should show the user's location (default blue dot) and load data from a server.</li>
<li>second view: it should show the user's location (my custom pin with annotation and callout). the user can tap the callout and submit data about the current location.</li>

<p>I started by using MKMapView's showsUserLocation.
Then I read that it's better to use a CLLocationManager singleton instance, so I followed this blog post roughly: <a href=""http://jinru.wordpress.com/2010/08/15/singletons-in-objective-c-an-example-of-cllocationmanager/"">http://jinru.wordpress.com/2010/08/15/singletons-in-objective-c-an-example-of-cllocationmanager/</a></p>

<p>Now this pretty much works, but I'm wondering if it's the correct way to do things.</p>

<p>Also, I couldn't find a way to show the default blue dot instead of a custom pin. I read that I should use MKMapView's showsUserLocation, but wouldn't that create another instance of CLLocationManager?</p>

I want to ensure that all links the user enters have their <code>target=""_blank""</code>. I thought I'd need to do two regex checks: one to replace any <code>target=""...""</code> to <code>target=""_blank""</code>, and another to just insert target attribute where target attribute doesn't exist. I'm not making much progress:</p>

<pre><code>// where target attribute doesn't exist, add it
preg_replace(""/&lt;a(\s*(?!target)([\w\-])+=([\\""\'])[^\\""\']+\3)*\s*\/?&gt;/"", ""&lt;a target=""_blank""$1&gt;"", $input_lines);
</code></pre>

<p>This works in this simple case:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#""&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; ---&gt; &lt;a target=""_blank"" href=""#""&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It does not work for <code>&lt;a href=""#"" alt=""hello""&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;</code>, I'm not sure why but then I don't normally do things this challenging with regular expressions.</p>

<p>Also, how would I replace existing <code>target=""...""</code> (e.g. <code>target=""_parent</code>"") with strictly <code>target=""_blank</code>""?</p>

I've tested the queries on the MySQL server and they are correct, but when I run them in the app they all return <em>exactly one row</em>, when in reality each time they are run winScheduleQuery and lossScheduleQuery should each be returning anywhere from 0 to 10 rows or so, this for each row of the teamQuery result.

<p>The SQLClient class splits the rows it receives from the servlet with the newline character (\n), which is why I split lossResult, winResult and teamResult with '\n' to divide the query result into rows. The log reports ""NUMBER_OF_COACHES"" to be correct, so teamQuery is working correctly, it's lossScheduleQuery and winScheduleQuery which are the problem. The Log also reports winScheduleQuery and lossScheduleQuery as exactly what I thought they should be. </p>

<p>This works fine so far, but there's a problem and i have no idea how to solve it. Let's assume, that i have this array structure:</p>

    [""alpha3""]=&gt;
        string(3) ""and""

}
</code></pre>

<p>I can use the method above to find this array by <code>alpha2 = ad</code> for example. But what i need is the possibility to search for <code>eur IN currencies</code> for example.</p>

<p>Using this does not work:</p>

<pre><code>getCountryDataByVal($array, 'currencies', 'eur');
</code></pre>

<p>because <code>eur</code> is not the value of the key <code>currencies</code>, but it's the value of a subkey.</p>

<p>Any idea, how i have to extend the method above to achieve this?</p>

I want to be able to set each and every property so I derived from that control and I have created a custom control. I also did the same thing for it's items component.</p>

<pre><code>public class RadComboBoxItem : ListBoxItem
{

    ...

    public bool IsHighlighted
{
    get
    {
        return (bool)GetValue(IsHighlightedProperty);
    }
    protected set
    {
        this.SetValue(IsHighlightedPropertyKey, value);
    }
}

    ...

}

public class MyCustomComboBoxItem : RadComboBoxItem 
{
    public void HighlightItem(bool _default)
    {
        this.IsHighlighted = _default;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my case I have a list of RadComboBoxItems and I want to create a new list of type MyCustomComboBoxItem, so I can access the setter for each item from the first list based on the data:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class MainPage : UserControl
{
    public MainPage()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        ...

        foreach (RadComboBoxItem _item in _listOfRadComboBoxItems)
        {
            MyCustomComboBoxItem _customCBI = new MyCustomComboBoxItem();
            _customCBI.Load(_customCBI.GetType(), _item, true);
            _listOfCustomCBI.Add(_newB2);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I found another post with an explanation on what I am trying to do but my case is a little different and I borrowed the Load method from here:</p>

            if (property.CanWrite &amp;&amp; property.CanRead)
            {
                if (!deep || property.PropertyType.IsPrimitive || property.PropertyType == typeof(String))

<p><strong>Recap:</strong> What I am trying to do here is create a custom ComboBox from Telerik's RadComboBox. This has ComboBoxItems that have the IsHighlighted dependency property setter protected. I created MyCustomComboBoxItem to circumvent this limitation but I can't get to copy the RadComboBoxItem into MyCustomComboBoxItem.</p>

<p><strong>Reason:</strong> I want to be able to set it, so I can help the user in a better experience.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>But unfortunately different subclasses need to take in different number of arguments for <code>setHashcode</code>, e.g., class B might compute hashcode using two of its fields and class C might need three, but since the call to super has to be the first line in B's constructor this scheme won't work.

<p>I'm trying to get data from a table. This isn't a really table but only a view.
When I load a query with LINQ,</p>

<pre><code>var result = from u in dbClienti.clienti
             select u;

return result.ToList()
</code></pre>

<p>I receive the correct number of results (the same that i receive with the same query in SQL Server Management studio), but with wrong fields: the first one is replicated several times, the second one the same, etc.</p>

<p>Why is it working in this way? Are there any problems on Entity Frameworks with database's views?</p>

<p>How to get value selected in  @Html.DropDownListFor inside the view and pass it to action in OTHER controller in my case?</p>

<hr>

<p>If it is not a problem I feel better with java script(I understand better what is going on).</p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>This is solution(mine) which lacks getting value from dropdown in java script function.</p>

<p>The dropdown list:</p>

<pre><code>    @Html.DropDownListFor(m =&gt; m.CallsToMake, new SelectList(Model.CallsToMake.OrderByDescending(call =&gt; call.TimeStamp), null), new { @class = ""btn btn-default dropdown-toggle"", style = ""width: 500px;"" })
</code></pre>

<p>The button when clicked <code>javascript:FetchCall()</code> is invoked:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""button"" id=""FetchCallButton"" value=""Fetch call"" onclick=""javascript:FetchCall()"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The JavaScript function:</p>

<pre><code> function FetchCall() {
        var url = '@Url.Action(""FetchCall, ""Person"")';  
        $.post(url, { callToMakeId: SELECTED_CALL_IN_DROPDOWN_ID_HOW_TO_GET_IT}, function (data) {
            alert('YES');
        });
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The action method in <code>PersonController</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult FetchCall(int callToMakeId) {...}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How to get selected <code>call.Id</code> in the java script function?</p>

<hr>

<h2>EDIT 2</h2>

<p>Thanks to Tommy's solution I've been able to read selection in dropdown list. The problem is that I get exacly what is written in the dropdown list which is result from <code>ToString()</code> inside <code>CallToMake</code> class. </p>

<p>function:</p>

<pre><code>function FetchCall() {
    alert($(""#CallsToMake"").val());
    var url = '@Url.Action(""FetchCall"", ""Person"")';
    $.post(url, { callToMakeId: $(""#CallsToMake"").val() }, function (data) {
        alert('YES');
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>I show in image below contents of the drop down and alert <code>alert($(""#CallsToMake"").val());</code>:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/aHfcB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The only solution that comes to my mind is to display <code>id</code> of the call in the dropdown list and then cut it out in the controller action. It sounds bad, isn't it?</p>

<h2>EDIT 3 </h2>

<p>The list finally looks like:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.DropDownListFor(m =&gt; m.CallsToMake, new SelectList(Model.CallsToMake.OrderByDescending(call =&gt; call.TimeStamp), ""Id"",""Id""), new { @class = ""btn btn-default dropdown-toggle"", style = ""width: 500px;"" })
</code></pre>

<p>java script:</p>

<pre><code>    function FetchCall() {
        alert($(""#CallsToMake"").val());
        var url = '@Url.Action(""FetchCall"", ""Person"")';
        $.post(url, { callToMakeId: $(""#CallsToMake"").val() }, function (data) {
            alert('YES');
        });
    }
=
</code></pre>

<p>and the Action method</p>

<pre><code> public ActionResult FetchCall(int callToMakeId) {
            CallToMake callToMake = db.CallsToMake.Find(callToMakeId);
            int idPersonToCall = callToMake.Callee.Id;
            db.CallsToMake.Remove(callToMake);
            db.SaveChanges();
            Debug.WriteLine(""I AM HERE"");
            return RedirectToAction(""Details"", new { id = idPersonToCall });
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Action method is being invoked but I am not redirected anywhere. Method just runs and that is all.</p>

<pre><code>http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20yahoo.finance.quotes%20where%20symbol%20in%20%28%22AAPL%22%29&amp;env=store://datatables.org/alltableswithkeys

<p>And these two are the problems with loading the XML into an XML Document in code. I tried removing these two things and then it works, with them it does not.</p>

<p>The first line, I must remove the 'yahoo:' otherwise it will not work</p>

<p>Then I must also remove the TickerTrend element from the XML</p>

<p>After these two are removed/fixed, i can load the XML into an XML Document in my code.</p>

<p>I am not including any code since I am using Dexterity and the loading code is working fine, only the actual XML is not ok. I tried two validators and one throws errors while the other doesn't. </p>

<p>Any ideas what I can do? Instead of saving to an XML file and then loading should I just load straight from the URL?</p>

<p>Or how can I automatically remove the 'yahoo:' each time the file is saved? I know I can get rid of the <code>&lt;TickerTrend&gt;</code> by specifying only elements I want int the URL but not sure how to remove the 'yahoo:'</p>

I think it has something to do with my implementation. Below is code from my show page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Music Videos&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;iframe src=""http://player.vimeo.com/video/#{music_video.url_id}"" width=""100%""

&lt;% @music_video.comments.each do |comment| %&gt;

&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I believe there may be a problem with the iframe src url but i don't think that I'm seeing it. Essentially my rails app works in the way that all you need to do is to copy paste the video id and it will append itself to the iframe src url using string interpolation. It makes perfect sense to me but the video refuses to play. The website on vimeo <a href=""http://developer.vimeo.com/player/embedding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.vimeo.com/player/embedding</a> makes the embed instructions crystal clear, so I'm thinking that the string interpolation is wrong somehow. I could use a fresh pair of eyes. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>what do you SQL experts recommend to substitute a couple of MS Access databases by s.th. more modern like JAVA / Oracle or JAVA / mySQL?
The databases are small, not more than a few thousand records each. so there is no need for performance speed on the DB side.
But all of the MS Access stuff has complex forms with colors (for information purposes), details, nested sub-forms and a lot of nested queries.
Since MS Access is hard to debug and misses modern development tools as those in Eclipse I think about a redesign of the old stuff.
Said with other words, what is the best way to substitute especially forms?
Is Java Swing a good library to rebuild all the form stuff?
Or should I stay with the old stuff?</p>

"14282828","1","","","2013-01-11 16:50:22","","3","498","<p>Due to the number of products we build/maintain, we have a fairly complex dll structure (>100 assemblies). We are in the process of installing TFS 2012. We currently use NuGet to manage references to external dlls. </p>

<p>It appears that Nuget could be an answer for managing our internal dlls. </p>

<p>Here is a sample of our structure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Framework.dll</li>
<li>Business.dll
<ul>
<li>references: Framework.dll</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Business.X.dll
<ul>
<li>references: Framework.dll</li>
<li>references: Business.dll</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Application.X.dll
<ul>
<li>refs: Framework.dll</li>
<li>refs: Business.X.dll</li>
<li>refs: Business.dll</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>To accomplish this with NuGet, I created a nuget spec/package for each assembly. Each package then includes its dependent pacakge(s).</p>

<ul>
<li>Framework.1.0.nupkg</li>
<li>Business.1.0.nupkg
<ul>
<li>depends on: Framework</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Business.X.1.0.nupkg
<ul>
<li>depends on: Framework, Business</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Application.X.1.0.nupkg
<ul>
<li>depends on: Framework, Business, Business.X</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>1) I created the Framework VS project, built it, and packaged it to Framework.1.0.nupkg
2) I opened the Business VS project and added a reference to Framework.dll by installing the Framework.1.0.nupkg
3) I then built and packaged the Business VS project as Business.1.0.nupkg
4) I repeated this process for each assembly (FYI, I used NuGetter to automated this)</p>

<p>I'm having trouble reconciling the difference between a local developer machine and the build server.</p>

<p>Here is my understanding: </p>

<ol>
<li>I don't need to store the final assembly in TFS because of NuGet's package restore feature.</li>
<li>Instead of referencing an assembly, the reference is added using NuGet. For example, in the Business VS project, the Framework assembly is added from the the Nuget Framework.1.0 package.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, this makes it difficult for assembly developers to build/test new features. How should a developer working on the Business and Business.X assemblies test a feature locally (on their own machine) without removing/readding references. This is necessary because Business.X references Business that was packaged, not the locally built Business.dll. </p>

<p>My goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a build server to produce versioned, shared assemblies</li>
<li>Allow consumer applications to add references to these assemblies</li>
<li>Allow developers of shared assemblies to easy compile/test locally before requiring server builds</li>
</ol>

<p>I think Nuget works well for #1 and #2, but I can't seem to accomplish #3. Is there a better way to do this?</p>

<p>Thanks for any info/pointers!</p>

By that, I mean either the server or the device can send a message at any time. Briefly saying I want to let the user leave the feedback to another user. Something like leaving the feedbacks for example on ebay. Sending a data from android to the server is common and I understand that I can make a http request to run a php script, query a database and send back the response via a JSON object to android device. I would like to inform another user that he received the new feedback via the notifiactions. I know that I could periodically poll the server but I'm trying to avoid this as possible. I have read about Google Cloud Messaging. I'm wondering if there is another simpler or better approach to acheive this task? Please advice. Thank you.</p>

<pre><code>make -f makefile.mingw

<p>This should be all well and good standard procedure. However, I can't make sense of the output from the command:</p>

<p>Now... at this point, I'm really confused. Because according to the title of the command prompt window, I'm still INSIDE the make command. So, I type ""exit"" at the ""prompt""</p>

<pre><code>g++ -c -o obj\gcc_static_rel\muParser_lib_muParser.o -DNDEBUG -O2     -D_WIN32 -     I..\include   -MTobj\gcc_static_rel\muParser_lib_muParser.o -  MFobj\gcc_static_rel\muParser_lib_muParser.o.d -MD -MP ../src/muParser.cpp

<p>The command appears to ""step"" through it's next function. I continue to type exit at the ""prompt"" and the command appears to continue stepping until it's done. However, after exiting completely, I can't see any results and it appears nothing's actually been done.</p>

<p>Also, this doesn't have anything to do with the command prompt. I even wrote a python script to cd into the directory and call make, and the output still displayed a windows-style command prompt - complete with the copyright Microsoft line etc., and waited for an input. I typed exit the same way until the process exited back to python. </p>

<p>Now, I might be going insane, but I'm really confused. Asking on the forums yielded no help, the only response is that ""the windows build should be working.""</p>

<p>Does anyone know what's going on???</p>

<li>Zoom the image;</li>
<li>Move the image.</li>

<p>Rotate the image with the help of the community I could do.</p>

<p>Now I'm trying to zoom the picture, but she has to keep the rotated image, if I have turned it.</p>

<p>And I need to move the image with the mouse while keeping the features of zoom and rotate if it is rotated.</p>

Unfortunately, the documentation around it is kinda sparse, but I've managed to get some info from various blog posts, most of them 2 years + old. I managed to setup the routing pretty quickly, BUT I realized that Monorail's routing engine confuses .jpeg files as controller/action requests WHEN they are not found.</p>

<p>The webconfig file is pretty standard:</p>

            RoutingModuleEx.Engine.Add(
                new PatternRoute(""&lt;controller&gt;/[action]""));

<p>The error itself says it pretty clearly:</p>

<p>though the output value of cmdPath is <code>C:\Windows\system32\du.exe</code>!</p>

<p>and of course, if I just type the contents of <code>cmdPath</code> into a command prompt, it runs du.exe and gives me the usage info.</p>

<p>Also, if I replace the command path with just ""du.exe"", and put the du.exe in the working directory, all works fine. But I want to reference the one in the system location.</p>

<p>So, what is going on? As far as I can tell, I have a legitimate file specifier, but why won't <code>Process.Start()</code> execute it? This basic code is also executing several other programs and getting their output. The others all work fine, though du.exe is different from them in that it's in the system32 directory. Does that have something to do with it?</p>

My problem here is if I'm adding a large <code>DataSet</code> (say 2000 items) to a bound <code>DataGridView</code>, it takes 5-8 seconds for the grid to populate and during that 5-8 seconds the whole GUI is locked.  How can I update the <code>DataGridView</code> such that it doesn't lock the user interface?</p>

<p>To be clear, the problem isn't that I'm doing a slow query to a database and the UI is blocking on that, I already have the <code>DataSet object[]</code> and adding the array of objects to a <code>BindingList&lt;object&gt;</code> which the <code>DataGrid</code> is bound to so:</p>

<pre><code>BindingList&lt;object&gt; dataProvider = new BindingList&lt;object&gt;();
DataGridView gridView = new DataGridView();
gridView.DataSource = dataProvider;

// ...stuff happens...

object[] source = dataSet; //of 2000 items
foreach (object item in source) {  //this foreach blocks
    dataProvider.Add(item);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I tried various things (that I knew wouldn't work but figured I'd see) like creating a delegate that did the <code>dataProvider.Add()</code>, but that didn't matter since it still had to happen on the control thread.</p>

<p>A couple good suggestions revolved around building the <code>BindingList</code> first and then setting the <code>gridView.DataSource</code>.  While this works (it updates the grid instantly), the only way I see to add more data is to create another new <code>BindingList</code>, do a <code>gridView.DataSource.copyTo()</code> (to get the existing data) and add the new data on top of that, then set the <code>gridView.DataSource</code> to the new <code>BindingList</code>. This won't work for me since the objects in my list are not static, they are each uploading data to a server asynchronously, and copying them to a new <code>BindingList</code> would cause problems.</p>

<p>but its creating some false results.
im using jqueryUIs resizeable to change the height of the elements and want to sort them 
by height after resizing.</p>

<p>can i access the style.height attribute somehow?
maybe another sorting plugin or a sort script will do that better?</p>

<p><strong>a solution would be a special attribute called heightvalue in  which is set to the 
height of the element. but how can i change the jqueryUI resizable that it would add me a 
value to that attribute?</strong></p>

<p>Oracle has an instruction on how to upgrade the version of Jersey JAX-RS RI :

I went through it a couple of times and this feels like it's the only way I can write something like this. The aim of the function is to replace the JavaScript <code>.split()</code> function; as when using that function with a limit doesn't include the last part of the array in the returning array. EG:</p>

<pre><code>var str = ""Test split string with limit"";
var out = str.split(' ', 2);
</code></pre>

<p>The array <code>out</code> will contain: [<code>Test</code>, <code>split</code>]. I want it to contain: [<code>Test</code>, <code>split</code>, <code>string with limit</code>].</p>

<p>I know there are pure JS ways to do this however I find them hacky and possibly slower(?) than a single C++ bind call.</p>

<p>Here's my function:</p>

<pre><code>/**

 * @param input
 * @param delim

    unsigned int inputLen = input.length();

    // Declare a temporary array to shove into the return later
    std::vector&lt;char*&gt; tmp;
    tmp.reserve(limit);

    unsigned int delimlen = delim.length();
    char* cp = (char*) malloc(inputLen);
    char* cursor = cp + inputLen; // Cursor

    // Copy the haystack into a modifyable char ptr
    memset(cp + inputLen, 0x00, 1);
    memcpy(cp, input.c_str(), inputLen);

    unsigned int arrayIndex = 0;
    for(unsigned int i=0;i&lt;limit;i++)
    {

<p>If you are wondering: The variable <code>cpp</code> is there so I can delete the character pointer after I am done (As calling v8's <code>String::NewFromUtf8()</code> function copies the string) and I modify the <code>cp</code> pointer during the process of the function.</p>

<p>The only complication is that the top date must always be visible; it cannot scroll off the screen. Except when the next date reaches the top, it must now become the top date and remain visible until the next date in the sequence displaces it.</p>

<p>So for my design I have a RelativeLayout with two child views: A TextView and a ListView</p>

<pre><code>&lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    xmlns:tools=""http://schemas.android.com/tools""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:background=""#F0F1F3""
    tools:context="".MyAppActivity"" &gt;

    &lt;TextView …/&gt;
    &lt;ListView … /&gt;
&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then within <code>MyAppActivity.java</code> I use <code>setOnScrollListener</code> to track scrolling so to know when to set the value in my TextView to the top date. By using the TextView, I ensure that the top date is always visible.</p>

<p>But the problem is as follows. If the current top date is date1 and the next date is date2. When date2 is about to become the top date: I need to have an animation of some sort, showing date2 pushing date1 out of the way to become the top date.</p>

<p>I have been trying a number of stuff, such as deleting date2 when it becomes <code>firstVisibleItem</code> as I replace the value of the TextView from that of date1 to that of date2. But that approach is daunting as, if the user scrolls back he is supposed to see the previous date; etc. etc.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how I might get date2 to displace date1 by pushing it out of the way?</p>

<p>OR BETTER YET:</p>

<p>Is there a way to tell a listView to keep a certain item at the top of the visible items?</p>

<p>This is a question about best practices regarding a new meaning of the delete operator introduced with C++11 when applied to a child class overriding an inherited parent's virtual method.
<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Background:</B></p>

<p>Per the standard, the first use case cited is to explicitly disallow calling functions for certain types where conversions would otherwise be implicit such as the example from §8.4.3 of the latest <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3242.pdf"">C++11 standard draft</a>:</p>

<pre><code>struct sometype {
    sometype() = delete; // OK, but redundant
    some_type(std::intmax_t) = delete;
    some_type(double);
};
</code></pre>

<p>The above example is clear and purposeful. However, the following example where the new operator is overridden and prevented from being called by defining it as deleted started me thinking about other scenarios that I later identify in the question section (the example below is from §8.4.3 of the <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3242.pdf"">C++11 standard draft</a>):</p>

<pre><code>struct sometype {
    void *operator new(std::size_t) = delete;
    void *operator new[](std::size_t) = delete;
};
sometype *p = new sometype; // error, deleted class operator new
sometype *q = new sometype[3]; // error, deleted class operator new[]
</code></pre>

<p><BR/>
<B>Question:</B></p>

<p>By extension of this thought to inheritance, I am curious to other's thoughts regarding whether the following usage example is a clear and valid use-case or if it is an unclear abuse of the newly added feature. Please provide justification for your answer (the example that provides the most compelling reasoning will be accepted). In the example that follows, the design attempts to maintain two versions of library (the library is required to be instantiated) by having the second version of the library inherit from the first. The idea is to allow bug fixes or changes made to the first library version to automatically propagate to the second library version while allowing the second library version to focus only on its differences from the first version. To deprecate a function in the second library version, the delete operator is used to disallow a call to the overridden function:</p>

<pre><code>class LibraryVersion1 {
public:
    virtual void doSomething1() { /* does something */ }
    // many other library methods
    virtual void doSomethingN() { /* does something else */ }
};

class LibraryVersion2 : public LibraryVersion1 {
public:
    // Deprecate the doSomething1 method by disallowing it from being called
    virtual void doSomething1() override = delete;

    // Add new method definitions
    virtual void doSomethingElse() { /* does something else */ }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Though I can see many benefits to such an approach, I think I tend more toward the thought that it is an abuse of the feature. The primary pitfall I see in the above example is that the classic ""is-a"" relationship of inheritance is broken. I have read many articles that strongly recommend against any use of inheritance to express a ""sort-of-is-a"" relationship and to instead use composition with wrapper functions to clearly identify the relationships of the classes. While the following often-frowned-upon example requires more effort to implement and maintain (regarding the number of lines written for this piece of code, since every inherited function to be available publicly must be explicitly called out by the inheriting class), the use of delete as depicted above is very similar in many ways:</p>

<pre><code>class LibraryVersion1 {
public:
    virtual void doSomething1() { /* does something */ }
    virtual void doSomething2() { /* does something */ }
    // many other library methods
    virtual void doSomethingN() { /* does something */ }
};

class LibraryVersion2 : private LibraryVersion1 {
    // doSomething1 is inherited privately so other classes cannot call it
public:
    // Explicitly state which functions have not been deprecated
    using LibraryVersion1::doSomething2();
    //  ... using (many other library methods)
    using LibraryVersion1::doSomethingN();

    // Add new method definitions
    virtual void doSomethingElse() { /* does something else */ }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you in advance for your answers and further insight into this potential use-case of delete.</p>

<p>I assume this is because that now it is happy with the request but it is failing to match the users DN, for some reason.</p>

As far as I can tell the message is going in to the exchange but it's not coming out. My gut is that this has something to do with a race condition with my topic bindings or something, but I have basically no tools to inspect rabbitmq's internal state.</p>

<p>My dream tool would be something where I could essentially <code>tail -f</code> an exchange's logs and see all operations on that exchange (create, bind, unbind, publish). This might help me see exactly what rabbit is seeing and why my messages are occasionally failing to be delivered to the queue I'm expecting them too.</p>

<p>Does such a thing exist? I've played with the rabbitmqadmin plugin, but it seems way more high level than this. I've looked at rabbit's built in logging but it seems to just keep track of client connections. Is there a config file option to turn up the verbosity of that log? Or some other log file that has what I'm looking for? Clearly this level of verbosity would destroy a production cluster, but I could really use it during development. I've also contemplated writing a separate logging process to just subscribe to <code>#</code> on the topic exchange, but since part of what I'm concerned about is the timing of binding/unbinding it would be a pretty crude solution. </p>

<p>Can you achieve the same for <code>cmd.exe</code>, or as a fallback, for PowerShell? A colored prompt?</p>

<p>I don't know if it could be done in the old days before Win32 by loading <code>ANSI.SYS</code>. I think that was just to make the foreground and the background colorful. But I might be wrong. And anyway, those days are gone, and in our modern times (I know), we're using <code>cmd.exe</code>, or PowerShell.</p>

<p>I know both cmd.exe and PowerShell are capable of colored output. For cmd.exe, just run <code>color /?</code> to find out. But my question is not about the foreground and the background, that's all known to humankind - it's about just changing the prompt color for cmd.exe, probably via the <code>PROMPT</code> environment variable as via the <code>PS1</code> variable for Bash? Is it possible?</p>

<p>And no, Cygwin is not an alternative for this. I'm a Cygwin user with MinTTY and all, and I love it. But I still want my <code>cmd.exe</code> prompt colored, too.</p>

<p>Maybe it's kinda trivial, but after many years of using IntelliJ IDEA I find returning to Eclipse a little bit awkward.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Since more detailed explanation was requested, I'm doing that.</p>

<p>So, recently I was helping out some fellow Java developer and noticed he is using Eclipse w/o Sun's JDK. Since company-wide we are using only Sun's JDKs, I found it rather strange. </p>

<p>It appeared that he has only Eclipse and no additional tools for compiling java code (like javac) are required. This is because Eclipse comes bundled with its own compiler (check <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3061654/what-is-the-difference-between-javac-and-the-eclipse-compiler"">this</a> for more details). </p>

<p>By itself I find this feature quite nice, and I believe there were good reasons for that. But I would like all our company developers to use same compiler to generate java bytecode (.class files). And to run this in same JVMs. Just for sake of having as unified environment as possible and eliminating additional environment-specific issues. I have no problem with specifying JRE in Eclipse. </p>

<p>But I failed to find how to change default Java compiler to javac. On the other hand, my primary IDE IntelliJ IDEA allows do that (choose between javac, jikes or eclipse compilers). So I just wanted to know if same is possible in Eclipse or not.</p>

<p>Additionally:</p>

<ul>
<li>No, I have no real problems with Eclipse compiler as such, this is simply matter of being able to choose.</li>
<li>I know that Apache Ant and other solutions can be used to compile Java code with any compiler. But here I'm interested in Eclipse and its integrated project building (e.g. menu items under <em>Project</em> menu).</li>

<pre><code>[ a if a else ""Exception"" for a in range( 1, 10 ) ]

<p>which outputed</p>

<p><code>[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]</code></p>

<p><code>[ a if a else ""Exception"" for a in [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ] ]</code></p>

<p>I've got a closed loop system - I write the webservice and the consuming application - which is on a PDA.</p>

<p>Web service is published and for the PDA app, I use ""add new web reference"" feature in VS.</p>

<p>I can then use code like:</p>

<pre><code>AppName.com.MyDomain.WebServiceName s = new AppNamecom.MyDomain.WebServiceName();
s.SomeMethod(Param1, Param2);
</code></pre>

<p>All is well...until I discover that I need to update one of the webmethods to take say 3 parameters when I used to take 2.</p>

<p>If I change the webservice and publish, all my existing PDA's will simply fail on the call until they get the new version of PDA software. With hundreds in the field, I can't update them all at once nor do I want to require them to update all at the same time.</p>

<p>Solution 1:</p>

<p>Add a version number to the webservice method so SomeMethod now has SomeMethodV2(1,2,3)
Update PDA software to use s.SomeMethodV2</p>

<p>Solution 2:
Copy the existing ""webServiceName"" to say WebServiceNameV2, which has SomeMethod(1,2,3)
Change the PDA software to reference  AppName.com.MyDomain.WebServiceNameV2
At some point when you know that no PDA's are using V1 anymore, shut down that webservice.</p>

<p>Both of these solutions have pro's &amp; con's but i'm not convinced there are only two; there are probably more elegant ways to handle this situation ? Perhaps not by using the ""add new web reference""</p>

<p>I'm using .net 2.0 for the PDA, .net 3.5 for the webservice; c# for both. I've not looked into it yet but I don't think I can use WCF with .net 2.0 on the PDA.</p>

My biggest stumbling block is how to ""chain"" coroutines that continually consume data, update state with it, and allow that state to be used by another coroutine.</p>

<p>The observable behaviour I expect from this example program is simply to periodically report on the sum of numbers received from a subprocess. The reporting should happen at roughly the same rate the <code>Source</code> object recieves numbers from the subprocess. IO blocking in the reporting function should not block reading from the subprocess. If the reporting function blocks for longer than an iteration of reading from the subprocess, I don't care if it skips ahead or reports a bunch at once; but there should be about as many iterations of <code>reporter()</code> as there are of <code>expect_exact()</code> over a long enough timeframe.</p>

<p>This example requires <code>pexpect</code> to be installed from git; you could just as easily replace <code>run()</code> with:</p>

<pre><code>@asyncio.coroutine
def run(self):
    yield from self.flag.wait()

    while self.flag.is_set():
        value = yield from asyncio.sleep(0.5, random.choice((-1, 1)))
        self.sum += value
</code></pre>

<p>But the real subprocess I'm interested in needs to be run in a <code>pty</code>, which I think means the supplied subprocess transport/protocol framework in <code>asyncio</code> won't be sufficient for this. The point is that the source of the asynchronous activity is a coroutine that can be used with <code>yield from</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>reporter()</code> function in this example is not valid code; my problem is that I don't know what should go in there. Ideally I'd like to keep the <code>reporter()</code> code separate from <code>run()</code>; the point of this exersise is to see how to factor out more complex programs into smaller units of code using the components in <code>asyncio</code>.</p>

<p>Is there a way to structure this kind of behaviour with the <code>asyncio</code> module?</p>

<p>This is the indices, which makes up 16 tiles made of 32 triangles, I actually generate them but this is the first row:</p>

<pre><code>        Dim inasd() As Integer = {
        0, 2, 10,
        2, 10, 12,
        10, 12, 20,
        12, 20, 22,
        20, 22, 30,
        22, 30, 32
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'm trying to apply a texture to every single triangle, 1 texture per tile. 16 different textures.</p>

<p>Now my problem lies within the fact that when I use</p>

<pre><code>GL.DrawRangeElements(PrimitiveType.Triangles, 0, indices.Length - 1, 6, DrawElementsType.UnsignedShort, New IntPtr(0))
</code></pre>

<p>Rather than going along the UV data and using it like (0,1,2) (3,4,5) (6,7,8) it instead follows the index data, and grabs UV cords like (0,2,10) (2,10,12) (10,12,20) so to counter that I did this:</p>

<pre><code>        Dim UV_Data(12) As Vector2
        UV_Data(0) = New Vector2(0.0F, 1.0F)
        UV_Data(2) = New Vector2(0.0F, 0.0F)
        UV_Data(10) = New Vector2(1.0F, 1.0F)
        UV_Data(12) = New Vector2(1.0F, 0.0F)
</code></pre>

<p>This works great, on the first tile. On the second tile because it goes (10,12,20) it uses UV_Data(10) as the top left corner of the triangle which is the top right corner on the texture so it doesn't work. Is there anyway I can get rid of the indexing on the UV but not on the vertex? Because its just causing such a headache for me, otherwise what can I do? </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The vertex data and UV Data ares stored in two separate buffers like this:</p>

<pre><code>    GL.GenBuffers(1, FloatBuffer)
    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, FloatBuffer)
    GL.BufferData(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, New IntPtr(floats.Length * Vector3.SizeInBytes), floats, BufferUsageHint.StaticDraw)

    GL.GenBuffers(1, UVBuffer)
    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, UVBuffer)
    GL.BufferData(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, New IntPtr(UV_Data.Length * Vector2.SizeInBytes), UV_Data, BufferUsageHint.StaticDraw)
</code></pre>

<p>They get to the graphics card like this:</p>

<pre><code>    GL.EnableVertexAttribArray(0)
    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, FloatBuffer)
    GL.VertexAttribPointer(0, 3, VertexAttribPointerType.Float, False, 0, 0)

    GL.EnableVertexAttribArray(1)
    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, UVBuffer)
    GL.VertexAttribPointer(1, 2, VertexAttribPointerType.Float, False, 0, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>I also have the indices buffer:</p>

<pre><code>    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ElementArrayBuffer, IndicesBuffer)
</code></pre>

<p>Then drawn with the Gl.DrawRangeElements code above.</p>

<p>My vertex shader:</p>

<pre><code>#version 330 core

// Input vertex data, different for all executions of this shader.
layout(location = 0) in vec3 vertexPosition_modelspace;
layout(location = 1) in vec2 vertexUV;

// Output data ; will be interpolated for each fragment.
out vec2 UV;

// Values that stay constant for the whole mesh.

void main(){

// Output position of the vertex, in clip space : MVP * position
gl_Position.xyz = vertexPosition_modelspace;
gl_Position.w = 1;

// UV of the vertex. No special space for this one.
UV = vertexUV;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My fragment shader:</p>

<pre><code>#version 330 core

// Interpolated values from the vertex shaders
in vec2 UV;

// Ouput data
out vec3 color;

// Values that stay constant for the whole mesh.
uniform sampler2D myTextureSampler;

void main(){

// Output color = color of the texture at the specified UV
color = texture2D( myTextureSampler, UV ).rgb;
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT 2: Is it possible to edit the UV data whilst rendering for example:</p>

<pre><code>    Dim UV_Data(indices.Length) As Vector2

        UV_Data(indices(i + 3)) = New Vector2(1.0F, 0.0F)
        'GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, UVBuffer)

<p>This will result in two heads in both repos (I know it's not common to have two heads, but I'm doing this for synchornisation and it needs to be non-interactive. The heads will be merged manually from one of the repos and then the sync run again).</p>

<p>I'd like to do the same thing in Git. Eg., with no user interaction, get all of the changes into both repos, with multiple branches/heads/whatever to be merged later.
I'm trying to do this using urls in the commands, rather than adding remotes(?), as there could be a number of repos involved, and having aliases for them all will just make my script more complicated.</p>

<p>I'm currently cloning the repo using <code>git clone --bar {repo1}</code> however I'm struggling to ""update"" it. I've tried <code>get fetch {repo1}</code> but that doesn't seem to pull my changes down; <code>git log</code> still doesn't show the changeset that has been added in repo1.</p>

<p>I have two repositories (eg. BitBucket and GitHub) and want people to be able to push to either (ultimately, one will be Git, one will be Mercurial, but let's assume they're both Git for now to simplify things). I need to be able to run a script that will ""sync"" the two repos in a way that they both contain both sets of changes, and may require merging manually later.</p>

<p>Eventually, this means I can just interact with one of the repos (eg. the Mercurial one), and my script will periodically pull in Git changes which I can merge in, and then they'll be pushed back.</p>

<p>In Mercurial this is <em>trivial</em>! I just pull from both repos, and push with <code>-f/--force</code> to allow pushing multiple heads. Then anybody can clone one of the repos, merge the heads, and push back. I want to know how to do the closest similar thing in Git. It must be 100% non-interactive, and must keep both repos in a state that the process can be repeated infinitely (that means no rewriting history/changing changesets etc).</p>

<p>The view I'm working within displays information about the model, allowing edits.  </p>

<p>In the render of my view I capture the model based on a passed in 'id'. </p>

<pre><code>render: function() {

     this.model = myCollection.get(this.options.passedInId);

<p>My problem is when it comes back through the render the second time the get from the collection returns a different instance of the model (I can see a different cId on it) which does not contain my changed ""someFlag"" property.  Therefore my edits don't show up when the view is re-rendered.  I know there might be a more effecient way of handling this but my question is why does this occur?  Shouldn't the model fetched from the collection include the edits I made on that model?  </p>

<p>Only other thing is the ""myCollection"" in this example may have been reset between the initial get and the next get after the edit, but the id is still present and it finds a model just one without any of the updates.</p>

When an item on the list is clicked, the list controller uses <code>list.$getRecord(item.$id)</code> to get the particular record. Puts it in a global service(just and empty object with set and get) and in my detail controller i assign that service(already set to the selected item) to a scope variable in the detail controller and display it. </p>

<p>The information in the detail view is editable. and when it is editted, a save button appears which when clicked saves the edit using this code</p>

<pre><code>item = editItem; //editItem contains the new changes made on the detail page 
list.$save(item).then(function(ref){
    //ref.key() === item.$id; // 
    console.log(""Your Edit has been saved');
  });
</code></pre>

<p>This works. The edits are reflected on the remote firebase data.</p>

<p>But the problem occurs when i navigate back to the list view and try to click another item. It gets an error which says <code>list.$getRecord()</code> is not a function. Now this error doesn't occur when you don't save an edit on the details view.</p>

<p>I printed out the list array before and after i save and i realised this</p>

<p><strong>List array before an item is saved (contains AngularFire methods)</strong>
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ig89v.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ig89v.jpg"" alt=""List array before an item is saved""></a></p>

<p>I have no idea why $firebaseArray is reacting this way. Is there something i am missing? is this a normal behaviour? 
PS: i am using ionic and angularFire.</p>

<p>I can post more code if neccesary</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
Here is an abstraction of the code</p>

<p>List.html</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ion-list&gt;
    &lt;ion-item href=""#/lead/info""  ng-click=""vm.selectItem(l.$id)"" ng-repeat=""l in vm.list"" &gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;{{l.firstName}} {{l.lastName}}&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;h4 class=""""&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{{l.topic}}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/ion-item&gt;
  &lt;/ion-list&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>list.js (controller function)</p>

<pre><code>function ListCtrl(selectedItem, $firebaseArray) {
    /* jshint validthis: true */
    var vm = this;

    vm.list= {};
    vm.selectItem = selectItem;
    loadList(); //Loads the List array

function loadList() {

  var fireList = new Firebase(""https://xxxxx.firebaseio.com/list"");
  var r = $firebaseArray(fireList);

  r.$loaded(function () {
    vm.list = r;
  });

  console.log(vm.list); //Outputs the first image(above). But after an item edit and i go back, outputs the second image(above)
}

    function selectItem(index) {
      var sItem = vm.list.$getRecord(index);

      selectedItem.setList(vm.list);
      selectedItem.setItem(sItem);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>selectedItem</code> service is simple. i use it to set a single object or array of objects</p>

<pre><code>function selectedItem() {
    var sItem = {};
    var List = {};

    return {
        getItem: function () {
            return sItem;
        },
        setItem: function (authObject) {
            sItem = authObject;
        },
        getList: function(){
          return List;
        },
        setList: function(al){
          List = al;
        }
    };
  };
</code></pre>

<p>The detail view controller is ass so:</p>

<p>item.js(controller function)</p>

<pre><code>function ItemCtrl(selectedItem, $scope, $firebaseObject) {
    /* jshint validthis: true */
    var vm = this;
    $scope.selectedItem = selectedItem.getItem();
    $scope.listArray = selectedItem.getList();
    //vm.item = $scope.selectedItem;

 function saveEdit() {

      var t = $scope.selectedItem;

      $scope.listArray.$save(t).then(function(ref){
        //console.log(ref);
      });     
    }
  };
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>After serious cross checking throughout my code i realised the issue is not from AngularFiire array. Even the workaround i did with the <code>r.$watch</code> and <code>r.$loaded</code> was unnecessary. the need for the work around was cause by another part of my code i didnt think was relevant.
I apologise for the mistake. I'd be deleting this question and a related one soon</p>

<p>Imagine the flow:</p>

<li>an anonymous user comes to our website from <em>somewhere</em> (this is displayed on the frontend under the 'visitor log -> first visit -> from' section)</li>

<p>How can I get the origin of the visitor - from where he came - programmatically? I don't actually know when the user first came to the website.

In Jenkins general configuration I added my build slave as a remote host and gave it hostname, port, username, and keyfile path, but it still says ""Can't connect to server"". I wonder why, because if I login to Jenkins machine I can easily connect to my remote host in the command line using the same keyfile.</p>

<p>We're using nhibernate and recently noticed that its paging mechanism looks like this:</p>

<p>The query brings the db server to its knees. I think what's happening is that the nested query is assigning a row number to every row satisfied by the where clause before selecting the subset (rows 10 - 20). Since the nested query will return a lot of rows, the mechanism is not very efficient. I've seen lots of tips and tricks for doing this efficiently on other SQL platforms but I'm struggling to find a DB2 solution. In fact <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/0307balani/0307balani.html"" rel=""nofollow"">an article on IBM's own site</a> recommends the approach that nhibernate has taken.</p>

<p>Imagine this snippet of code:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
  int x, y, r;
} Circle;

Circle createCircle(int x, int y, int r){
  Circle create = {x, y, r};
  return create;
}

int main(void){
  Circle coords = createCircle(3, 2, 1);
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I'm creating a variable <code>create</code> in the function createCircle before returning it to the main function. I was wondering whether some form of shorthand existed to omit this middle step, for example like this:</p>

<pre><code>Circle createCircle(int x, int y, int r){
  return Circle {x, y, r};
}
</code></pre>

<p>Naturally, the above doesn't work, but it should give you an idea of what I'm looking to achieve. Is this possible, or am I better off creating a variable first?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>A -- B -- C -- D (master)
     \
      W -- X -- Y -- Z (topic)
</code></pre>

<p>And I need to manipulate the commits on 'topic' with various fixups, squashes, amends, etc., I would typically checkout 'topic' and run <code>git rebase -i</code>. Lets say I do that and I squash Z into Y, so it goes away as a unique commit. The <code>git rebase -i</code> will default to rebasing onto the head of master, and so I will get:</p>

<pre><code>A -- B -- C -- D (master)
               \
                W -- X -- YZ
</code></pre>

<p>Now, often I actually don't want the new commits on master to become visible on my topic branch (e.g. might cause an expensive recompile). </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""rebasing docs"">recommended way to do this</a> is to issue <code>git rebase -i HEAD~4</code> while on 'topic'. Great, that gets me what I really want, with Y and Z squashed and topic still originating at 'B'.</p>

<pre><code>A -- B -- C -- D (master)
     \
      W -- X -- YZ (topic)
</code></pre>

<p>However, what I don't like about this is that I need to manually count the number of commits in topic. This might be large, and will certainly change, so I can't just re-run it from my shell history. Every time I want to do this I need to run 'git log', count commits, edit the command, etc., and I 'rebase -i' all the time.</p>

<p>How can I achieve the same effect without needing to manually count the commits on the topic branch to synthesize 'HEAD~N'? In other words, I want a non-context-dependent command that means to interactively rebase all commits on the current topic branch without migrating them to the head of master.</p>

<p>It is fine if this is of the form <code>git rebase -i $(git ...)</code> since I just plan to alias this command or recover it from my history as needed, however, if possible I would prefer that it not mention the name of the topic branch, since that again makes the command context sensitive and I would need to edit it when I change topic branches.</p>

<p>How can I specify that I only care about the table data from the outer table?  Using the js fiddle example above: I only want the <code>name</code> and the <code>count</code>.  I don't want anything within the nested table.</p>

<p>I did notice that <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22504651/graphical-representation-of-html-table-data-using-high-charts"">this stackoverflow question</a>  as well as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17181019/how-to-specify-a-range-of-data-when-using-highcharts-with-table"">this one</a> appear very similar, but I had trouble applying it to my question. It appears that I just need to add the ids of <code>startRow</code> / <code>endRow</code> , or <code>startColumn</code> / <code>endColumn</code> but all my attempts doing so didn't work.</p>

<p>Here are my two domains:</p>

<p>Release.groovy</p>

<pre><code>package releasemap_api

import grails.rest.*
import org.grails.databinding.BindingFormat

@Resource(formats=['json', 'xml'])
class Release {
    String branch
    int build
    String buildUrl
    Date created = new Date() 
    static belongsTo = Component

    static constraints = {
        branch blank: false
        build blank: false, min: 0
        buildUrl url: true , unique: true
    }

    static mapping = {
        created defaultValue: new Date() 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Component.groovy</p>

<pre><code>package releasemap_api
import grails.rest.*

@Resource(formats=['json', 'xml'])
class Component {
    String name 
    static hasMany = [releases: Release]

    static constraints = {      
        name unique: true , blank: false        
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the idea is that a component can have multiple releases. I use the following URL Map to access/manage a component and its releases.</p>

<pre><code>""/components""(resources:""component"") {
    ""/releases""(resources:""release"")        
}
</code></pre>

<p>Right now I can perform the usual http verbs (PUT,POST,DELETE,GET) directly against the component and release controllers, but I wish to manage releases through their parent components.</p>

<p>For example, I want to perform a POST against </p>

<pre><code>./components/1/releases
</code></pre>

<p>to create a new release and add it to the component with id 1.</p>

<p>So far I was able to work through the release's GET request so that it functions properly directly and through the component url. </p>

<p>As you can see currently it just renders text.  The item model takes in two parameters:  a file and output.  The output could be xml, json, plain text, etc.  Some type of data.  What I was hoping I could do is that I could render the output based on the output parameter.  But make it dynamic.  I was hoping I could do:</p>

<pre><code>def convert
  @items = Item.convert(params[:file], params[:output])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.json { render :json =&gt; @items }
    format.xml { render :xml =&gt; @items }
  end
end

<p>Something that would call the method and based on the data returned it would render the appropriate data.  Testing the above code returns an empty page.  The body tag is completely empty.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I need the system to be quite flexible so i want to store the mapping between the lists and sql and then create any of the SQL that is missing.</p>

<p>So i would first have to check if the SQL table i want exists and if not create it. Then check all the columns i expect and create an missing ones then populate the table with the list data.</p>

<p>Getting the list data is no problem to me and it isn;t a problem for me to store by configuration information.</p>

<p>My issue is i'm not sure what .NET features to use when talking to the database. I was looking into the entity framework and LINQ but these seem to need fixed tables which i don't have.</p>

<p>I am also looking at using the enterprise libraries (4.1) as i use these for event logging.</p>

<p>I have a PHP file with a XSLTProcessor named <code>$bob</code>.</p>

<p>I want to send to my xsl transformation some parameters.</p>

<p>So, I write this in my PHP file; for example :</p>

<pre><code>$bob-&gt;setParameter('', 'message', 'hi');
</code></pre>

<p>In my XSL file, to get the parameter, I write this for example :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:param name=""message"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And if i want to display this param in my XSL, I do this :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:value-of select=""$message"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here comes the problem.</p>

<p>I have to send to my XSL an undefined number of parameters, and I don't know how to do it. I tried several solutions but they were not relevant. I want to send for example 3 messages to my XSL, and I want my XSL to use them to produce a code like this :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;messages&gt;
    &lt;message&gt;Hi&lt;/message&gt;
    &lt;message&gt;it's bob&lt;/message&gt;
    &lt;message&gt;How are you ?&lt;/message&gt;

<p>Do you have a solution for me ?
It will be very nice.
Sorry if my english has mistakes.
Thanks you and have a good day.</p>

<p><strong>As asked, here is what I have and what I want to have</strong> :</p>

<p><strong>(the following is separated)</strong></p>

<p>Here is a simplified version of my original XML, named posts.xml :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;posts&gt;
    &lt;post id=""post1"" &gt;
        &lt;titre&gt;Hey&lt;/titre&gt;
        &lt;motscles&gt;
            &lt;motcle&gt;Batman&lt;/motcle&gt;
            &lt;motcle&gt;Cats&lt;/motcle&gt;
        &lt;/motscles&gt;
    &lt;/posts&gt;
&lt;/posts&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the XML i want to have in final :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;posts&gt;
    &lt;post id=""post1"" &gt;
        &lt;titre&gt;Hey&lt;/titre&gt;
        &lt;motscles&gt;
            &lt;motcle&gt;Batman&lt;/motcle&gt;
            &lt;motcle&gt;Cats&lt;/motcle&gt;
        &lt;/motscles&gt;
    &lt;/posts&gt;
    &lt;post id=""post2"" &gt;
        &lt;titre&gt;Toto&lt;/titre&gt;
        &lt;motscles&gt;
            &lt;motcle&gt;Superman&lt;/motcle&gt;
            &lt;motcle&gt;Dogs&lt;/motcle&gt;
            &lt;motcle&gt;Cake&lt;/motcle&gt;
        &lt;/motscles&gt;
    &lt;/posts&gt;
&lt;/posts&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I obtained the information of the post (titre, motscles) by an HTML form.
So my php file get the information, and send it to my XSL file :</p>

<pre><code>// initialize xml and xsl
$xml = new DOMDocument();
$xml-&gt;load('posts.xml');
$xsl = new DOMDocument();
$xsl-&gt;load('addpost.xsl');

// Initialize the XSLTProcessor
$addPost  = new XSLTProcessor();
$addPost-&gt;importStylesheet($xsl);

// Define parameters
$addPost-&gt;setParameter('', 'titre', $_POST['titre']);

// Get the modified xml
$xml = $addPost-&gt;transformToDoc($xml);

// Save the modified xml
$xml-&gt;save('posts.xml');
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a simplified version of my XSL :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=""1.0"" 
    xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform""&gt;

        indent=""yes"" 
        encoding=""UTF-8""
        /&gt;

    &lt;xsl:param name=""titre"" /&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name=""motscles"" /&gt;

    &lt;xsl:template match=""posts"" &gt;
        &lt;xsl:copy&gt;

            &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=""@*"" /&gt;

            &lt;motscles&gt;

<p>At the very bottom we receive the correct value for the cookie, but then there's a lot of odd behavior going on.

I want to have my program let the user type in a subject area(s) and have the page return the amount of times each subject is being taken. </p>

<p>I then have some javascript that basically takes in some user input from a text field, parse that, and puts it into an array. Then, it imports the csv file and compares the subject columns to what the user inputs, and calculates the amount of time each subject is taking. </p>

<p>My javascript looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var globalArray      = [];
var schoolList       = [];
var splitTextInput   = [];
var count            = 0;
var splitSubjectArea = []; 

function myFunction()
{
    var textInput = document.getElementById('numb').value;
    var needsTrimTextInput = textInput.split("","");            //creating an array to store user input 

    for( var q = 0; q &lt; needsTrimTextInput.length; q++)          //getting rid of whitespace in user input 
    {
        splitTextInput[q] = needsTrimTextInput[q].trim(); 
    }

    for(var j = 0; j&lt; splitTextInput.length; j++)
    {
        var sSubjectArea = {}; 
        sSubjectArea[ splitTextInput[j] ] = 0;         //assigning the value to 0 to store the count of each subject 
    }

    var fileName = document.getElementById(""UniversitySelect"").value;

    if( fileName.indexOf("".csv"") &gt; 0 )
    {
        d3.csv( ""./"" + document.getElementById(""UniversitySelect"").value, bob, counting);
    }

    function bob(d){
        return { Area: d.Area };
    }

    function counting(error, rows)
    { 
        globalArray = rows;
        for( var i = 0; i &lt; rows.length; i++ ) //for the row in the CSV file 
        {                        
            for( var k = 0; k &lt; splitTextInput.length; k++ ) // loop to go through the different inputed subject areas
            {            
                if( rows[i].Area.toLowerCase().indexOf( splitTextInput[k].toLowerCase() ) &gt; -1)
                { 
                    count++; //stores the overall count

        console.log(rows);
        for(r = 0; r &lt; splitTextInput.length; r++)
        {
            console.log( sSubjectArea[ splitTextInput[r] ] );
        }//for
    }//function
}//function
</code></pre>

<p>I know it partially works, because if I enter in 2 subjects, say Chemistry and Biology, which are taken 3 times each, then the count will be 6. However, I cannot get sSubjectArea to hold the count for each individual subject. What am I doing wrong? When I added the <code>console.log(sSubjectArea[splitTextInput[k]])</code> line, the output I get is:</p>

<pre><code>    1

    2 
    3

<p>And I don't really understand why I get those numbers &amp; especially NaN.... can anyone help? I'm really new to javascript, so I might have made some sort of fundamental error in understanding objects, but I can't figure it out. Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!! </p>

I have Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, so I got asked to ""convert to the current Visual C++ project format"" which I did, and that gave me an error saying ""Cannot load the project due to a corrupt project file"", so I downloaded wsdl-1.23 and that worked.</p>

<p>My current issue right now is compiling the solution which does not completely succeed.
(I have right clicked the solution and clicked on clean, then rebuild)
Below is the log for building the solution.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

It uses A* pathfinding tens of thousands of times per second to solve a tiles matching game. The application is finished, and it runs pretty fast (I've been testing in netbeans the whole time). I've clocked it at 700 attempts per second (each attempt is probably 20 or so pathfinds). When I build the project it creates a jar, and I can run this outside of netbeans. If I use the command line (Windows 7), and use java -jar theFile.jar, I clock it at 1000 attempts per second. This is understandable since the IDE was probably using a bit of cpu power and holding it back (My application is multicored, you can set the number. I usually use 3/4 so it doesnt slow my system too much). Now, the confusing part. Obviously I don't want the user to have to use the command line every time they want to run this application on windows. They should just be able to click the jar. The problem is that when I double click the jar file, the program runs at a sickly 300 attempts per second!!</p>

<p>Why on earth would these three ways of running the exact same program, all else being constant, have such a massive impact on performance? Is my fix to create a script to run the .jar by command line, or do you guys recognize what's going on here? Thanks very much!</p>

<p>Edit: New Information</p>

<p>I made a batch file with the command: java -jar theFile.jar
When this is executed, it runs at the same speed as it would if I ran it in the console (so, 1000 att/sec)</p>

<p>However, I also made an executable with a simple c++ program. The program had just a couple lines, and was System(""java -jar theFile.jar""); and return 0;. Unbeleivably, this runs at the speed of double clicking the jar file, about 300att/sec. How bizarre! It could very well be different IDE parameters, but i'm not sure how to check the default system parameters, or how to modify them for this particular jar. </p>

<p>For some reason, even though I give the select field the proper class name (affector), when I select different options in the field, the other parts of the form do not disable.  The static text field with the same class works fine.  I'm stumped.</p>

<p>The main annoyance I have is that in the trait, my IDE has no idea of the type of $this->tags, and throws up a bunch of warnings. I'm being pretty OCD about getting my code documented here, so that it's really easy for other developers to pick up.</p>

<pre><code>trait TaggableMethods {
    /** @var \Doctrine\Common\Collections\Collection */
    protected $tags; // &lt;-- Can't seem to define here…
    public function addTag(Tag $tag) {
        $this-&gt;tags-&gt;add($tag);
    }
    public function removeTag(Tag $tag) {
        $this-&gt;tags-&gt;removeElement($tag);
    }
    public function getTags() {
        return $this-&gt;tags;
    }
}

class TaggableThingA {
    use TaggableMethods;
    /**
     * @var \Doctrine\Common\Collections\Collection
     * @ORM\ManyToMany(targetEntity=""Tag"")
     * @ORM\JoinTable(name=""ThingA__Tag"")
     */
    protected $tags; // &lt;--… because PHP complains about this
}

class TaggableThingB {
    use TaggableMethods;
    /**
     * @var \Doctrine\Common\Collections\Collection
     * @ORM\ManyToMany(targetEntity=""Tag"")
     * @ORM\JoinTable(name=""ThingB__Tag"")
     */
    protected $tags;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My problem, so far as I can tell, is that I can't define the $tags property in the trait, as I need to override the annotations.</p>

<p>I can avoid defining $tags at all in TaggableMethods, but to me, this breaks encapsulation, or at least makes the code a little harder to read.</p>

<p>I can configure persistence using Yaml or XML, but all the rest of my entities use annotations.</p>

<p>So I'm looking for a way to avoid the runtime notice that gets generated, which Symfony turns into a ContextErrorException, killing my script during development.</p>

<p>This is probably related to ""<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28564387/can-we-use-traits-to-map-manytoone-relationship-with-doctrine2"">can we use traits to map manyToOne relationship with doctrine2?</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24158392/traits-property-conflict-with-parent-class"">Traits - property conflict with parent class</a>""</p>

<p>Also, the behaviour for inherited methods mentioned in  ""<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11521403/php-5-4-why-can-classes-override-trait-methods-with-a-different-signature"">PHP 5.4: why can classes override trait methods with a different signature?</a>"" sounds very close to what I want for properties - can anyone explain why the difference between properties and methods exists?</p>

To give you an idea, think of just logging some user events. The library must keep doing this stuff until the user exits the app or sends it to the background (pushes the home button) - in other words it needs to keep doing stuff inside a loop. </p>

<p>The only interaction between the main app thread and the spawned thread is that occasionally the main app thread will put some stuff (an event object) into a queue that the spawned thread can read/consume. Other than that, the spawned thread just keeps going until the app exists or backgrounds.</p>

<p>Part of what the spawned thread needs to do (though not all of it) involves sending data to an HTTP server. I would have thought that it would be easy to subclass NSThread, override its main method, and just make a synchronous call to NSUrlConnection with some sort of timeout on that connection so the thread doesn't hang forever. For example, in Java/Android, we just subclass Thread, override the start() method and call a synchronous HTTP GET method (say from Apache's HttpClient class). This is very easy and works fine. But from what I have seen here and elsewhere, apparently on iOS it is much more complicated than this and I'm more than a bit confused as to what the best approach is that actually works.</p>

<p>So should I subclass NSThread and somehow use NSUrlConnection? It seems the asynchronous NSUrlConnection does not work inside NSThread because delegate methods don't get called but what about the synchronous method? Do I somehow need to use and configure the RunLoop and set up an autorelease pool? Or should I use an NSOperation? It seems to me that what I am trying to do is pretty common - does anyone have a working example of how to do this properly?</p>

   3    |       90       |   true
   3    |       67       |   true
</code></pre>

<p>In the application, the users basically evaluate if the affirmations are correct or wrong, marking them as true or false. Each affirmation is evaluated only once, so users are evaluating different affirmations.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is select a resultset like the one bellow, where I can count the number of affirmations each user marked as correct and the number they marked as false.</p>

<pre><code> user | correct_count | wrong_count
------------------------------------
  1   |      35       |    12
  2   |      76       |    22
  3   |      23       |    41
</code></pre>

<p>I have a query to count the number of correct answers of each user, and I can simply change the expected value of ísCorrect' field to false, so I'll count the number of wrong answers each user gave. My problem is how to gather the corrcet count and the wrong count, since I can't simply use UNION.</p>

One of the pieces is a button that launches a modal that would allow a user to edit the item. I am curious what the better approach is when it comes to loading the data:</p>

<p>1) add data attributes to each button during the initial load containing the data of the item and load those into the inputs when the 'edit' button is pressed</p>

<p>or </p>

<p>2) execute an AJAX call when the modal is launched, fetch the item from the database, and then load it into the inputs.</p>

I have below question about 'Sorting a singly linked list' (Any kind of list for that matter) Assume for this questions we want to sort in ascending order of values in each node.</p>

<p>Does this question expect me to just sort the list by swapping the values of each node in the list so that the values are in some order(ascending/descending). Here the original values of nodes (before sorting) would be changed in order to reflect the sorted list. Here the same earlier head pointer is returned but now having the smallest element in it, which might be different than its earlier element.</p>

<p>Like this C code I have below(The code below might not compile as is , but I have it working fine. Posted here as illustrative to clear my point):</p>

<pre><code>struct lnk_lst 
{
   int val;
   struct lnk_lst *next;
};

main()
{

  //Assume curr is the head node of the singly linked list created with some values
curr = llist_bubble_sort(curr);

}

struct lnk_lst* llist_bubble_sort(struct lnk_lst *lst)
{
    int i,n=0,tmpint;
    struct lnk_lst *tmp=lst,*tmp2=lst;

    while(tmp-&gt;next)
    {
        lst = tmp2;
        while(lst-&gt;next)
        {
            if(lst-&gt;val &gt; lst-&gt;next-&gt;val)

                lst-&gt;next-&gt;val = tmpint;
            }
            lst = lst-&gt;next;
        }
        tmp = tmp-&gt;next;
    }

    return tmp2;

}
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<p>Is it expected to that the pointer to the node with the smallest element(assuming ascending order) in the original ordering is moved as new head node, then the node having the next smallest element is linked to the head node, and so on such that the list is reordered completely and now the head node returned is not same pointer as earlier.</p>

<p>If the interpretation of list sort is this second, then I have to see how yet get the idea done in code.</p>

<p>When I view the site on my development box (F5), everything works great. I have no complaints.</p>

<p>The problem is when I publish the site and try to view it (any browser). The aspx page loads in the iFrame alright -- but when I click the second tab, all of my controls are missing. When I click the 3rd tab, those controls are there but the tabs themselves disappear! So my user is left stuck and cannot do his/her job.</p>

<p>Any ideas what might be going on?</p>

<p>Given two ordered arrays that contain N elements each, optimize the number of wins by reordering the first array.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>a[0] = rock     
a[1] = paper
a[2] = paper
a[3] = rock

b[0] = paper
b[1] = rock
b[2] = scissors
b[3] = rock

// currently
a[0] vs b[0] = -1 // (rock losses to paper)
a[1] vs b[1] = +1 // (paper beats rock)
a[2] vs b[2] = -1 // (paper losses to scissors)
a[3] vs b[3] = 0 // (rock ties to rock)
</code></pre>

<p>An optimal order that should be returned is { 1, 0, 3, 2 }</p>

<pre><code>paper ties paper
rock ties rock
rock beats scissors
paper beats rock
</code></pre>

<p>The question is, how do I arrive to this result? A few constraints. </p>

<p>Ties are more preferable than having a win and loss offsetting each other. This is probably achieved by weighing a loss more than a win. i.e.</p>

<pre><code>a[0] = rock
a[1] = paper
b[0] = paper
b[1] = rock

{0, 1} vs b[..] = -1, +.95 = -.05
{1, 0} vs b[..] = 0, 0 = 0 // preferred order
</code></pre>

<p>Also, a win at the bottom of the array is preferred.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to accomplish this? Thanks.</p>

Actually it's not really boot proccess, because the module is called by udev which is user-space program, but it still very stressed time and tending to deadlocks and other bad stuff.</p>

<p>The problem is that I can't have the logs from the module while loading, because the syslogd is still dead while the module get stuck. What I get in the syslog or messages is just few first lines of the boot process.</p>

<p>I have two ideas how to debaug, but I don't know how to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Netconsole. Should be very simple, but I don't know how to force it load with wanted configuration before my module.</li>
<li>USB debug cable. I configured the kernels as described <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/x86/earlyprintk.txt"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""here"">here</a>, but couldn't figure aut what exactly the device number to append after <code>earlyprintk=dbgp</code> and which port is the one I need.</li>

<p>1) Can you create a SQLite db file and have a PhoneGap app use that. And if so, how would you develop with that in the browser prior to building in PhoneGap? (so you can test)</p>

<p>I'm currently using a Wordpress theme that I bought from a designer, who since then has disappeared and doesn't reply any message regarding the theme.</p>

<p>On this theme, I've been using for more than a year the simple and elegant ""PrettyPhoto"" lightbox plugin (<a href=""http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/</a>). </p>

<p>Everything used to work just fine, but today I suddenly discovered that the ""lightbox"" effect is now cancelled: every photo now opens underneath the main page, instead of popping up in a floating window -- and it looks really, really ugly (see example here).</p>

<p>From what I understand it's probably a kind of javascript conflict happening within my theme, but I can't put my finger on it. I had a jQuery 1.8.2 file in my JS directory, but replacing it with version 1.9.1 brought no joy.</p>

<p>Firebug gives me the following JS error:</p>

<p>The strangest thing is that PrettyPhoto does work on my local server -- the main difference between the local and online versions of my site being that the latter is a newer version of Wordpress...</p>

<p>There is some deep JS conflict inside my theme, but I can't find its source. If anyone has a clue, all help would be strongly appreciated!</p>

<p>I then look at Windows Defender History log, and see that it was ""permitted"", but do not see it under either allowed programs or quarantined programs.</p>

"29812109","1","30070738","","2015-04-23 01:42:55","","0","145","<p>I've got a basic setup using Robospice with Retrofit in a shell Android application making REST calls, parsing JSON response into a POJO and that I can then use to render in an Activity. I now want to use TLS only for transport security (not SSL). I've read that Retrofit with OkHttp can be used to achieve this but I don't know where to make the update in my code.</p>

<p>I have a basic interface:</p>

<pre><code>public interface RandomAPI {
    @GET(""/users"")
    List&lt;User&gt; getUsers(@Path(""owner"") String owner, @Path(""repo"") String repo);

    @GET(""/users/{userid}"")
    User getUser(@Path(""userid"") int userID);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a Service:</p>

<pre><code>public class RandomService extends RetrofitGsonSpiceService {

private final static String BASE_URL = ""http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"";

@Override
public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    addRetrofitInterface(RandomAPI.class);
}

@Override
protected String getServerUrl() {
    return BASE_URL;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>and finally a request:</p>

<pre><code>public class RandomRequest extends RetrofitSpiceRequest&lt;User, RandomAPI&gt; {

private int userID;

public RandomRequest(int userID) {
    super(User.class, RandomAPI.class);
    this.userID = userID;
}

@Override
public User loadDataFromNetwork() throws Exception {
    return getService().getUser(userID);
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm guessing I need to update the Service but not really sure how. I really like the simplicity of this pattern so would like to keep it if possible. I can drop the OkHttp jars into the application but I don't know how to get at the actual implementation of the service, or how to add my custom one so that all requests use it.</p>

<p>Has any one had experience with this that could share some code snippets or point me to an example?</p>

<p><strong>~~ EDIT ~~</strong></p>

<p>Looking into the API for Robospice, looks like my request can just extend SpiceRequest, then within the loadFromNetwork() method I just do plain Retrofit and OkHTTP stuff. Is that the only way though? Thought there would be a way to set your own <code>RestAdapter</code> implementation in <a href=""https://github.com/stephanenicolas/robospice/blob/release/extensions/robospice-retrofit-parent/robospice-retrofit/src/main/java/com/octo/android/robospice/retrofit/RetrofitSpiceService.java"" rel=""nofollow""><code>RetrofitSpiceService</code></a> instead of just using the default.</p>

<p>Problem 2 - this only catches formal names of countries. Does anyone know a good list of common country names? (for example 'China' vs 'The People Democratic Republic of China')</p>

<p>Thanks! </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Here is a list of 90 coffee names to make this a reproducible example;
I want to add that in my actual application, CoffeeTable already exists and has ~2,000 rows and 45 columns. I'm not looking for faster ways to construct the data.frame / etc. </p>

{ List&lt;Quote&gt; list = new List&lt;Quote&gt;(); }

<p>Then, I bind quotes in XAML to a grid.</p>

<p>It does not work meaning that changes to the list is not updated. I suppose that I may try to replace <code>List</code> with <code>ObservableCollection</code> in the first project but I would prefer not to do it, if possible.</p>

<p>What would be the best practise. In all examples I saw, the list (<code>ObservableCollection</code>) is created on <code>ViewModel</code> level. In my case, the list is created and updated on lower level. 
How to make quotes (ObservableCollection) aware of changes to quotelist (List)? I hope my description makes sense.</p>

<p>I am creating an Android App, which sends a broadcast message to the network and prepares a list of devices responding back.</p>

<p>Now What I did:</p>

<p>I created an <code>Activity</code> Class <code>DeviceManagerWindow.java</code> which calls a thread <code>Sender.java</code>.
<code>Sender.java</code> is responsible for sending the broadcast message.</p>

<p>Then the <code>DeviceManagerWindow.java</code> calls another thread which is responsible for listening to the devices responding back. The <code>devices</code> responding back will be listed in the Activity as soon as the device responds back. For that I have a <code>TableLayout</code> named <code>deviceList</code>.</p>

<p>What code I have written:</p>

<p><strong>DeviceManagerWindow.java</strong> <code>This method is called when a button for search is pressed</code></p>

<p>To illustrate with a simplified example, the resources represented by the API form a tree structure:</p>

<pre><code>           root
            /\
           /  \
          /    \
      group   group    
        /       /\
       /       /  \
      /       /    \
project  project  project
</code></pre>

<p>To create a new instance of a child, knowledge of its parent is required. For example, to create a new group it must have knowledge of the root so that it can retrieve the URI for creating a group from the root.</p>

<p>I'm reasonably happy with read access:</p>

<pre><code>api = Api.new(...)
api.groups # An array of all groups
api.groups.select(...).projects # An array of all a group's projects
</code></pre>

<p>It's creating new resources that I'm unsure about.</p>

<p>I've considered having a create method on an array subclass:</p>

<pre><code>group = api.groups.create(""group-name"")
project = group.projects.create(""project-name"")
</code></pre>

<p>Instantiating the type directly, taking the parent as a constructor argument:</p>

<pre><code>group = Group.new(api, ""project-name"")
project = Project.new(group, ""project-name"")
</code></pre>

<p>Create methods on the parent:</p>

<pre><code>group = api.create_group(""group-name"")
project = group.create_project(""project-name"")
</code></pre>

<p>Of the three approaches above, I prefer the first as it's concise and allows creation to be chained. The third option is similar, but it doesn't feel right - in terms of the REST API, the create is happening at the wrong level as it's the groups resource the allows creation of a group. That said, I'm not an experienced Ruby developer and, first and foremost, I want the Ruby API to be idiomatic for Ruby developers even if that means it doesn't exactly match the model of the REST API.</p>

<p>It prints a lot of the closing ?> tags, but if I remove the tag as well as its opening counterpart, it prints all the code that was between. I've been stuck on this for the last few days and really need some help. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong> 
I figured it out. I was executing from the directory instead of the address. (not sure if I worded that right). So instead browser pointing to registration page from ""<a href=""http://localhost:port/register.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:port/register.php</a>"" it was pointing to ""file:///C:/xampp/htdocs/register.php""</p>

<p>I'm having problems because I'm not doing this by AJAX.</p>

<p>So, the index.php has the following:</p>

<pre><code>/* Before HTML tag */
if(Cookie::Exists('comment')){
    $data = unserialize(stripslashes(Cookie::Get('comment')));
    if($data['status'] == 1){
        $page = ""&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;set_product_id('"" . $data['id'] . ""')&lt;/script&gt;"";
    }
    Cookie::Delete('comment', time() - 3600);
}

/* Further ahead.. (inside body) */
&lt;form method=""POST"" action=""insert_info.php"" data-ajax=""false""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""hidden"" id=""product_id"" name=""product_id""/&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" id=""name_"" name=""name_"" required=""required""/&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" id=""comment"" name=""comment"" required=""required""/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

/* After body */
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

$(document).on(""pagebeforeshow"", ""#page-comments"", function() {
    $(function(){
        get_comments(objs.product_id);
    });
});

var objs = {
    product_id : ''
}

function set_product_id(id){
    objs.product_id = id;
    $.mobile.changePage('#page-comments', {role: 'dialog'}); 
}
&lt;/script&gt;

/* After the HTML tag */
&lt;?php echo $page; ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I do receive the correct ID, etc, also it works perfectly before submiting the comment. The page loads the content without any problem, etc.</p>

<p>insert_info.php</p>

<pre><code>new_comment($host, $user, $pass, $db);

$arr = array(""status"" =&gt; 1, ""id"" =&gt; $_POST['product_id']);
Cookie::set('comment', serialize($arr), time()+60);

header(""Location: ../index.php"");
exit();
</code></pre>

<p>When I perform this operation, I do receive the following erro on google chrome console:</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'trigger' of undefined
</code></pre>

<p>Poiting to the line:</p>

<pre><code>function set_product_id(id){
    objs.product_id = id;
    $.mobile.changePage('#page-comments', {role: 'dialog'}); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>What am I missing? Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> changing the set_product_id() function, to this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#page-main').on('pagecreate', function(event) {
    $.mobile.changePage('#page-comments', {role: 'dialog'}); 
});
</code></pre>

<p>The page of comments appears and disappears again. But if I remove the ""dialog"", the page stays and works correctly. But I need that to be on dialog.</p>

<p>1) The character 'ç' has an ASCII code 135. That's a fact. However, when I run</p>

<pre>
begin
  ascii('ç');
end;
</pre>

<p>I get <code>50087</code>.</p>

<p>2) When I run</p>

<pre>
begin
  dbms_output.put_line(chr(135));
end;
</pre>

<p>I get <code>pure nothing</code>.</p>

<p>Well apparently, ascii() and chr() handle only values in 0..127. So my question is how to I find the unicode equivalents OR write my own extensions that work with values like 'ç' and 135.</p>

<p>Help will be much appreciated.</p>

<p>P.S. I am using Oracle SQL Developer.</p>

It seems to be calling its self recursively.</p>

<p>my domains are set up like:</p>

<p>Product domain:</p>

<pre><code> class Product {
     String name
     String comments
     static hasMany = [components:Components]
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Component domain:</p>

<pre><code> class Components {
     Product product
     static hasMany = [alternatives:Product]
     static belongsTo = Product
 }
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to be causing a infinate loop and not saving the components correctly.
I know when using JSON.use(""deep"") on a Product I get a ../.. in components. The next strange thing is that. If I as for a product as JSON after I saved that product everything works fine, but when I try and get the same product as JSON later I get the ../.. in components.</p>

<p>I am totally lost about this.</p>

<p>If you require more details please let me know and I will me best to comply.</p>

<li>Write a script that will extract all of the values from the database and generate a file that will then be scanned by the aforementioned bash script and add the values to the <code>pot</code> file, and another script that will run just after the bash script to re-update all of the values in the DB.</li>
</ol>

<p>Neither of these solutions really seem to be ideal. The first one would be easy to set up and easy to use with Pootle, but I lose all flexibility that comes with using a DBMS and I would have to import the entire array every time I want to use it. Loss of functionality isn't really that bad, because I (currently) am not performing any advanced calculations on the rows, basically just <code>SELECT</code>s and that's it. The second one, could work, but would take significantly more planning (and coding) to set up correctly.</p>

<p>Are there any other ways that I'm missing that would give me the flexibility of a database, but allow me to easily translate it in a centralized place along with the rest of the site, like Pootle?</p>

What I want to do is create a scrolling stack of views where the content is not known until runtime. I want to let a user custom build their screen by specifying an image, heading text, body text etc. However, I want all objects to use the full width of whatever device they are using and just append onto the bottom. I've tried using both a uitableview as well as the TZStackView on github. However, I'm having problems with the images. I want them to scale to the width of the screen, while maintaining the image's aspect ratio. I'm using AspectFit, but not getting the results I would expect. It simply downsizes the image, and it doesn't take up the full width. I've also had no luck creating it in storyboard with autolayout.</p>

<p>I tried calculating the size with sizeThatFits as follows, but the image won't go to full width:</p>

<pre><code>let size: CGSize = imageView.sizeThatFits(CGSizeMake(self.view.bounds.width, CGFloat.max))
</code></pre>

<p>What is the best approach to create something like this (e.g. tableview, stack of views, etc.) and how can I get the image and underlying view to size to the full screen width, and whatever height is necessary to get that width while maintaining the aspect ratio of the image? I also need to be able to place any subsequent images or text so that they display immediately below. I prefer a Swift solution, if possible, as I'm not good with objective-c. Thanks.</p>

<li>Default bundling seems to bundle them in alphabetical order.</li>
<li>To get them to bundle properly, I have to rename them to: ""0.insects.js"", ""1.bugs.js"", ""2.ants.js""</li>
<li>That's really hackish and there has to be a cleaner way.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next problem I'm having is debugging. I like to step through the javascript in my testing browsers, is there a way to turn off just the minification while in DEBUG mode?</p>

i have and Angularjs application that makes an api call to a c# back-end.</p>

<p>the factory part of my application looks like this</p>

<pre><code> return $http({
                url: url,
                method: ""POST"",
                headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },

                    couponCode: customer.couponcode,
                    firstName: customer.firstName,
                    lastName: customer.lastName,
                    userName: customer.choiceName,
                    emailAddress: customer.emailAddress,
                    phoneNumber: customer.choicePhoneNumber,
                    customerAddress: customer.choiceAddress,
                    food: customer.Food,
                    merchantName: customer.merchantName,
                    merchantEmailAddress: customer.merchantEmailAddress,
                    merchantOfficeAddress: customer.merchantOfficeAddress,

                }
            });
</code></pre>

<p>and the controller method looks like this</p>

<pre><code>       [System.Web.Http.HttpPost]
    public bool Post(BookingDto customer)
    {

       bool status = false;

       return status;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>now the web.config file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;handlers accessPolicy=""Read, Script""&gt;
  &lt;remove name=""WebDAV"" /&gt;
  &lt;remove name=""ExtensionlessUrlHandler-ISAPI-4.0_64bit"" /&gt;

&lt;/handlers&gt;
&lt;modules&gt;
  &lt;remove name=""WebDAVModule""/&gt;
&lt;/modules&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and this works for the POST API call on both fiddler and the Angularjs application, but when i execute a PUT, they both fail.
i researched on this and then added </p>

<pre><code>&lt;modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests=""true"" /&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>and then both PUT and POST works on fiddler but neither works on the Angularjs part.
and finally when i change the Content-Type of the Angularjs to</p>

<pre><code>headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
</code></pre>

<p>i get a 200 ok response for POST from the Angularjs but it doesen't hit the debugger break point but if i remove the data part of the Angularjs request i.e</p>

<pre><code> data: {

        post = super(EventForm, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
        post.save()

<p>Since in my debug I can see I think too many <code>__init__'s</code></p>

<p>For this I receive the error <code>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: input == null!</code></p>

<p>I don't understand why the above code doesn't work. From everything I read, I don't see why it wouldn't. I've been told I should be using <code>FileInputStream</code> instead of <code>GetResourceAsStream</code>, but, as I just said, I don't see why. I've read documentation on the methods and various guides and this seems like it would work.</p>

<p>Edit: Okay, trying to clear some things up with regards to what I have in the classpath.</p>

<p>This is a project created in Eclipse. Everything is in the project folder <code>DreamGame</code>, including the ""Images"" folder. <code>DreamGame</code> is, of course, in the classpath. I know this works because I'm reading a text file in <code>/Images</code> with info on the gif earlier on in the code.</p>

<p>So I have: <code>/DreamGame/Images/player.gif</code></p>

<p>Edit 2: The line that's currently in the original post is all that's being passed; no <code>/DreamGame/Images/player.gif</code>, just <code>/Images/player.gif</code>. This is from a method in the class <code>ImagesLoader</code> which is called when an object from <code>PlayerSprite</code> is created. The main class is <code>DreamGame</code>. I'm running the code right from Eclipse using the <code>Run</code> option with no special parameters</p>

<p>Trying to figure out how to find which class loader is loading the class. Sorry, compared to most people I'm pretty new at this.</p>

<p>Okay, this is what <code>getClassLoader()</code> gets me: <code>sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@4ba778</code></p>

<p><code>getClass().getResource(getClass().getName() + "".class"")</code> returns <code>/home/gixugif/Documents/projects/DreamGame/bin/ImagesLoader.class</code></p>

<p>The image file is being put in <code>bin</code> as well. To double check I deleted the file from <code>bin</code>, cleaned the project, and ran it. Still having the same problem, and the image file is back in <code>bin</code></p>

<p>We have a collection for sessions and when a new session gets created or modified, we want to upsert it in one operation - rather than having to query if a document exists yet and then either inserting or replacing.</p>

<p>Our old upsertion code used the scala driver casbah 2.7.3.  It looked like:</p>

<pre><code>import com.mongodb.casbah.MongoCollection
import com.mongdb.DBObject
val sessionCollection: MongoCollection = ...
val sessionKey: String = ...
val sessionDocument: DBObject = ... // Either create a new one, or find and modify an existing one

sessionCollection.update(
    ""_id"" -&gt; sessionKey,
    sessionDocument
    upsert = true
)
</code></pre>

<p>In our current project we're just using the plain java 3.0.1 driver and we're using <code>BsonDocument</code> instead of <code>DBObject</code> to make it more typsafe. I tried to replace the above with something like:</p>

<pre><code>import com.mongodb.client.MongoCollection
val sessionCollection: MongoCollection = ...
val sessionKey: String = ...
val sessionDocument: BsonDocument = // Either create a new one, or find and modify an existing one

val updateOptions = new UpdateOptions
updateOptions.upsert(true)

sessionCollection.updateOne(
    ""_id"" -&gt; new BsonString(sessionKey),
    sessionDocument,
    updateOptions
)
</code></pre>

<p>This throws the error ""java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid BSON field name ..."". The error is covered in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29434207/mongodb-update-using-java-3-driver"">this question</a> but the op in that question wasn't trying to upsert in one operation - they were using context to decide whether to replace/update/insert etc...</p>

<p>I'm happy with code samples in scala or java.</p>

<p>I'm writing a regex pattern that looks into the user's writing and paint with another color the matches that is founded.
I want for example to paint with another color, if the user write something like this:</p>

<pre><code>foo()
</code></pre>

<p>the thing is that I DON'T want to paint that if the user writes something else after that, I mean if the user write only</p>

<pre><code>""foo()"" (or ""foo() "")
</code></pre>

<p>then it's fine, I want to paint it, but if the user write</p>

<pre><code>""foo()d"" 
</code></pre>

<p>I don't want to paint that because is now well written for me. </p>

<p>I already wrote the regex pattern that match the ""foo()"" (or also with a dot in the middle, like ""foo.foo()""), but I´m facing with that problem. 
I need to add something to my pattern that allow only a space, or nothing (if the user write something else after the "")"" I don't want to match it.)
This is my pattern:</p>

<pre><code>[a-z]*\.?[a-z]*\((""[^""\r\n]*""|[-]?\b\d+[\.]?\d*\b)?\)

Recently I was asked to update the code so that it could do the same if the SharePoint 2010 Web site used claims-based authentication.</p>

<p>I hoped that this would be reasonably easy, but Googling for code samples, instead have found myself staring at code samples much more complicated than expected.</p>

<p>I was expecting to write something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (!claimsBased)
{

    clientContext.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(username, password, domain);

    clientContext.ExecutingWebRequest += clientContext_ExecutingWebRequest;
    Web webSite = clientContext.Web;
    WebCollection childWebSites = clientContext.Web.Webs;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where clientContext_ExecutingWebRequest is a method that uses the same authentication credentials and some URL to access an STS, but to be honest this was where I got lost in code samples.</p>

<p>Can anyone provide or point me to a simple example? Thanks for any help, Martin</p>

<p>We have a web interface (built using CI) that reports on data in a mysql database built by a third party.  This database is massive. 
For one particular report, we are getting the following error: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 536870912 bytes exhausted (tried
  to allocate 32 bytes) in
  /var/www/localhost/htdocs/myapp/system/database/drivers/mysql/mysql_result.php

<p>We've already increased the memory limit once in php.ini.  Before I do that again, I found this article: </p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1425138/increasing-php-memory-limit-at-what-point-does-it-become-insane"">Increasing PHP memory_limit. At what point does it become insane?</a></p>

<p>I like the approach the user is suggesting the selected answer.  But I'm not exactly sure how to make practical application in my case. </p>

<p>The interface I've built is called like so: </p>

<pre><code>http://internal_server/myreportingapplication/index.php/reporter/report_all_widgets
</code></pre>

<p>Another web app makes the curl call and consumes the json results for display. 
Although we have a lot of RAM on our server, I would like to try the 'php -d' option but I'm not sure how I would go about that in my case. </p>

<p>If someone could point me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong></p>

<p>In case this helps clarify the question... </p>

<p>In the link I refer to in my original question, the answer suggests doing the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead, I would launch that job from command-line (or via a cron
  job), and specify a higher memory_limit specificaly in this one and
  only case.</p>
  
  <p>This can be done with the -d option of php, like :</p>
  
  <p>$ php -d memory_limit=1GB temp.php string(3) ""1GB""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my case, would that mean running something like this: </p>

<pre><code>$ php -d memory_limit=1GB &lt;path to my CI model or controller php file&gt;

<pre>Table 21
id | property1 | data..
1 | goodbye | data about goodbye..
2 | ciao | data about ciao..</pre>

<p>So first i want to select in binder the binder i need to get the tablesname where data is stored. So i need to select table by a fieldname in this case the fieldname is tableid1 and would have the content 21 so that i have to look in 21. AND it should be property 1 from table 456 and table 21 the same... i am using php and already tried with union and subquerys but it seems that i am to silly to prepare such query! </p>

<p>I am writing a MapReduce program in Python that reads JSON objects from an Amazon S3 location and export it to a local CSV file. The CSV file will then export data to a MySQL and HBase database. I have about 200 million records (1 TB), so I need to optimize every processing step.</p>

<p>What data type should I use to store the TimeStamp value in Python, CSV, MySQL and HBase database? I need to store all aspects of the TimeStamp value. My schema has 4 columns in the CSV file, MySQL and HBase database tables.</p>

It is said that if multiple threads access e.g. a field at the same time, there can only be some bad consequences. So, what is the point of keeping <strong>non</strong> thread-safe code? I'm focusing mostly on .NET, but I believe the main reasons are not language-dependent.</p>

<p>E.g. .NET static fields are not thread-safe. What would be the result <em>if they were</em> thread-safe by default? (without a need to perform ""manual"" locking). What are the benefits of using (actually defaulting to) non-thread-safety? </p>

<p>One thing that comes to my mind is performance (more of a guess, though). It's rather intuitive that, when a function or field doesn't need to be thread-safe, it shouldn't be. However, the question is: what for? Is thread-safety just an additional amount of code you always need to implement? In what scenarios can I be 100% sure that e.g. a field won't be used by two threads at once?</p>

In the custom tab bar, I have two buttons linked with custom segue to two view controllers. What this custom segue does is to replace the subview inside my custom tab bar controller with the two view controllers.</p>

<p>After I've done this, my custom tab bar controller works fine when switching between the two buttons. However, when I try to place a button onto one of the view controllers and add a modal segue from the button to a brand new view controller, problem happens. When I pressed the button, the program crashes. </p>

<p>I'm thinking the problem might be the view controller hierarchy problem. On the other hand, I created a new project with same storyboard structure and custom segue, this time, when I place a button in one of the view controller and connects using a modal segue to a new view controller, it works, but with a warning saying ""Presenting view controllers on detached view controllers is discouraged"".</p>

<p>The delay is not a problem in terms of usability, for now.  And it'll be awhile before I have to worry about scalability, if ever.  But I am trying to adhere to best practices, as much as is reasonable.  What are your thoughts?  Is 4 requests a reasonable number? </p>

<p>I am making a program that lets people created countries. The thick red lines in the picture below are the borders to said countries. I am trying to figure out how to generate a polygon that will fill the entire area inside of the ""border"" lines. I have the triangulation code that accepts the polygons working - I tested that out with a polygon I entered manually - now I'm trying to figure out how to generate the polygon from the lines/linked point.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/9YYeu.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>For more info - all the red lines are how the yellow dots are linked together. The users drag the yellow dots together to link the lines. It is possible for the polygon to have a hole inside and be open - what I am trying to do is make code that handles open polygons and polygons with holes inside it and generates an output of all the yellow dot's locations (vector3's with x and z as it lies at 0 on the y plane) for my triangulation code.</p>

<p>I'm still looking up way to figure this out but I haven't come up with even where to start looking for solutions. Thanks for all the help.</p>

<p>OLD QUESTION BELOW</p>

<p>I'm trying to find a way to link points together to form an internal polygon. Basically, I'm creating a program that lets people link lines together. After a closed polygon is made, it is supposed to generate a new polygon object inside the lines.</p>

<p>I'm not too sure how to do this - I have made it so they can generate the lines and link them together, but how to do a closed polygon escapes me. I looked at convex hulls but this isn't the same, and tried looking or thinking up a few different things that don't seem to work. I'm curious if anyone can point me in the write direction/a tutorial or idea on how to continue on my creation. </p>

<p>I have two pictures uploaded to help show my point.</p>

<p>Above is what I am trying to do but not too sure how - basically, when the user finished a closed polygon (all the yellow dots are the polygon's external points), I want it to generate an internal polygon (marked by the black 1, 2 and 3). Thanks for anyone's help.</p>

My stream looks like below :</p>

<p>Now the problem is that this URL presents spring-xd with a certificate that does not match with the hostname I am trying to hit. The certificate is named something like abc.mycompany.com, whereas the URL's hostname is remoteHost.</p>

<p>Spring XD throws :
<strong>java.security.cert.CertificateException: No name matching remoteHost found</strong>.</p>

<p>My cacerts does have the abc.mycompany.com certificate added.</p>

<p>I need to know if there is a way I can disable SpringXD from verifying hostname with CN while establishing SSL connection.

<p>How can I do to open exactly that url?</p>

<p>I tried encoding the <code>#</code> character, but that does not seem to be working.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>
I know what the URL is, what the fragment is, and all of it. What I'm asking is if there is a way to override what the <code>Uri</code> class does. (To take the Uri, and remove what is after <code>#</code> and place it in the <code>Fragment</code> property, etc), so I can query that url, instead of the modified url.</p>

The kind of behaviour I'm referring to is the same thing in the intro video of <a href=""http://flipboard.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flipboard.com/</a></p>

<p>When the window is resized, the video still takes up 100% of the viewable size (without scrolling). I noticed that the video gets resized to a certain degree, but stops resizing and gets cropped at some point.</p>

<p>What is the best way to get the same behaviour? I want to have a video take up the entire viewable area of the browser without scroll bars. This is only on a desktop/laptop, I am not considering any mobile devices ATM.</p>

<p>What I have in mind right now is to dynamically change the width/height properties of the video to fit the viewable area using javascript, but also set a minimum size such that the video doesn't get distorted. The video can be placed in a container that is always centered, so if the browser gets to a size that is too small, it effectively gets cropped. I'm not sure if this is too long-winded and if there is an easier way.</p>

<p>I am calling the method in jScript and it works just fine but the loading gif does not appear so it makes it feel like nothing it happening until my user prompt message appears.</p>

<p>Is there anyway I can call the loading gif in my code?</p>

<p>My jScript is pretty straight forward:</p>

<pre><code>// handler for submit button calling page method
    $addHandler($get('SendEmailPageMethod'), 'click', EmailPageMethod);
});

function EmailPageMethod() {
    var name = $get('name').value;
    var email = $get('email').value;
    var message = $get('message').value;

    PageMethods.SendEmail(name, email, message, SuccessCallback, ErrorCallback);
}

function SuccessCallback(resultString) {
    $('#innerForm').addClass('hidden');
    $('div.successMsg').removeClass('hidden');
    //alert(String(resultString));
}

function ErrorCallback(resultString) {
    alert(String(resultString));
    parent.jQuery.colorbox.close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This jScript is on the parent page that opens the colorbox window:</p>

<pre><code>                // handles colorbox for contact form
                $('#contact-form').colorbox({ maxWidth: '75%',
                    close: '',
                    // removes selected class from contact menu item on close
                    onClosed: function () {
                        $('#contact-form').removeClass('selected');
                    }
                });
</code></pre>

<p>This is what the jScript console says when I open the colorbox form and submit it.</p>

"21701051","1","21701278","","2014-02-11 11:51:12","","0","66","<p>So I'm writing some code that computes the cost of various public transport ticket options over a multi-segment journey.  This boils down to computing the cost of each segment (map) and summing them together (reduce aka inject), which is simple enough:</p>

<pre><code>total = journey.map {|segment| compute segment}.reduce(:+)
</code></pre>

<p>Problem is, sometimes <code>compute</code> returns <code>nil</code> because the segment is not possible for a given ticket, and then the sum operation blows up.  In this case I want to return that <code>nil</code> instead, because a single bad segment means the whole journey is invalid.  Currently I'm doing this:</p>

<pre><code>fares = journey.map {|segment| compute segment}
total = if fares.include? nil
  nil
else
  fares.reduce(:+)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Which I can also write as the terse but (IMHO) less readable:</p>

<pre><code>fares = journey.map {|segment| compute segment}
total = fares.reduce{|sum, n| (sum.nil? or n.nil?) ? nil : sum + n}
</code></pre>

<p>But there has to be a nicer way, right...?</p>

<p>I have a program mainLex.c which contains this loop:</p>

<pre><code>for (;;)  {
    printf (""(%d)$ "", ncmd);                // Prompt for command
    if ((line = getLine(stdin)) == NULL)    // Read line
        break;                              // Break on end of file

    cmd = hExpand (line, &amp;status);          // Expand line
    free (line);
    if (status &gt; 0)                         // Substitution?
        fputs (cmd, stdout);                //   Print expanded line
    else if (status &lt; 0)
        fputs (""substitution failed\n"", stderr);

    list = lex (cmd);                       // Lex line into tokens
    free (cmd);
    if (list == NULL)                       // Empty token list?
        continue;

    hRemember (ncmd, list);                 // Remember command
    if (status &gt;= 0)                        // No substitution error?
        process (list);                     //   Process token list

    freeList (list);                        // Free token list
    ncmd++;                                 // Adjust prompt
    }
</code></pre>

<p>After running through the loop once, the method is supposed to free the list at freeList, then ask for a new string to use as list. This is all well and good, but I'm finding that freeList is freeing things that I'm not asking it to! In particular, it is freeing a global static data structure llist, and I'm not sure how this is happening.</p>

<p>The code for freeList:</p>

<pre><code>void freeList (token *list)
{
    token *p, *pnext;
    for (p = list;  p;  p = pnext)  {
        pnext = p-&gt;next;
        free(p-&gt;text);
        free(p); //This is apparently where the data structure is being freed
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>hRemember:</p>

<pre><code>void hRemember (int ncmd, token *list)
{
    command* curr;
    curr = (struct command *)malloc(sizeof(struct command));
    token *list1 = malloc(sizeof(token));
    list1=list;
    f = ncmd;
    curr-&gt;cmmd=(struct token *)malloc(sizeof(struct token));
    curr-&gt;cmmd=list1;
    curr-&gt;num=ncmd;
    curr-&gt;prev=llist;
    if (llist==NULL)
    {
        llist = (struct command *)malloc(sizeof(struct command));
    }
    llist-&gt;nextcmd=curr;
    llist=curr;
}
</code></pre>

<p>llist:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct command {          // Struct for each token in linked list
    token *cmmd;                   //   String containing token
    int num;                     //   Corresponding type
    struct command *prev;
    struct command *nextcmd;      //   Pointer to next token in linked list
} command;


command* llist = NULL; //This is global in a different c file than the loop
</code></pre>

<p>After I try to read llist's contents after one version of the loop, this is what comes up:</p>

<pre><code>==12878== Invalid read of size 8
==12878==    at 0x400DB5: hDump (Lex1.c:153)

==12878==    by 0x400B18: main (mainLex.c:43)
==12878== 
==12878== Invalid read of size 1
</code></pre>

<p>If possible, I would like to not change either the loop or freeList.</p>

<p>I've tried everything, and I can't find a way to convert this code to work inside a JPanel.  I need to use a JPanel in my applet so that my cameras don't show up in a new, separate window (JFrame).  </p>

<p>Does anyone know how to convert (just a small portion of) this code to draw and refresh my images in a JPanel?  </p>

<p>Thanks (in advance)! </p>

However I cannot even get it set up to run the example code provided. I have a 64-bit windows computer and I downloaded the 64 bit SDK. I am using C++ in Visual Studio 2013. I created a project and added the include and lib64 directories to the project. My code so far looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""FlyCapture2.h""
using namespace FlyCapture2;
int main()
{
    Camera cam;
    Error errors;
    FC2Version version;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, very minimalist. The <code>Error</code> and <code>FC2Version</code> classes show up fine but the <code>Camera</code> class does not, even though I can see that it is included in the header. I even tried explicitly <code>#include ""Camera.h""</code> but it still doesn't work. When I opened the <code>""Camera.h""</code> file inside Visual Studio to get a look inside, the class definition of Camera is there as expected, but in the line <code>class FLYCAPTURE2_API Camera : public CameraBase</code>, the <code>FLYCAPTURE2_API</code> is underlined and Visual Studio gives the following error: <code>Error: expected a type specifier</code> even though I haven't changed the file since I downloaded it. </p>

<p>The other two classes load fine but I can't even get this minimalist setup code to work. I'm sure my mistake is something simple I just can't seem to figure out what it is. </p>

It supports uploading a CSV file and upon successful upload (using JQuery File upload) immediately rendering it into HTML on the same page. This works fine when I set the $filePath as per example below. However, I wish to pass in this value as a hidden field and retrieve it by using the .attr method. However when I do this the CSV to table does not seem to render properly and the page seems to hang with the loadingImage (update still works), and the 'loadComplete' function is not executed (as per alert in example below).</p>

<p>I can get it working as follows (see the lines in bold):</p>

<pre><code>    }).bind('fileuploadcompleted', function (e, data) {        
        var $filename = $.trim($('#fileupload td.name').text());
        **var $filePath = 'bundles/jqueryfileupload/users/';
        //var $filepath = $('#upload_path_id').attr('value');**
        $.get($filePath + $filename, function(data) {
            $('#CSVSource').html('&lt;pre&gt;' + data + '&lt;/pre&gt;');
        });
        $('#CSVTable').CSVToTable($filePath + $filename,{
          loadingImage: 'bundles/jqueryfileupload/img/loading-table.gif',
          startLine: 0 }             
        ).bind(""loadComplete"",function() {
              alert('load complete!');
              $('button.btn.import').removeClass('disabled').addClass('ready');
              $('div.alert.alert-info').show();
        });
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea how I can get around this issue?</p>

<p>UPDATE: It looks like the issue exists because I am retrieving an absolute path and this is failing with the ajax call that renders the csv to HTML. I'm using Laravel and have updated the paths.php file to include the following entry:</p>

<pre><code>// --------------------------------------------------------------
// The path to the storage/users directory.
// --------------------------------------------------------------
$paths['user_files'] = 'storage/users';
</code></pre>

<p>then in my view file I am passing in the file path as a hidden field as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""hidden"" id=""upload_path_id"" name=""upload_path"" value={{ path('user_files') }}&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>so my question is if I'm using both Laravel and Xampp locally on my machine is there a way to get this working with ajax either as a relative path or some other way?  The folder I'm using above is part of Laravel (i.e. under 'storage') and is ABOVE the public directory.</p>

<p>Any help on this would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>i only set to the user the session user_id as the user id when logged in... like</p>

<pre><code>$_SESSION[""user_id""] = 1;//fetched via the user login details

<p>it automatically does that...</p>

<p>Also when i do an ajax request my sessions get lost with no reason...</p>

<p>this happens on LIVE server but not on localhost.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> i noticed that my sessions get mixed up within the server folders, i have 2 apps using the same session to store the logged in user ID(user_id is the session name), so when i log in on first app and go to 2nd i appear as logged in even if i am not registered)... so why this happens?</p>

This is exactly what my fonts are doing, but I'm trying to find out if there's a way to prevent this using html or css or anything web-based.</p>

<p>I'm using ""platin"" as my font. Do I just need to find a different font?</p>

<p>Any other thoughts on the topic?</p>

<p>Its on a joomla 1.6 installation (mootools 1.3) with a joomlart t3 template and a couple of ja modules. Other than that I have my own custom component, nothing special. With a bunch of code that runs when dom is ready. I'v spent many an hour trying to work out why domready is executed twice but to no avail.</p>

<p>Anyone got any ideas on what may be causing this? Or experienced something similar?</p>

<p>Edit:
After some further testing on PC in Firefox, IE, Chrome, Opera and Safari I found the issue is only present on Chrome and Safari. Being a Mac user using both Chrome and Safari for my dev I assumed it was an issues in all browsers (stupid assumption on my part). I'm running Chrome 12.0.742.112 and Safari 5.0.5 (6533.21.1) if you still dont get the same results as I described above.</p>
