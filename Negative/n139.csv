I googled and understood that View.OnLongClickListener can be used to call a method when the user long presses in the application. However, I am stuck at coming at a solution to make the TextView to shift it based on the exact location where the user long presses.</p>

<p>I have implemented the condition to check for a long press from the user. Any idea on how to make the TextVIew appear where the user long presses? I want the TextView to appear exactly where the user long presses.</p>

<pre><code>findViewById(R.id.myimage).setOnLongClickListener(new View.OnLongClickListener() {

        @Override
        public boolean onLongClick(View v) {
            showNameInCustomPosition();// Method to call to when user long presses
            return false;
        }
    });

I am using angular 1.3.15, with Firebase 2.2.4 and AngularFire 1.1.1.</p>

<p>I have a factory to return a reference to the proper Firebase (https://.firebaseio.com</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('MyModule')
    .constant('FIREBASE_URL', 'https://xxxxxxxxx.firebaseio.com/');

angular.module('MyModule')
    .factory('GetFireBaseObject', function(FIREBASE_URL) {
        return {
            BaseURL: function() {
                return new Firebase(FIREBASE_URL);
            },
            DataURL: function(Node) {
                return new Firebase(FIREBASE_URL + Node);
            }
        };
    }
);
</code></pre>

<p>Then the controller is trying to get data from the factory.</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('MyModule').factory(""StoresData"", [""$firebaseArray"", ""GetFireBaseObject"", 
    function($firebaseArray, GetFireBaseObject) {
        var StoresData = GetFireBaseObject.DataURL('Stores/');

        return {
            AllStores: function() {
                return $firebaseArray(StoresData);
            },
            OneStore: function(StoreKey) {
                var StoreKeyNo = parseInt(StoreKey);
                return $firebaseArray(StoresData.child(StoreKeyNo));
            }
        };
    }
]);
</code></pre>

<p>The AllStores reference call will return everything.  However, I do not get a record using the OneStore call.  I have validated that my keys are numeric in the Firebase structure (no quotes), but still this does not find the record.</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('MyModule').controller('StoreCtrl', ['$scope', ""StoresData"",
    function ($scope, StoresData) {

        $scope.Stores = StoresData.AllStores();
        $scope.store = {};

        $scope.DeleteStore = function(StoreId) {
            $scope.Stores.$remove(StoreId);
        };

        $scope.SaveStore = function(store) {
            store.$id = store.Key;   // Integer Value
            $scope.Stores.push(store);
            $scope.Stores.$save(store);

            $scope.store.Key = """";
            $scope.store.Description = """";
        };

        $scope.SelectStore = function(StoreId) {
            var OneStore = StoresData.OneStore(StoreId);
            $scope.store.Key = OneStore.Key;
            $scope.store.Description = OneStore.Description;
        };

    }
]);
</code></pre>

<p>I am not seeing anything returned in the debugger or on screen. I am not even worried about the update right now, just trying to get a select to work.  I have validated that the HTML is returning the proper Key for the record I am trying to access.</p>

<p>Changing OneStore to:</p>

<pre><code>            OneStore: function(StoreKey) {
                var StoresData = GetFireBaseObject.DataURL('Stores/' + StoreKey);
                return new $firebaseArray(StoresData);
</code></pre>

<p>does not work either. The data returned is an empty array.</p>

<p>This code is working fine but some time if mysql is busy then it takes time to return the value to calling application.
So I droped the idea and start Async communication.</p>

    });
    }

    return ""1"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>I started using the code something like this. So that calling party can get the response immediately(reduce the response time) and later on my application continue to work. But in First code i test the load with JMeter(20 req/sec ) and found it is working fine with cpu load(3%). But in second code  with same load cpu load is going to more than 100%.Than i started using the ThreadPoolTaskExecutor with below configuration.</p>

<pre><code>@AutoWired
private ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor;

@RequestMappint(""/save"")

//Assume this code is in MyRunnableWorker Class

        CallReporting callReporting = new CallReporting();
        callReporting.setName(map.get(""name""));
        so---on (have 15 field)
        commonService.save(callReporting);

    MyRunnableWorker worker = new MyRunnableWorker();
    executor.execute(worker)

    &lt;property name=""queueCapacity"" value=""200"" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but found the same result. Whats wrong with code can somebody suggest me. One important thing when i test with Jmeter in stage envorment then load is moving between 30% to 70%.. But in production server it is always around 100%. It is java consuming 100% other process is quite low.
Production machine haveing linux OS. hexacore processer having 128 GB RAM.
Can some one tell me what to do.</p>

When my linux boots up into user space, I know where are my devices in the physical memory. I want to map them into user space virtual addresses. Currently, I am doing it through a kernel module. I use vmalloc/kmalloc (depending on the size) and then I use ioremap_page_range on that returned virtual addresses to map my physical addresses. I dont think that is the correct way to go about. First of all I am allocating memory and then I am asking kernel to remap that virtual address space to some different physical address space. (Initially mapped physical->virtual in vmcall/kmalloc is kinda useless as I dont care about those physical pages. This is definitely not good.)</p>

<p>Instead of this is there a better way to map the known physical memory into user space process. (I know other than my user space process, no one gonna touch that memory.)</p>

"15906464","1","","","2013-04-09 15:44:23","","0","348","<p>I am working on VSTO add-ins for excel and document level customizations.  They will be used on computers with several users (10 or so each).  By intention, we do want common database and report files on a server folder, instead we want all 10 users to be able to access a local database and reports (local to computer).  Right now I am doing this by a two step install.</p>

<p>First an InstallShield project unpacts all the ClickOnce files, default templates, and database files to <code>c:\LIMSersTestUnit</code> .  ""Running the application when finished"" runs the SetUp.exe from the ClickOnce file.  I am not having user use problems, perhaps because everything is launched from within a main document level customization.  IE I've used this method and had multiple users login and successfully use the program.  My problem is that in deploying this it has been cumbersome to rely on users to do this successfully.  My first stab was to just include everything in a zip file and tell them to unzip it into the correct directory, but that was a disaster.</p>

<p>I would like to combine this into one install if possible.  I understand that a folder of files can be included <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kzy0fky2%28v=vs.80%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">with the VSTO project</a> but this is put into a user specific folder.  I have not been able to figure out how to change this output path relative to root.  I'm still doing a lot of Googling on this, but I'm not even sure if it's possible.</p>

<p>On the flip side, I've not been able to get InstallShield to properly install the document level customization.  I've been trying to find an example of this online and so far I have failed.  I've tried including the manfests from the ClickOnce publication, along with the primary outputs of the VSTO project, but I've gotten no where.  I'm currently examining the registry and files created by the ClickOnce install to try and clone it.  It does a lot more on the security side of things than I realized.  I tried changing the registry path for the Excel Add-in to under <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6647522/vsto-outlook-2007-deployment-for-all-userr"">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</a>, but that so far hasn't helped.</p>

<p>So my distilled questions are: 
Can I deploy files to a folder based on root path with ClickOnce? If so how?
Is there an obvious way or example of how to deploy a VSTO with InstallShield? I found <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vsto/ff937654.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> but I haven't been able to get it work.  I am still working that end though.  If anyone knows of a better guide, please let me know.</p>

First of all I well aware of all the Obj-C / Apple memory management rules, (I will state this first, so I am not wasting anyones time, and they are not wasting mine)</p>

<p>So I will ask this straight out... is there some practical limit regarding the ""Autorelease"" mechanism attached to reusing UITableViewCell's..? Because I only seem to be experiencing the crash after a certain number, usually over 50 pages worth of cells (around 50 pages + 50 cells) get turned over... Then out of no-where I will get this crash.. Sometimes never happens at all, sometimes happens quite frequently, depending on content density...</p>

<p>Would it be better to start manually retaining and releasing on my own..?
If so, would someone have the experience to recommend a good place to release them..?</p>

<p>Ok.... I failed to find anything to do with the actual UITableViewCell (Cell contents or cell itself) but after adding a few retains to the Controller (which instantiates the UITableView Object) the ""crash"" mysteriously stopped showing up...</p>

<p>Here's what I changed. Basically I added three Retain statements, which by the way, I used  the original Example tutorial on ""How To"" - ""UITabBarController"" from a Self Proclaimed ""Iphone Expert"", but the ""expert"" negated to include the retains....

<p>So <code>time.Now().Unix()</code> tells me the unix timestamp is <strong>1257894000</strong> whereas my browser tells me it is <strong>1398351437</strong>. Also www.unixtimestamp.de tells me it is <strong>1398351704</strong> which is what I would expect. Why is the one coming from Go so far off? I get the same results on my local machine btw. </p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

<p>Ok, turns out it was really only an issue on play.golang.org. I thought I tested it locally as well but I had another look now and yes on my local machine everything is correct. </p>

<p>I am able to use it no problem with Twitter, but I can't figure out how to get it to work with Google OAuth 2.0.  The code I'm trying to use is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$config = array(
        'callbackUrl' =&gt; 'https://www.example.com/callback',
        'siteUrl' =&gt; 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2',
        'userAuthorizationUrl' =&gt; 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth',
        'requestTokenUrl' =&gt; 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token',
        'consumerKey' =&gt; 'MY-CONSUMER-KEY-HERE',
        'consumerSecret' =&gt; 'MY-SECRET-KEY-HERE',
        'version' =&gt; '2.0',
    );

    $scopes = array(
        'https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo'
    );

    $consumer = new Consumer($config);
    $token = $consumer-&gt;getRequestToken(array('scope' =&gt; implode('', $scopes), 'response_type' =&gt; 'code', 'redirect_uri' =&gt; 'https://www.example.com/callback'));
    $consumer-&gt;redirect();
</code></pre>

<p>According to the documentation for ZendOAuth, an array in the getRequestToken function gets treated as custom OAuth parameters.  However, when I run this code I get redirected to a Google page that says:</p>

<p><strong>Required parameter is missing: response_type</strong></p>

<p>The URL in the browser shows the following:</p>

<p><a href=""https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?oauth_token=&amp;oauth_callback=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2Fcallback"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?oauth_token=&amp;oauth_callback=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2Fcallback</a></p>

<p>I've tried throwing debug statements around in the ZendOAuth library, but I can't seem to be able to find the problem.</p>

<p>If anyone has a solution to this, it would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

Upon reading the Analytics Configuration Reference, I see that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Analytics profiles differ from security profiles and analytics tags.
  Analytics profiles apply to individual sessions in individual Web
  clients rather than to users or global sessions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to accumulate scores for users based on the Global Session, but looking at the API in reflector, it appears that there is no relationship defined between the Session and GlobalSession objects... it looks like I will need to join Session and GlobalSession at the data layer, get a list of Sessions there and then build my own conditional rules for rendering, rather than use an API method or anything else baked in. </p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is my understanding correct?</li>
<li>Are any other people trying to track users across sessions, using anything other than 'tags'?</li>

<p>And if with JPA you can't do a batch update, what if I don't use transaction, and just use the following flow:</p>

<pre><code>em = emf.getEntityManager
// do some query
// make some data modification
em.persist(..)
// do some query
// make some data modification
em.persist(..)
// do some query
// make some data modification
em.persist(..)
...
em.close()
</code></pre>

<p>How does this compare to batch update with regard to performance, and compare to a single transaction commit, measured by RPC calls to datastore server, CPU cycles per request, or so. Does every call to em.persist(..) before em.close() trigger a RPC call to the datastore server?</p>

"21518067","1","21534838","","2014-02-03 00:20:58","","1","273","<h2>INTRODUCTION AND RELEVANT INFORMATION:</h2>

<p>I have <code>MS Access 2007</code> database which I fill using <code>ADO</code>. </p>

<p>Among other data types ( <code>string</code>, <code>integer</code>...) I also have a <code>double</code>. </p>

<p>Since I work on <code>Windows XP</code> and use pure <code>Win32 API</code> to create GUI, I collect data from <code>edit</code> controls with <code>GetDlgItemText API</code> and then I convert that text into <code>double</code> using <code>_wtof_l</code>. </p>

<h2>PROBLEM:</h2>

<p>Everything works well if the user sets English or Serbian ( we use European notation for decimal and group separator ) locale and <strong>then starts the program</strong>, but the problem occurs when user changes locale settings <strong>while the program is working.</strong></p>

<p>Let me demonstrate this on a small example:</p>

<p>Let us assume that user has English locale set. </p>

<p>Then user starts my application.</p>

<p>Then user decides to change the locale ( <code>Control Panel-&gt;Regional and Language Settings</code> for <code>Windows XP</code> ) before he hits the ""Save"" button.</p>

<p>After the changes apply he then enters data and then hits ""save"".</p>

<p>The error in converting text to <code>double</code> must occur ( <code>_wtof_l</code> will now truncate <code>1.25</code> to <code>1</code> ), since my program uses default <code>ANSI ""C"" locale</code> and did not adapt it to reflect users modification.</p>

<h2>MY EFFORTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM:</h2>

<p>To prevent this I need to adapt my program to the possibility described above-I need to set my locale to the one user selected before executing query.</p>

<p>To do so I use <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21504075/is-there-a-message-or-notification-in-win32-that-detects-when-user-changes-local"">message from answer to my previous question</a> to detect when user changes settings in <code>Control Panel-&gt;Regional and Language Options</code>. </p>

<p>Then I use <code>_wsetlocale(LC_ALL,"""")</code> to set my applications locale to the one selected by the user.</p>

<p>However, wrong conversion from text to decimal number described above still occurs. </p>

<p>This only happens when I change the locale during my program's work. If I leave locale untouched ( as 99.9% of users will ) everything seems to work fine.</p>

<p>To further help the community I have made a demo application that illustrates the problem.
It will be presented in the <strong>APPENDIX</strong> section at the end of this post.</p>

<h2>QUESTION:</h2>

<p>How can I respond to <code>WM_SETTINGCHANGE</code> message to set my application's locale to the one currently selected by the user so my ""save"" button handler can perform proper conversion from <code>string</code> to <code>double</code> with <code>_wtof_l</code> function? </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Best regards.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX:</h2>

<p>Steps to create the demo application that illustrates my problem:</p>

<p>1.Create <code>default Win32 project</code> in <code>Visual Studio</code>.</p>

<p>2.Add the following <code>WM_CREATE</code> handler:</p>

<pre><code>case WM_CREATE:
    {
        _wsetlocale( LC_ALL, L"""" ); //set current locale at window creation

        INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX iccex;
        memset( &amp;iccex, 0, sizeof(INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX) );
        iccex.dwSize = sizeof(INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX);
        iccex.dwICC = ICC_STANDARD_CLASSES | ICC_TAB_CLASSES | ICC_BAR_CLASSES;
        InitCommonControlsEx( &amp;iccex );

        // text

        HWND hEdit = CreateWindowEx( 0, L""Edit"", L"""", 
                         WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_BORDER | ES_AUTOHSCROLL,
                         50, 50, 150, 25, hWnd, (HMENU)8002, hInst, 0 );

        // decimal number

        HWND hEdit1 = CreateWindowEx( 0, L""Edit"", L"""", 
                         WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_BORDER | ES_AUTOHSCROLL,
                         250, 50, 150, 25, hWnd, (HMENU)8003, hInst, 0 );

        HWND hButton = CreateWindowEx( 0, L""Button"", L""Save"", 
                         WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_BORDER | BS_PUSHBUTTON,
                         50, 150, 150, 25, hWnd, (HMENU)8004, hInst, 0 );

        SendMessage( hEdit, EM_LIMITTEXT, (WPARAM)9, (LPARAM)0 );
        SendMessage( hEdit1, EM_LIMITTEXT, (WPARAM)4, (LPARAM)0 );

    }
    return 0L;
</code></pre>

<p>3.Add the following handler to detect when user changes locale settings</p>

<pre><code>case WM_SETTINGCHANGE:
    if( !wParam &amp;&amp; !wcscmp( (wchar_t*)lParam, L""intl"" ) )
    {
        _wsetlocale( LC_ALL, L"""" ); //set it to current locale
        return 0L; // ""say"" we handled it
    }
    else
        break; // pass it to default window procedure
</code></pre>

<p>4.In <code>WM_COMMAND</code> handler add the following <code>case</code>s:</p>

<pre><code>case 8004:
    {
        // initialize COM
        HRESULT hr = CoInitialize(NULL);

            if ( SUCCEEDED(hr) )
            {
                wchar_t text[10], number[5];

                memset( &amp;text, L'\0', sizeof(text) );
                memset( &amp;number, L'\0', sizeof(number) );

                GetDlgItemText( hWnd, 8002, text, 10 );    // text
                GetDlgItemText( hWnd, 8003, number, 5 );   // double

                ADODB::_CommandPtr pCmd(""ADODB.Command"");

                pCmd-&gt;ActiveConnection = pConn;

                                    _wtof_l( number, _get_current_locale() ) ) );
               pCmd-&gt;Parameters-&gt;Append( pCmd-&gt;CreateParameter( ""?"",
                                    ADODB::adVarWChar, ADODB::adParamInput, 
                                    wcslen(text), text ) );
               pCmd-&gt;Execute( NULL, NULL, ADODB::adCmdText );

               pConn-&gt;Close(); // close connection

               CoUninitialize(); // uninitialize COM
            }
            else
                throw _com_error(hr); //something failed-report it
        }
        catch(_com_error&amp; e)
        {
            MessageBox(hWnd, (LPWSTR)(e.Description()), L""Error"", MB_OK | 
                MB_ICONERROR );

            CoUninitialize();

For example, if numbers is {12, 34, 50, 67, 88}, provide code that will alter numbers so that its contents now become {88, 67, 50, 34, 12}.</p>

<p><strong>This is what I have</strong>
it is not working correctly.</p>

<pre><code>public static int[] reverseArrayWithoutTempArray(int[] array) {

        double array [ ];

        array = new double [10];
        int [ ] num = {12, 34, 50, 67, 88};
        int i = 0;
        int  j = a.length - 1;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; a.length / 2; i++, j—){
            int temp = a[i];
            a[i] = a[j];
            a[j] = temp;
          }
        return array;
    }
</code></pre>

Right now I kind of hacked things together to make it work, intercepting change events and updating the display. However I'm thinking a better way would be to make a model that has the two numbers and somehow link this model to my GUI view. I know how to make a model, but am kind of lost on how I could link that to my GUI view... any suggestions?</p>

<p><strong>update:</strong> my model is ready + includes firing property changes. I think I would like to use some kind of data binding approach (e.g. JGoodies Binding) but I am not sure how... JGoodies Binding doesn't support sliders.</p>

<p>edit: also note, when the slider changes position, the text field should change its value; when the text field changes value, the slider should change position; and when the model changes value, both text field + slider should update.</p>

<p>And as a bonus, it would be also be helpful if you can point out to me how to get canvas on which it is painted on looks realistic, and blended with the paint? Does <code>Blending/GLSL</code> have to do with any of this?</p>

The clustering was applied to detect different color regions in the original image. Here is one example of the resulting clusters, </p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/C86Wk.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/C86Wk.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The colored region (purple) is the shape of the cluster in original the 2D image. I want to be able to detect (and store) the shape of this cluster and apply it to another picture. To elaborate more, after capturing this shape I want to draw (or construct) a region with a similar shape in another image and apply the same color to it. </p>

<p>I have searched for this detecting ability in MATLAB, but most of the algorithms I found detect regular shapes like squares, and circles. I tried to use active activecontour as suggested by the answer here, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20284678/random-object-detection-matlab"">Random object detection matlab</a>. Based on the <strong>first</strong> code provided at MATLAB website here, <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/activecontour.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/activecontour.html</a>, I've written this code, </p>

<pre><code>I = imread('clusterimg.png');
imshow(I)
title('Original Image');

mask = zeros(size(I));
mask(25:end-25,25:end-25) = 1;

figure, imshow(mask);
title('Initial Contour Location');

bw = activecontour(I,mask,300);

figure, imshow(bw);
title('Segmented Image');
</code></pre>

<p>But, when I run it I get this error, </p>

<pre><code>Undefined function 'activecontour' for input arguments of type 'uint8'.
Error in geometrydetection (line 11)
bw = activecontour(I,mask,300); 
</code></pre>

<p>What I need to know is the following, </p>

<p>1- What mistake I did in the code above?</p>

<p>2- Is <code>activecontour</code> a good way to achieve the geometry detection I described above? If yes, after detecting the geometry of a region, how can I construct a similar one in another image? If no, can you please provided an alternative method that can detect the geometry of a region, and construct a similar one in another image?</p>

<p>EDIT: The suggestion of using <code>bwconncomp</code> by <strong>mvai</strong> may be good. I've found this example (available here, <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/labeling-and-measuring-objects-in-a-binary-image.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/labeling-and-measuring-objects-in-a-binary-image.html</a>),</p>

<p>The ""<em>&amp;hosted_button_id=XXXXXXXXXXXXX</em>"" is not being saved, which means users cannot purchase my client's product.</p>

<p>Potential solution: I've been digging through the theme's .php files, looking for an opportunity to intercept the value being passed to the WordPress database.

"6303244","1","6303327","","2011-06-10 07:27:56","","1","911","<p>In our intranet ASP .NET application we use an architecture approach which is similar to the MVVM pattern.
Our viewmodel, which describes the state of the view, is either created or loaded in Page_Load from the ViewState.
Depending on the viewmodel content the page then is dynamically created.
Right now I am facing a problem where I cannot find an elegant solution.</p>

<p>The problem is that we have to handle events that are fired by the controls, which are dynamically created in the ListView. However, those registered events do only fire, if the listView is databound in Page_Init. If the databinding takes place in Page_Load those events are not fired.
The thing now is, that we need our ViewModel in order to databind the ListView to it. This ViewModel is cached in the ViewState, which - to my knowledge - only comes accessible in Page_Load. That means that in Page_Init we cannot access the ViewModel.</p>

<p>I created the following example:</p>

<p>ASP:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""form1"" runat=""server""&gt;
    &lt;asp:ListView runat=""server"" ID=""lstView"" ItemPlaceholderID=""itemPlaceHolder""&gt;
        &lt;LayoutTemplate&gt;
            &lt;asp:PlaceHolder runat=""server"" ID=""itemPlaceHolder"" /&gt;
        &lt;/LayoutTemplate&gt;
        &lt;ItemTemplate&gt;
            &lt;asp:DropDownList runat=""server"" ID=""dropDown"" SelectedValue='&lt;%# Bind(""SelectedValue"") %&gt;' DataSource='&lt;%# Eval(""Choice"") %&gt;' AutoPostBack=""true"" /&gt;
        &lt;/ItemTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/asp:ListView&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

<ul>
<li>Requests to the root folder (e.g. <a href=""http://mysite.com/"">http://mysite.com/</a> and <a href=""http://mysite.com/help"">http://mysite.com/help</a>) are served by the apache itself (PHP/Wordpress).</li>
<li>Specific requests to the '/playapp' subfolder are forwarded to Play! via a reverse proxy via mod-proxy:</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>mod-proxy.conf</strong></p>

<pre><code>ProxyPass        /playapp/ http://localhost:9000/
ProxyPassReverse /playapp/ http://localhost:9000/
</code></pre>

<p>The end result is that requests to say <code>http://mysite.com/playapp/Controller/action</code> reach the Play server as <code>http://localhost:9000/Controller/action</code></p>

<p>Now, Play! serves the page correctly, but all links, including javascript, css and links to other pages, are broken. For example, if a view uses:</p>

<pre><code>#{stylesheet 'style.css' /}
</code></pre>

<p>Then the rendered result is </p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""/public/stylesheets/style.css"" charset=""utf-8"" &gt;&lt;/link&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So the end user tries to fetches <code>http://mysite.com/public/stylesheets/style.css</code>, which returns a 404 because it's not actually part of the Play! app.</p>

<p>What's the correct way to configure Apache + Play to play along here?</p>

<p>The result I'm looking for is for Play! to return URLs such as this in the final rendered HTML (or perhaps for Apache to rewrite the URLs accordingly): <code>http://mysite.com/playapp/public/stylesheets/style.css</code></p>

<p>Also, I do need some ability to link outside of the Play app. For example, I want the home route (/) to be mapped to my absolute root (<code>http://mysite.com/</code>), not to Play's root.</p>

<p>The content type of my response should always be <code>application/json</code> as I've it set for the <code>get</code> request. However, what I'm getting in my tests is <code>text/plain</code>. How do I set the content type correctly in the response?</p>

<p>On a side note, the akka-http documentation is one of the most worthless piece of garbage I've ever seen. Almost every link to example code is broken and their explanations merely state the obvious. Javadoc has no code example and I couldn't find their codebase on Github so learning from their unit tests is also out of the question.</p>

<p>Is this the best way to insert into oracle database having several multiple sql statement for insertion.

I am especially interested in cases where the lambda implements a generic superinterface. In the code example below, <code>MapFunction&lt;F, T&gt;</code> is the generic superinterface, and I am looking for a way to find out what type binds to the generic parameter <code>T</code>.</p>

<p>While Java throws away a lot of generic type information after the compiler, subclasses (and anonymous subclasses) of generic superclasses and generic superinterfaces did preserve that type information. Via reflection, these types were accessible. In the example below <em>(case 1)</em>, reflection tells my that the <code>MyMapper</code> implementation of <code>MapFunction</code> binds <code>java.lang.Integer</code> to the generic type parameter <code>T</code>.</p>

<p>Even for subclasses that are themselves generic, there are certain means to find out what binds to a generic parameter, if some others are known. Consider <em>case 2</em> in the example below, the <code>IdentityMapper</code> where both <code>F</code> and <code>T</code> bind to the same type. When we know that, we know the type <code>F</code> if we know the parameter type <code>T</code> (which in my case we do).</p>

<p>The question is now, how can I realize something similar for the Java 8 lambdas? Since they are actually not regular subclasses of the generic superinterface, the above described method does not work.
Specifically, can I figure out that the <code>parseLambda</code> binds <code>java.lang.Integer</code> to <code>T</code>, and the <code>identityLambda</code> binds the same to <code>F</code> and <code>T</code>?</p>

<p>PS: In theory it should possible to decompile the lambda code and then use an embedded compiler (like the JDT) and tap into its type inference. I hope that there is a simpler way to do this ;-)</p>

<p>For example, the first app tutorial I went through has you modify the activity_main.xml to include:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;EditText android:id=""@+id/edit_message""
    android:layout_width=""0dp""
    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
    android:hint=""@string/edit_message""
    android:layout_weight=""1"" /&gt;

&lt;Button
    android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
    android:text=""@string/button_send""
    android:onClick=""sendMessage"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Am I correct in understanding that these (EditText, Button) elements themselves are individual Views?  In other words, the above code contains two ""Views"", and not two ""controls""?  Later in the code we run into something called a TextView, which directly has the word ""View"" in it, while the others do not, which kinda threw me off.</p>

<p>My only other experience is in ASP.Net and C# web development, so I guess my question could be phrased as, are Android ""Views"" equivalent to ASP.Net Web Controls (asp:DropDownList, asp:Button, etc.)?  If I wanted to add more controls to the above code, like more Buttons for example, would I say, ""I'm going to add more Views to this Layout?""  Or would it be, ""I'm going to add more controls to this View?""  Or...?</p>

                Elements links = doc.select(""ul li"");
                List list = new List(false, 20);

<p>but by doing this, it trims everything after the bullets section. it prints only the first instance of the bullets.</p>

<p>Please help me doing this. Is there a way of storing multiple sections in a list and then finally converting the complete list to PDF?</p>

For example if the query is run and there are 16000 results it will break this down into 2000 results per CSV file that the user can download, so there would be 8 download buttons. When the user press the download button it creates a CSV file.</p>

<p>I currently use this in coldfusion to generate the CSV</p>

<pre><code>&lt;cflock name=""SFSchoolList"" timeout=""20"" type=""exclusive""&gt;
   &lt;cfheader name=""Content-Disposition"" value=""attachment; filename=UserList.csv""&gt;
   &lt;cfcontent type=""application/vnd.ms-excel""&gt;

<p>This will loop through the SF query to create the CSV when the user clicks the download button from the from. </p>

<p>My question is, how do I go about rewriting this to have it query those results automatically when they press the generate button, when pressed it will write all the possible files to a folder on our server and zip it allowing the user to press a download all button and download the zip instead of individually clicking every download button? </p>

<pre><code>1) Download and install the Eclipse IDE (http://www.eclipse.org/), the Android SDK, ADT plugin for Eclipse, and the Android NDK (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
a) For Windows use, also download and install Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/). During Cygwin setup, make sure to include the “Devel -&gt; make” package.
2) Download the Foxit embedded SDK Package.
3) Extract the Foxit embedded SDK Package to any directory.
4) Place the Foxit embedded SDK library and header files in fpdfemb_android/examples/demos/bin and include directory.
5) Build the NDK layer.
a) Open the Android.mk makefile in fpdfemb_android/examples/demos/demo(like “demo_view”)/jni/ in a text editor and fill in the Foxit library name in the area designated for LOCAL_LDLIBS, dropping the lib prefix:
The demo is shipped as:
LOCAL_LDLIBS +=../bin/# fill in library name here
To add downloaded libfoxit.a from step 2, fill in as:
LOCAL_LDLIBS :=../bin/libfoxit.a
If the library provide is not named “libfoxit.a” please adjust accordingly.
b) Open Cygwin (Windows), or a terminal (Linux based), and navigate to the fpdfemb_android/examples/demos/demo(like “demo_view”) directory. Run “ndk-build –B” to build the NDK/JNI layer.
Example:
me@myStation /myProjectPath/ &gt; ndk-build –B
This assumes that the ndk directory is part of the $PATH environment variable. The command can also be qualified with the path to the NDK directory.
</code></pre>

<p>But then I'm getting this error in the terminal:</p>

<p>Android NDK: WARNING:jni/Android.mk:fpdfembedsdk: non-system libraries in linker flags: jni/../../bin/libfoxit.a<br>
Android NDK:     This is likely to result in incorrect builds. Try using LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES<br>

But, as you know, the long-polling connection can not be stay connected all the time. Every time a new message comes or reaches the timeout, it will break and then connect to the server again. If a message is sent before the connection re-connected, it is a problem to keep the integrity of chat.</p>

<p>And also, if a user opens more than one window with Comet-chat, all the chat messages have to keep sync, which means a user can have lots of long-polling connections. So it is hard to keep every message delivered on time.</p>

<p>Should I build a message queue for every connection? Or what else better way to solve this?</p>

"14983612","1","15005399","","2013-02-20 15:27:38","","0","483","<p>Let's pretend that I have an interface called <code>IValidator</code> that looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IValidator {
    /**
     * Returns true if the specified strings are valid.
     */
    public boolean validate(List&lt;String&gt; someStrings);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's say that I have two implementations of <code>IValidator</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class StrictValidator implements IValidator {
    public boolean validate(List&lt;String&gt; someStrings) {
        //some strict validation code
        return false;
    }
}

public class LaissezFaireValidator implements IValidator {
    public boolean validate(List&lt;String&gt; someStrings) {
        //some easy-going validation code
        return true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's add a servlet that uses an injected instance of <code>IValidator</code>:</p>

<pre><code>@Service
@At(""/rest"")
public class MyServlet extends AbstractServlet {

    private final IValidator validator;

    @Inject
    public MyServlet(final IValidator validator) {
        this.validator = validator;
    }

    @Post
    @At(""/validate"")
    @LaissezFaire
    public Reply&lt;?&gt; validate(Request request) {
        //get the strings to validate out of the request object
        List&lt;String&gt; strings = (List&lt;String&gt;) restUtil.parseRequest(request, List.class);

        //validate the request
        if (!this.validator.validate(strings)) {
            return Reply.saying().status(409);
        } else {
            return Reply.saying().noContent();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course we'll also need to bind <code>IValidator</code> to <code>StrictValidator</code> in a module:</p>

<pre><code>public class ValidatorModule implements Module {
    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        bind(IValiator.class).to(StrictValidator.class);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But what happens if I want to conditionally bind <code>IValidator</code> to <code>StrictValidator</code> in one case, but instead bind it to <code>LaissezFaireValidator</code> in some other case?</p>

<p>Did you notice the <code>@LaissezFaire</code> annotation on <code>MyServlet.validate</code> above? That's an interceptor that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>@BindingAnnotation
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface LaissezFaire { }

public class LaissezFaireInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor {
    private boolean debug;
    private IValidator validator;

    @Inject
    public void setDebug(@Named(""debug.enabled"") boolean debugEnabled) {
        this.debug = debugEnabled;
    }

    @Inject
    public void setValidator(final IValidator validator) {
        this.validator = validator;
    }

    @Override
    public Object invoke(MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable {
        if (debug) {
            if (!this.validator.validate(strings)) {
                return Reply.saying().status(409);
            } else {
                return Reply.saying().noContent();
            }
        } else {
            return invocation.proceed();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And once again we need some bindings to set up the interceptor:</p>

<pre><code>public class InterceptorModule implements Module {
    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        final MethodInterceptor lfInterceptor = new LaissezFaireInterceptor();
        requestInjection(lfInterceptor);
        bindInterceptor(Matchers.subclassesOf(AbstractServlet.class), Matchers.AnnotatedWith(LaissezFaire.class), lfInterceptor);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>According to the <code>ValidatorModule</code>, the <code>LaissezFaireInterceptor</code> class will get an instance of <code>StrictValidator</code> when <code>InterceptorModule</code> calls <code>requestInjection(lfInterceptor);</code>.</p>

<p>Instead, I'd like <code>MyServlet</code> to get an instance of <code>StrictValidator</code> and <code>LaissezFaireInterceptor</code> to get an instance of <code>LaissezFaireValidator</code>.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/BindingAnnotations"" rel=""nofollow"">the Google Guice docs</a>, I could use a named annotation when I request injection. The constructor of <code>MyServlet</code> would be modified to look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>    @Inject
    public MyServlet(@Named(""strict"") final IValidator validator) {
        this.validator = validator;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>and the <code>setValidator</code> method of <code>LaissezFaireInterceptor</code> would be modified to look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>    @Inject
    public void setValidator(@Named(""laissezfaire"") final IValidator validator) {
        this.validator = validator;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>and finally <code>ValidatorModule</code> would be modified to look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>public class ValidatorModule implements Module {
    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        bind(IValiator.class).annotatedWith(Names.named(""strict"")).to(StrictValidator.class);
        bind(IValidator.class).annotatedWith(Names.named(""laissezfaire"")).to(LaissezFaireValidator.class);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is all well and good except that the docs specifically say to avoid this approach because the string names can't be checked by the compiler. In addition, it means that I have to add an <code>@Named</code> annotation to every place in the code that requests an <code>IValidator</code> by injection, or else the binding will fail.</p>

<p>I had really hoped that <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/ProviderBindings"" rel=""nofollow"">Provider Bindings</a> could solve this problem for me, but they don't appear to know anything about the context in which the binding is being made. Since they don't know the type of the class that is requesting the binding, I can't choose which type of <code>IValidator</code> to return from the <code>get()</code> method.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to approach this problem?</p>

<p>The JSON contains questions of different types that correspond to different classes.

I have done my testing against the test site with the test encryption key and all works well. When I switch this over to use the live site with the live encryption key, I get the dreaded <code>3045 : The Currency field is missing</code> error.</p>

<p>The same encryption key works on the live site when using VPS protocol 2.22, but not when it's switched to 3.00.</p>

<p>I have also fed the post data to a decryption script that is using the same key to decrypt the <code>crypt</code> without issue.</p>

<p>Can anyone think of why the code would work against <code>test.</code>, but not <code>live.</code> with the appropriate key, or why 2.22 accepts the key and 3.0 does not? Is <code>live.</code> doing any extra checking with 3.00 that <code>test.</code> isn't?</p>

<p>My code has slightly modified the functions from the integration kit:</p>

<pre><code>function addPKCS5Padding($input) {
  $blockSize = 16;
  $padd = """";

  // Pad input to an even block size boundary.
  $length = $blockSize - (strlen($input) % $blockSize);
  for ($i = 1; $i &lt;= $length; $i++) {
    $padd .= chr($length);
  }

  return $input . $padd;
}

// AES encryption, CBC blocking with PKCS5 padding then HEX encoding.
function sagepay_encrypt($string, $key) {
  // Add PKCS5 padding to the text to be encrypted.
  $string = addPKCS5Padding($string);

  // Perform encryption with PHP's MCRYPT module.
  $crypt = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key, $string, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $key);

  // Perform hex encoding and return.
  return ""@"" . strtoupper(bin2hex($crypt));
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is called by populating the <code>$crypt_values</code> array and calling:</p>

<pre><code>$crypt_source = sagepay_buildcrypt($crypt_values);
$crypt = sagepay_encrypt($crypt_source, $sagepay_key);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>$crypt_source</code> is valid and (largely) the same in all cases:</p>

<p>My appliction uses an SQL database from which it reads my datatables at start of my application. If the application would fail to connect to the SQL DB, I have a local Ms Access .MDB file. I have a separate thread that checks if the local database is outdated.</p>

<p>I have a DataTable which I obtain from my SQL connection --> Verified and working
I can connect to my Access database locally and read from it --> Verified and working</p>

<p><em>Issue/Question</em></p>

<p>I'm trying to update my local database by updating it with the DataTable I obtained from my SQL Connection. </p>

<pre><code>public static void UpdateLocalDatabase(string strTableName, OleDbConnection MyConnection, DataTable MyTable)
{
    try
    {
        if (CreateDatabaseConnection() != null)
        {
            string strQuery = ""SELECT * FROM "" + strTableName;
            OleDbDataAdapter MyAdapter = new OleDbDataAdapter();
            OleDbCommandBuilder MyCommandBuilder = new OleDbCommandBuilder(MyAdapter);
            MyAdapter.SelectCommand = new OleDbCommand(strQuery, odcConnection);
            MyAdapter.UpdateCommand = MyCommandBuilder.GetUpdateCommand();
            MyConn.Open();
            MyAdapter.Update(MyTable);
            MyConn.Close();
        }
    }
    catch { }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I debug this snippet, all variables are what they should be:</p>

<ul>
<li>strTableName = the correct name for my table</li>
<li>MyConn = @""Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=MyLocation;Persist Security Info=True;JET OLEDB:Database Password=MyPassword;""</li>
<li>MyTable = is the correct table that is also used further on by my application</li>
</ul>

<p>This process runs through without an error and without using the catch but it does not touch my database, it just doesn't do a thing.</p>

<p>Am I dropping the ball here or just missing the obvious, I have no idea but I browsed many articles and apart for showing the MyAdapter.Update(), there doesn't seem to be much more to it.</p>

<p>Any help is welcome.</p>

  <p>The target string is prepended to your app's hostname. 
  It is usually the name of a module. 
  The cron job will be routed to the default version of the named module. 
  Note that if the default version of the module changes, 
  the job will run in the new default version.</p>
  
  <p>If there is no module with the name assigend to target, 
  the name is assumed to be an app version, and App Engine will attempt to 
  route the job to that version. See About appengine-web.xml</p>

Unfortunately, this product requires multiple screens to be open (and I'm not going to require our users to use a non-Microsoft internet browser).  Furthermore, we have another product that hosts this Silverlight application inside a WPF WebBrowser control (which is similar to IE - and experiences the same issues as delineated above).  Does anyone have any ideas on how to get around this?  This is becoming increasingly frustrating.  </p>

<p>I should also point out, that the default splash screen seems to avoid these issues.  When I remove the custom splash screen, we no longer see these problems.</p>

<p>ANY help would be appreciated greatly!</p>

So, instead of creating a new question/thread, I decided to redo this one - the title still applies to the question.</p>

<p>I am trying to implement the <a href=""http://malsup.com/jquery/form/"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery Form</a> plugin. My final goal will be to
1) validate the form prior to submission
2) upload the selected file, and
3) send the submitted form data to a processing script and write the file and form data to a database.</p>

<p>My first <strong>three</strong> attempts at doing this using some sort of ajax plug-in have all failed. So I'm starting from a simple ajax form that sends two form fields to a script that is supposed to return a successful run and then display a message saying so. Then once I get that working I'll work my way up to processing the data and then (hopefully) a file upload.</p>

<p>The following code was taken from the jQuery Form plug-in's example code.</p>

<p>Here's the form HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""myForm"" action=""testProcessAjaxUploadForm.php"" method=""post""&gt; 
    Name: &lt;input type=""text"" name=""name"" /&gt; 
    Comment: &lt;textarea name=""comment""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; 
    &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Submit Comment"" /&gt; 
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the jQuery code:</p>

<pre><code>// bind 'myForm' and provide a simple callback function 
$('#myForm').ajaxForm(function() { 
    alert(""Thank you for your comment!""); 
});
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the php code that is <strong>supposed</strong> to process the retrieved form data and return something so the javascript alert displays:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    require_once ('../scripts/logging.php');
    $log = new Logging();

    if (isset($_POST['comment']) &amp;&amp; isset($_POST['name'])) {
        $log-&gt;lwrite('name: ' . $_POST['name'] . ', comment: ' . $_POST['comment']);
    } else {
        $log-&gt;lwrite('Nothing passed to the script.');
    }

    //return true;
    return $_POST['name'];
    //echo $_POST['name'];
</code></pre>

<p>The first logging line does write to the log file, so I know the script is executing. When either return line is used, the browser just loads a blank page with the script file name in the address bar, when echo is used the name is displayed on the page, with the script's file name in the address bar. In any case the javascript Thank You message never shows.</p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>The PHP code works correctly <em>for how I've written it</em>. Meaning it can take the posted form fields and use them. The jQuery Form plug-in example page says about the sample code, ""If the server returns a success status then the user will see a ""Thank you"" message."" So I guess my question is, ""what is the php script supposed to return that will cause the jQuery code to detect a successful response so that the Thank you message displays?</p>

<p>My use case is a pre-existing web app, that uses old-school jQuery and Ajax to show and replace various blocks on the page. This is from before Angular JS times.</p>

<p>Now, we need to develop a somewhat more complex part on this page, for which we want to use Angular JS, because it would otherwise get quite complex to develop the desired functionality. Without changing the app too much, we want to include Angular just for this small part on the page (a form with some complex rules attached: show, hide, loop, etc...)</p>

<p>My questions are these:</p>

<p>1) How to start Angular JS ""on demand""? The page does not have the ""ng-app"", ""ng-controller"" or Angular JS loaded initially. I can add these attributes using jQuery when needed and run some code to start it, but this does not seam to work without the page load event.</p>

<p>2) Angular JS should be started though a HTML fragment which the app will include when needed. This fits the old skool way the app works, so we don't want to change this.</p>

<p>3) The existing app uses Prototype JS and jQuery in no conflict mode. Are special steps needed to prevent conflicts when Angular JS enters the picture?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I have 2 files of A.ascx and B.ascx

I use 'isEqual' variable inside one of the method I typed in.

Thus, Once I used that 'isEqual' inside of these 2 vb (files), I will got the error appeared as from one of the vb file;</p>

<p>The ODBC driver works with kerberos authentication fine in a standalone scenario. That is, it can request and forward on a ticket for the current user just fine. But in my service, I may be dealing with multiple users at once. How do I accept a ticket so that when I connect to the ODBC driver it discovers and uses the correct user's ticket?</p>

The array from the query result is looped through and the image name is extracted, then passed to a variable which also contains the image path. However when the variable is included in the output, a torn image icon is displayed (no image).</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>public function loadImages($item) {
  $type = $item;
  $conn = $this-&gt;create_connection('read');
  $sql = ""SELECT * FROM `items` WHERE catagory='$type'"";     
  $result = $conn-&gt;query($sql)or die(mysql_error());    
  while($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result)) {

     //var_dump($path);
     echo '&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=""../images/thumbs/'.$path.'""/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;';
  }
</code></pre>

<p>When I <code>var_dump</code> <code>$path</code>, it displays the correct file path: <code>string(28) ""../images/thumbs/image1.jpeg""</code>, with a further seven items, so I am not losing data. I can confirm the path is correct, when I echo the full path and image name, the image displays correctly.</p>

<pre><code>echo '&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=""../images/thumbs/image1.jpg""/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>Also I have tried removing the <code>$path</code> variable and applying <code>$row</code> directly:</p>

<pre><code>echo '&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=""../images/thumbs/'.$row['image_path'].'""/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>I thought the problem was with joining the two strings, so I tried replacing the image variable with <code>$full_path</code>, which also did not work:</p>

<pre><code> $full_path = $path . $row['image_path'];
</code></pre>

<p><code>$row</code> is correct because when I do a <code>var-dump</code> for <code>$row['image_path']</code> I get the following: </p>

<pre><code>string(11) ""image1.jpeg"" string(11) ""image2.jpeg"" string(11) .....
</code></pre>

<p>I previously had the full image path held within the database, when the full image path was used, the images displayed correctly.  I later decided only to store the image name in the database, as the path could change in the future, so the design change created this problem.</p>

<pre><code>[[self navigationController] setNavigationBarHidden:YES];

<p>in <code>viewDidLoad</code> and <code>viewWillAppear:</code> (in <code>viewWillAppear</code> I have it set with animated:YES, so it slides off when coming back from other screens).</p>

<p>When I go to Screen2, I have:</p>

<pre><code>[[self navigationController] setNavigationBarHidden:NO animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>in the first view controller's <code>viewWillDisappear</code>, and the navigation bar slides in all nicely when that view comes on to the top of the navigation stack. </p>

<p>Problem is, when I tap back, the navigation bar animates off the right side of the screen, but Screen2 stays there, revealing another navigation bar underneath!</p>

<p>I can then tap back again and it will push Screen2 off and the main screen shall return, but this is not behaviour I want to pass on to any users, obviously!</p>

<p>Anyone had this issue before, or have any points on what might be the culprit?</p>

<p>Edit: I just found an error appearing when I run the iOS Simulator:</p>

<p>This happens when I click the button to go the the second view (LessonViewController).
Hopefully that might be the thing to crack this, anyone know?</p>

That said, I have a few lookup tables that tie two tables together on their primary keys.  Today, I endeavored to remove an unnecessary primary key we had created in these tables.  After doing so, the table is no longer navigable via Navigation Properties.</p>

<p>So, the best I can do pictorially in text:</p>

<pre><code>---------------          ---------------
|   Table A   |          |   Table B   |
| TableA_ID   |          | TableB_ID   |
| .....       |          | .....       |
---------------          ---------------

              ----------------
              | TableATableB |
              | TableA_ID    |
              | TableB_ID    |
              ----------------
</code></pre>

<p>The expected behavior happens when I create an EDMX with this structure (Table B is subsumed into Table A, and the TableATableB type is ""removed"").  However, instead of providing the TableA.TableB navigation, the DomainServiceClass I have doesn't expose this relationship.  I.E. I cannot navigate to the set of Table B belonging to Table A, even though this is completely possible using T4 code generation (Silverlight can't).</p>

<p>How can I go about exposing this relationship either in metadata or the service class itself?</p>

<p>Here is the snippet from the domain service class (generated using the DomainServiceClass template in VS 2012:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class TableA
{

    // ...
    internal sealed class GameMetadata
    {

        // ...

        public int TableA_ID { get; set; }

        public EntityCollection&lt;TableB&gt; TableBs { get; set; }

        // ...
    }
}

<p>My setup:
I've create a custom TinyMCE button with a popup for a WordPress theme that allows the user to select a custom post type post from a dropdown (in this case a ""Customer Review"") and then have its ID inserted into the shortcode. Since the sites that this theme will run on have well over 1,000 reviews, i thought it would be better to json encode the data for the dropdown and then use select2 to search through a list of limited results (paged results) and keep the whole thing from blowing up. All of that is working successfully, except for 2 items:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The json encoded data shows up, but when i enter a search term, the select2 dropdown shows me a list of all reviews with the first selected. It does not find a result, even though the searched text is in the list</p></li>
<li><p>from above, once i enter a search term, select2 shows me all the results instead of just 10, or whatever limit i set.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here is how i'm json encoding the data (in a file called bpl_content.php):</p>

<pre><code>$args       = array('post_type' =&gt; 'customer_reviews', 'posts_per_page' =&gt; -1, 'fields' =&gt; 'ids');
$posts      = get_posts($args);

if( $posts ) :

    $reviews = array();

    foreach( $posts as $post ) : setup_postdata( $post );

        $title  = get_the_title();
        $the_ID = get_the_ID();

        $reviews[] = array (
            'id'    =&gt; $the_ID,
            'text'  =&gt; $title
        );

    endforeach;

endif;

echo json_encode( $reviews )
</code></pre>

<p>which returns</p>

<pre><code>[{""id"":12286,""text"":""John Doe""},{""id"":12285,""text"":""Jane Doe""},...]
</code></pre>

<p>(There are over 800 items returned, so the above just shows 2, but you get the idea)</p>

<p>Here is the javascript i'm using to get my &lt;select&gt; menu populated with the json data:</p>

<pre><code>$("".js-data-example-ajax"").select2({
    placeholder: ""Select a Review"",
    ajax: {
        url: ""_bpl_content/bpl_content.php"",
        type: 'POST',
        params: {
            contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
        },
        dataType: 'json',
        delay: 250,
        data: function (term, page) {
            return JSON.stringify({ q: term, page_limit: 10 });
        },
        processResults: function (data) {
            return {
                results: data
            };
        },
        cache: true
    },
    minimumInputLength: 3
});
</code></pre>

<p>I can't for the life of me figure out why everything is working, except for the search and pagination. Any ideas?</p>

The trick here is I would like to anchor on a value in the first table.  I can make it work with a <code>INSERT INTO</code> / <code>SELECT FROM</code> combo, but it creates a duplicate record.  </p>

<p>Im using mysql 5.x.  Here are the details. The table with missing data is <code>thisweek</code> and the table with valid data is <code>lastweek</code>. Field 1 is <code>MACAddress</code> (which exists and is the anchor) and exists in both tables (for ex. BE:EF:BA:BE:CA:FE), Fields 2-10 in <code>thisweek</code> are blank (''), but there is data in those same fields(Fields2-10) in table <code>lastweek</code>.</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE thisweek
SET thisweek.field2 = lastweek.field2
where thisweek.MACAddress = lastweek.MACAddress and thisweek.filed2 = ''; 
</code></pre>

<p>I know that query isn't anywhere close, so looking for help.  Again, the same <code>MACAddress</code> exists in both tables, with the only difference between tables being that field2 in <code>thisweek</code> is blank (and it shouldn't be) and needs to be equal to <code>lastweek.field2</code> for that <code>MACAddress</code>.</p>

<p>To manage, for example, a website-wide logo and its text elements with SDL Tridion, I'd want it in a component, rendered by a (dynamic) component template, and placed by page templates. My requirements would include:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Logo as a Component</strong>--image as a multimedia (mm) component and link, alt (i.e. ""home""), and other text in an optional <em>container component</em></li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Component Presentation (DCP)</strong>--ability to manage logo's markup presentation and publish changes <em>without requiring publishing every page</em></li>
<li><strong>Share-able</strong>--ability to localize multimedia and text in components, rather than templates, in lower publications</li>
</ol>

<p>Authors shouldn't need to place the logo as a component presentation (CP) on every page, although a logo CP just on the homepage could offer dynamic linking.</p>

<h2><code>RenderComponentPresentation()</code>, <code>TCDL</code>, or <code>Tridion</code> tags for ""Non CPs""</h2>

<p><strong>For this CP-less approach, I think RenderComponentPresentation() or <a href=""http://sdllivecontent.sdl.com/LiveContent/content/en-US/SDL_Tridion_2011_SPONE/concept_B72F4D64713F4682B61C838A013DF8F8"" rel=""nofollow"">TCDL tag</a> would be the right ""agnostic"" approach. Is one preferred over the other?</strong></p>

<p>For example, my template outputs:</p>



<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;h3&gt;By tridion: (ASP.NET) tag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;tridion:ComponentPresentation runat=""server""
    PageURI=""tcm:7-1535-64""
    ComponentURI=""tcm:7-1533""
    TemplateURI=""tcm:7-1532-32""/&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;By tcdl: tag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;tcdl:ComponentPresentation
    PageURI=""@@Page.ID@@""
    type=""Dynamic""
    ComponentURI=""tcm:7-1533""
    TemplateURI=""tcm:7-1532-32""/&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;by render component presentation&lt;/h3&gt;
@@RenderComponentPresentation('tcm:7-1533','tcm:7-1532-32')@@
</code></pre>

<p>These get transformed to the following on the file system.</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;h3&gt;By tridion: (ASP.NET) tag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;tridion:ComponentPresentation runat=""server""
    PageURI=""tcm:7-1535-64""
    ComponentURI=""tcm:7-1533""
    TemplateURI=""tcm:7-1532-32""/&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;By tcdl: tag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;tridion:ComponentPresentation runat=""server""
    PageURI=""tcm:7-1535-64""
    ComponentURI=""tcm:7-1533""
    TemplateURI=""tcm:7-1532-32""/&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;by render component presentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;tridion:ComponentPresentation runat=""server""

<p>Each <em>renders</em> delivery-side so the user sees the correct CP in the browser.</p>

<h2>Question(s):</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Any approach gets us a DCP referenced from a PT with an agnostic format that gets retrieved presentation-side, avoiding full-site publishing. It's not really <em>on</em> the page so we have to be sure to publish the logo with a dynamic CT (it's html fragment in this case). <strong><em>Am I missing anything?</em></strong> </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is RenderComponentPresentation() preferred over TCDL or a specific presentation-side syntax?</strong> Any reason I'd actually want <code>&lt;tridion:ComponentPresentation runat=""server""&gt;</code> instead?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Edit: I was missing the <code>Type=""Dynamic""</code> attribute and value, also for a moment thought RenderComponentPresentation didn't create the right CP reference.</p>

Just push it out and we'll issue a patch to customers who experience issues!). </p>

<pre><code>/var/www/magento/app/design/frontend/[design_package]/[layout_name]/{layout,templates}
</code></pre>

<p>What does it take for a module defined by a set of files
stored in such a directory to show up on the Magento modules list
at the admnistrative page I just pointed out?</p></li>
<li><p>Under a design package's skin directory, what is the purpose
of having an images directory and then a separate images/media
directory. How does one decide what images to put directly
under the images directory as opposed to under images/media ?
What is the convention used here?</p></li>

<p>I was trying to select data from a table but get this error message!!</p>

<p><strong>mysql_fetch_array() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in select</strong> </p>

<p>I was actually using pagination in php ... but it worked fine for simpler queries with only a single condition in WHERE ... but here ... with multiple conditions it's not working
The full code is :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    /*
        Place code to connect to your DB here.

$con=mysql_connect(""localhost"",""root"",""password"");

}
mysql_select_db(""database"",$con);

    $tbl_name=""posts"";      //your table name
    // How many adjacent pages should be shown on each side?
    $adjacents = 3;

    $query = htmlspecialchars($query);

       If you have a WHERE clause in your query, make sure you mirror it here.
    */
    $query = ""SELECT COUNT(*) as num FROM posts WHERE status='active' AND ((title LIKE '%"".$query.""%') OR (content LIKE '%"".$query.""%'))"";
    $total_pages = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query($query));
    $total_pages = $total_pages['num'];

    /* Setup vars for query. */
    $targetpage = ""index.php"";  //your file name  (the name of this file)
    $limit = 20;                    //how many items to show per page
    /*if($_GET['page']="""")
    {
        $page=2;
    }

    }*/

    $page=1;
    }
    else
    {
    $page = $_GET['page'];
    }

    else
        $start = 0;                             //if no page var is given, set start to 0

</code></pre>

<p>I am able to get most of the output but my output is wrong for two condition:
1. Couldn't get a way to sum up the ArticleName if ArticleName and ArticleDate are same. 
For eg this script gives output for row Ra:
    Ra  20130601    1   1
    Ra  20130601    3   3
    Ra  20130602    1   1
So at the end Ra should print 1+3+1=5 as final total monthly count instead of 1.</p>

<ol>
<li>Since I display in the 3rd if condition all the articles which are not equal to last article I get the value of an article with same article name and date twice. Like: <code>Ra  20130601    1   1</code> should not have been printed.
Does anybody know how to correct this?
Let me know if you need any more information. </li>

The C++ library needs to call back the .NET delegate written in C++/CLI. I'm assigning a call back function to the C++ library classes using Marshal::GetFunctionPointerForDelegate. When this function is called back from the unmanaged side, however, I need to make sure that the .NET delegate function is still in the same memory location.</p>

<p>The easiest way, of course, is to require the .NET library user to pin the .NET object but that's not really a clean design and also allows the user to shoot themselves in the foot. Better way is to design the .NET class so that it pins itself either at the time of creation or triggered by a function/event.</p>

<p>How would I design this? According to this link, <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/18xa23yk%28v=VS.100%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/18xa23yk%28v=VS.100%29.aspx</a>, you can't have interior ~= pinned pointers as object members. This, then, implies that one could create a pinned pointer reference as either a static or a global variable.</p>

<p>Actual efect:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/KxEGr.jpg"" alt=""You can see the problem on the last div""></p>

<p>What I want:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/339me.jpg"" alt=""As you can see all child divs are align and not over flowing outside the current content div...""></p>

<p>So how can get that effect for the child div's to align depending on the position of the parent div...</p>

<h2>Thank you.</h2>

<p>I should have explained this at the beginning sorry...
I have a foreach before i dump the data..
and I have a single block that repeat it self using the foreach with array data</p>

<p>so what I did was to add a counter
The following is not the actual code but to give you an idea...</p>

<pre><code>$sc = 1;
foreach ( -ARRAY- ) {
&lt;!-- div's to display my template --&gt;
&lt;div&gt; Data &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- End data dump with template --&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So what I did was to add an if with the counter so i can get a different class</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- div's to display my template --&gt;
&lt;div &lt;?php if($sc=4){echo 'class=""cols_'.$sc; $sc=1;}else {echo 'cols_'.$sc; $sc++ ?&gt;&gt; Data &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- End data dump with template --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>that way i get cols_1, cols_2, cols_3, now that I have this classes I can style each one as I like and positioning them anywhere I want...
Since I only need 3 classes I think this is the best way to do it, it might not be the best way, but it works for me...</p>

<p>When I benchmarked this it took about 5 seconds, which isn't <em>too</em> bad, but imagine if I was doing this 93 more times.  I understand it won't be instant, but I'd like to shoot for under 30 seconds.  I know it's possible because I've seen websites which do something similar and they act within a 30 second time period.</p>

<p>I've read about using caching the data but that won't work because, simply, it will be old.  I'm using a database (further on, I haven't gotten to that part yet) to store old data and retrieve new data which will be real time (what you see below).</p>

<p>Is there a way to achieve doing something like this without massive delays (and possibly overloading the server I am reading from)?</p>

<p>So in my <code>settings.py</code> I have loaded <code>django.contrib.staticfiles</code> to my <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> and <code>django.core.context_processors.static</code> to my <code>TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS</code>.</p>

<p>I noticed in the admin templates that it links to static files like this (from <code>index.html</code>):</p>

<pre><code>{% load i18n admin_static %}

{% block extrastyle %}{{ block.super }}&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""{% static ""admin/css/dashboard.css"" %}"" /&gt;{% endblock %}
</code></pre>

<p>But looking at the template tag <code>admin_static</code>, it's simply a wrapper for <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#static"" rel=""nofollow""><code>static</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>from django.conf import settings
from django.template import Library

register = Library()

if 'django.contrib.staticfiles' in settings.INSTALLED_APPS:
    from django.contrib.staticfiles.templatetags.staticfiles import static
else:
    from django.templatetags.static import static

static = register.simple_tag(static)
</code></pre>

<p>So I concluded that because every admin static file is serverd with a <code>admin/...</code> prefix, then the full path (for my case) should be</p>

<pre><code>/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/static
</code></pre>

<p>So I set that path to my <code>STATICFILES_DIRS</code> inside <code>settings.py</code>, but Apache still won't serve any static files (after restating the server). Where did I make a mistake in my logic?</p>

I may use image captures and computer vision, but this adds a layer of complexity concerning the interacted elements on the screen.
I was wondering if there is a way to get the actual DOM or HTML elements a user interacts with (mouse click, on focus, kb input, etc) directly from the browser. 
In windows, I may be able to hook a DLL into the browser, but in Linux I have no idea how to do something similar. The idea behind this is that when user clicks on ""Button"" LOG IN, instead of capturing image pixels using CV, I actually get the data structure of the element the user interacted with. How may I do something like this ? The engine will be a service developed in C/C++.</p>

My powershell script creates a directory, copies the model and input files into the directory, and calls the model, which writes a single output file. Once the model is finished,  the script iterates one more time through the loop and does everything again (I have included the script below). My problem is that the memory usage of powershell continually rises, until all the RAM is occupied. Calling the model directly (i.e. simply clicking on the .exe file) produces no such issues, it uses very little memory. What unnecessary information is powershell remembering and how can I force it to keep the memory clear? I'm new to Powershell, so very simple answers, with basically no assumed prior knowledge would be greatly appreciated!

<p>The scaling strategy for the existing application has been to separate read-only and read/write activity. Multiple slave databases are used for searching and writes are done to a master, which update the slaves using MS SQL Server replication.</p>

<p>Since read activity is more common than write, this has proved to be a cheap way to do database load balancing, without true clustering.</p>

<p>The fact is: the double pointer '_t1' is being allocated and filled from the function 'readfile(...)'. This is OK since the simple 'print' shows that the values have been properly read from the file.
Now, the array '_t2' is allocated inside the class A constructor; when I start filling _t2 from _t1, it appears that the values in array _t1 have changed, and I don't figure out why! 
After calling the function readfile(...), nothing else is performed on array the _t1, but when I print its value during assignment of _t2, they are no more the same as the first print. I've been thinking the array _t1 has been passed correctly to the function readfile(...) by reference, may I'm missing something! May Someone find something!!!</p>

<p>We're getting ready to build an app that will need to be able to display large numbers of simple objects in three dimensions.  Say, a couple thousand wireframe boxes, and allow us to pan, rotate and zoom easily and smoothly.  We're primarily a java shop, so a java solution would probably be preferred over other technologies, just because that's what we're strong in.</p>

<p>We want drag&amp;drop and object resizing with the mouse.  We also want to re-position the boxes or other objects based on event feeds from an external application.  So, we might want to re-position hundreds of the boxes a few times a second.</p>

<p>What technologies can actually get this done?</p>

<p>Our legacy app does this with Java 3D, but we'd like to consider what's suitable for the next generation version.</p>

<p>We like something that's a littler higher-level than Java3d.</p>

So I checked the git history for this extension but cannot find a line containing this number. The last line containing a version number close to the latest stable contains version 2.6.3.

<p>I am very new to this, I didn't know what JSON was yesterday, so I apologize if this is a stupid question. A client has requested an JSON/XML type scheme to store data because they want a flat file to edit/update without having to deal with queries, and they want it flexible for future development.  I would like the data to be structured, as I'll use it and php to build html pages, two parts of the site will use it, both on the same server. </p>

<p>The json file will contain an array of objects, probably eventually 50, that consist of  5 or 6 short tag/data combos, and 1-3 tag/data combos that will be long, a couple paragraphs of text each. </p>

<p>Details: server side implementation only, everything will reside on the same server. At this time, I will manually build the json file, in the future it may be automatically generated. I prefer json to xml as it seems to be easier to manipulate with php. I have php 5.2.6 and json 1.2.1.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it appropriate to use json for data that's textarea size? Will it cause performance issues at build-out when I have 30-50 objects in my array, and I need to find the right one?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it appropriate to use json as a data repository like this? </p></li>
<li><p>If so, I'm having trouble finding instructions on the very basics, like how to access the file. Do I have to use XMLHttpRequest even on the same server? Any informational links to help better understand this would be greatly appreciated. </p></li>
<li><p>If this is not a good usage, any tips on what might be a good choice would be greatly appreciated!</p></li>
</ol>

  [self presentModalViewController:secondScreen animated:YES];

<p>Now I have saved one BOOL value stored in settings and I read it and do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if(proceed == NO){}
else {
 secondScreen = [[SecondScreenController alloc] initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil];
      secondScreen.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal;
      [self presentModalViewController:secondScreen animated:YES];
      [secondScreen release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>When it's YES, else code block is entered and there is no error. But my second screen is not displaying, it's first again. Code goes fine but nothing happens. What am I miss now :(</p>

<p>This is header of the first screen, and implementation:</p>

<pre><code>@interface FirstScreenViewController : UIViewController {
 IBOutlet UITextField *txtUsername;
 IBOutlet UITextField *txtPassword;
 IBOutlet UISwitch *chkRememberMe;

 SecondScreenController *secondScreen;
}
@property (nonatomic, retain) UITextField *txtUsername;
@property (nonatomic, retain) UITextField *txtPassword;
@property (nonatomic, retain) SecondScreenController *secondScreen;
@property (nonatomic, retain) UISwitch *chkRememberMe;

<p>This is when I click on login button to pass to secon screen:</p>

<pre><code>if([txtUsername.text isEqualToString: @""test""] &amp;&amp; [txtPassword.text isEqualToString: @""test""])
 {
  if(chkRememberMe.on)
  {

  }
  else

  secondScreen = [[SecondScreenController alloc] initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil];
  secondScreen.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal;
  [self presentModalViewController:secondScreen animated:YES];
  [secondScreen release];
 }
</code></pre>

<p>And in view did load application check if ""REMEMBER ME"" is true is user default settings, and should go to second screen, but breakpoint in debug pass without problems but there is no second screen it's first again:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];

  secondScreen = [[SecondScreenController alloc] initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil];
  secondScreen.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal;
  [self presentModalViewController:secondScreen animated:YES];
  [secondScreen release];

I've attempted to write an application that works using angular.js and Twitter Bootstrap, yet I am creating all of my elements via JavaScript, not hard-coding them into HTML (I hate writing HTML). So far, everything appears to be working fine, except that Bootstrap will not recognize a class list that I've attached to a table element via JavaScript. Here's a quick snippet example:</p>

<pre><code>var myTbl = document.createElement('table');
myTbl.setAttribute('class', 'table table-hover table-striped table-bordered table-condensed');
</code></pre>

<p>The table is created just fine and the class is viewable as an atrribute in the debugger, yet the styles associated to this class list are not being applied to the table via Bootstrap.
I've tried including Bootstrap before I called the function which builds this table as well as I've tried including Bootstrap after I build this table, and this did not make any difference. I am also including angular.min.js after constructing this table and after including Bootstrap. I've also written the same application in HTML, associated an ID to the table with the class, and later pulled that table into a JavaScript variable to investigate it within the debugger, and it is exactly identical to the JavaScript generated table, yet the hard-coded HTML table has the style effects of the class list and the JavaScript generated one does not. If anyone can help me out, it would be greatly, greatly appreciated. </p>

The web part also has some configuration fields (ones you edit by clicking on Modify Shared Web Part).</p>

<p>When I make changes to these fields and try to apply them, the validation of the user field kicks in and prevents the update, even though I am not submitting the form.  I am only trying to submit the settings.  The web part may be used in a few places on our farm, so site collection administrators need to be able to change the settings - at the moment it is not friendly enough for these users to do so.</p>

<p>Here is where I validate the user field:</p>

<pre><code>// Validate form field - required field, and max length is 100 characters.
InputFormRequiredFieldValidator messageRequiredValidator = new InputFormRequiredFieldValidator();
messageRequiredValidator.ControlToValidate = txtMessage.ID;
messageRequiredValidator.ErrorMessage = ""You must write a message to send!"";
messageRequiredValidator.Display = ValidatorDisplay.Dynamic;
messageRequiredValidator.Text = ""&lt;img src=\""/_layouts/images/CNSCA16.gif\""/&gt; You must write a message to send."";
tc.Controls.Add(messageRequiredValidator);
</code></pre>

<p>Here is where I define one of the configuration fields:</p>

<pre><code>private string recipientEmailAddress = ""sender@domain.tld"";
    [WebBrowsable(true),
    Personalizable(true),
    WebPartStorage(Storage.Shared),
    WebDescription(""Email address the form should be sent to""),

    public string RecipientEmailAddress
    {
        get { return recipientEmailAddress; }
        set { recipientEmailAddress = value; }
    }

<p>If a given controller, model or language file exists in the theme, use that, if not, use the core file.</p>

<p>I'm currently autoloading all the system files which works great. But I'm wondering if it would be better to also autoload all my controller, model, and language files as well?</p>

<p>I've noticed that (even in OpenCart) the same file gets searched via the file system, and loaded multiple times. (models and languages in particular)</p>

<p>Would it not be more efficient to autoload all these files then simply instantiate the exiting class, over searching for the files each time then using an include?</p>

<p>Let me give an example ... </p>

<p>My homepage contains the following modules:</p>

<p>Slideshow, 
Latest Products, 
Featured Products, 
Carousel</p>

<p>This along with the header and footer controllers ends up calling:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;load-&gt;model('catalog/product');
</code></pre>

<p>23 times.</p>

<p>That's 23 times that the same exact file is being searched for using the file system.  Plus of course all the other models being called.</p>

<p>So I guess the question is really more about overhead ... </p>

<p>Is it more expensive to autoload (and cache) all files regardless of whether they're being called, or search the file system and do includes for each file as it's needed?</p>

<p>I'm sure this is an age old question but I've yet to see a definitive answer.</p>

<p>And BTW either answer is fine, I'd just like to be as efficient as possible in my code.</p>

I simply cannot make an initial commit now that the repository is there. When I use VCS -> Git -> Commit file, it simply pops up a window that says ""Nothing to commit."". I've tried making a new dummy file, and yet it still thinks there have been no changes. I've also tried selecting all of the files and using the ""add"" button, but this appears to do nothing whatsoever. How can I get this project on GitHub? My desire, specifically, is literally just to somehow commit my project in Android Studio into this GitHub repository it has created for me so that I can collaborate on this project with some friends. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>I am currently looking into user authentication methods for learning disabled users with special educational needs. Users will be logging into a mobile app and require authentication due to sensitive family issues.</strong></p>

<p>Are there known best practises for this demographic of user? It is very difficult to find anything online in relation to this. I have seen a lot of content for visually and hearing imnpaired users but it is not what I am looking for. </p>

<p>Assumptions I DO NOT wish to make:
Users already have Facebook or other social media accounts.
Users regularly access an email account.
Users can remember passwords with existing best practise criteria e.g. at least one capital letter, one number and one character that is neither a letter or a number.
Users will be able to cope with the conventional 'forgot password' process while on the move of accessing their email</p>

<p>Has anyone dealt in this area before? Any ideas or links to blogs, articles or scientific papers would be great. Any past experienced would also be welcomed. </p>

<p>I have come across this site <a href=""http://disabilitynetwork.org/technology/40-amazing-ipad-apps-for-the-learning-disabled/#.U4R9VfldX6I"" rel=""nofollow"">http://disabilitynetwork.org/technology/40-amazing-ipad-apps-for-the-learning-disabled/#.U4R9VfldX6I</a></p>

<p>However, like other search results, it focusses on apps that serve specific disabilities rather than with the specific issues of login for a wide spread of users.</p>

<p>I want to install as little as possible, as long as I can do the above things I am more than satisfied.</p>

<p>Especially since I have problems with the complete Web Tools Platform (WTP); according to <em>me</em> it's full of bugs related to validation. It sometimes says valid files are invalid, often it helps if you simply restart Eclipse. I have also found it to ignore exclusions as well as sometimes completely ignoring that I have disabled validation all together.</p>

<p>The problems I've experienced have made me uninterested in anything from the WTP project, <em>except</em> the plug ins enabling me to work more smoothly by fulfilling the above unordered list (because that part of WTP worked really well).</p>

<p>I have heard the some have had success with <a href=""http://www.eclipsetotale.com/tomcatPlugin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Sysdeo Eclipse Tomcat Launcher Plug-in</a> together with Ganymede. But since it's officially not supported and there has not been a new release since May 2007 and running it with Ganymede involved changing the plug-in files to accept versions >=3.4 I don't see it as a long term solution.</p>

<p>Installing <strong>parts</strong> of the <strong>WTP</strong> but <strong>not it in its whole</strong> feels like a long term solution while at the same time skipping the error ridden parts of the WTP. But I need help with which parts I need to install, as the documentation on Eclipse.org does not explain. Of course, if there is another supported solution than using parts of WTP then that is of interest too!</p>

<p>I need form data to be posted in UTF-8 even if containing page uses ISO-8859-1 charset. I found a solution for FF, but not for IE.
Here is the whole story:</p>

<p>I use Jersey REST web service to receive data posted from simple html &lt;FORM&gt;.
When the page uses UTF-8 charset, posted data is also encoded using UTF-8 and everything works fine.
But when the page uses ISO-8859-1 charset, FORM data is also posted using ISO-8859-1 and Jersey has trouble with special characters (probably because it expects data to come in UTF-8).</p>

<p>Jersey method looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Path(""/someMethod"")
@POST
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_HTML)
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)
public String someMethod(@FormParam(""someParam"") String someParam)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course if I change the whole page encoding to UTF-8, everything works fine, the problem is that I add form dynamically to existing pages that may use different encoding (in other works I can't tamper with page encoding).</p>

<p>I have solution that works for FF but not for IE. If I add <code>accept-charset=""utf-8""</code> attribute to FORM that posts the data, FF correctly encodes all posted data using utf-8 regardless of containing page encoding, but this doesn't work in IE.</p>

<p>Any ideas?
Thank you!</p>

Using self signed certs, this works fine. However, things get tricky when Websockets come into play.</p>

<p>Running the whole thing in IE 10 works fine. The client authenticates with his certificate and gains access to the site and may open the Websocket. FF and Chrome, however, won't work. Note that webserver and websocket run on the same port.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it seems that IE somehow stores the authentication of the client and uses it as well for the access to the websocket. FF and Chrome somehow treat the websocket as a different ressource for which no authentication has happened before.</p>

<p>I have already spent several hours on Google trying to find some guidance on how to do that. I found some clues such as the 301 redirect, rewrite... but I am not being able to apply any solution to my Beanstalk EC2 instance.</p>

<p>Perhaps I need a more detailed explanation on how to do that.
Could someone help me, please?</p>

<p>PS: one thing that I am struggling to understand is the fact that the Load Balancer says that Load Balancer Port 80 is pointing to Instance Port 80 and Load Balancer Port 443 (HTTPS) is also pointing to Instance Port 80, but with Cipher/SSL cert.
Well, when I examine the nginx configuration files on my EC2 instance I only find a ""server { listen 8080"", not ""listen 80"".</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks azhrei, you said: "" I think what you're trying to say is X1 will not be able to catch Y1, even though X1 is a predator watching the prey Y1, because Y1 is intelligent."", yes it is!!</p>

<p>I found that prolog has some strong constrains[1]:</p>

<ol>
<li>Prolog doesn't allow ""or""d (disjunctive) facts or conclusions.</li>
<li>Prolog doesn't allow ""not"" (negative) facts or conclusions.</li>
<li>Prolog doesn't allow most facts or conclusions having existential quantification.</li>
<li>Prolog doesn't directly allow second-order logic.</li>
</ol>

<p>So i changed the code: </p>

<pre><code>%rules
predator(X) :- prey(Y), watch(X,Y).
catch(X,Y) :- predator(X),prey(Y),not(intelligent(Y)),watch(X,Y).
hungry(X) :- predator(X),prey(Y),watch(X,Y),not(catch(X,Y)).

%facts
prey(pelusa).
intelligent(shaki).
intelligent(pelusa).
watch(shaki,pelusa).
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried using:</p>

<pre><code> false :- predator(X),prey(Y),intelligent(Y),watch(X,Y),catch(X,Y).
</code></pre>

<p>And it compiles, but when prolog needs to find if catch(X,Y) is true it can´t because the predicate isn´t in a rule consequent. </p>

<pre><code>class Loser

  def initialize (fingers)
    @fingers = fingers
  end

  def fingerprint
    return @fingers
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>So lets say I want to make 10 losers. The first loser has 1 finger, the second loser has 2 fingers... etc. </p>

<p>Rather than going through</p>

<pre><code>loser1 = Loser.new(1)
loser2 = Loser.new(2)
etc,
</code></pre>

<p>I thought I could do something like </p>

<pre><code>array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
array.each {|i| loser#{i} = Loser.new(i)}
</code></pre>

<p>I want </p>

<pre><code>puts Loser5.fingerprint 
</code></pre>

<p>to output 5 which totally doesn't work. Any suggestions please. This may be very simple. I am new.</p>

<p>And have attempted to test it via the following PHPUnit test:</p>

<pre><code>class FooTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
    public function testInstance()
    {

        $bar = $this-&gt;getMock('Bar');
        $foo = $this-&gt;getMock('Foo', array('getBarInstance'));
        $foo-&gt;expects($this-&gt;any())
            -&gt;method('getBarInstance')
            -&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue($bar));

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>However this doesn't work - the constructor of Foo() is called before my ->expects() is added, so the mocked getBarInstance() method returns a null.</p>

<p>Is there any way of unlinking this dependency without having to refactor the way the class uses constructors?</p>

"18249338","1","18252438","","2013-08-15 08:55:04","","6","266","<p>I have a Haskell program that generates ~280M of logging text data during a run inside the ST monad. This is where virtually all memory consumption goes (with logging disabled the program allocates a grand total of 3MB real memory).</p>

<p>Problem is, I run out of memory. While the program runs memory consumption exceeds 1.5GB, and it finally runs out when it tries to write the log string to a file.</p>

<p>The log function takes a String and accumulates the log data into a string builder stored in an STRef in the environment:</p>

<pre><code>import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Builder as BB
...
myLogFunction s = do
    ...
    lift $ modifySTRef myStringBuilderRef (&lt;&gt; BB.stringUtf8 s)
</code></pre>

<p>I tried introducing strictness using bang patterns and modifySTRef', but this made memory consumption even worse.</p>

<p>I write the log string as recommended by the hPutBuilder documentation, like this:</p>

<pre><code>    hSetBinaryMode h True
    hSetBuffering  h $ BlockBuffering Nothing
    BB.hPutBuilder h trace
</code></pre>

<p>This consumes several additional GBs of memory. I tried different buffering settings and converting to a lazy ByteString first (slightly better).</p>

<p>Qs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How can I minimize memory consumption while the program runs? I'd expect given a tight ByteString representation and the appropriate amount of strictness I'd need little more memory than the ~280M of actual log data I'm storing.</p></li>
<li><p>How can I write the result to a file without allocating memory? I don't understand why Haskell needs GBs of memory to just stream some resident data into a file.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Here's the memory profile for a small run (~42MB of log data). The total memory use is 3MB with logging disabled.</p>

<pre><code>    15,632,058,700 bytes allocated in the heap

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I ran a memory profile with a small log run as asked:</p>

<p><img src=""http://imageshack.us/a/img14/9778/6a5o.png"" alt=""profile""></p>

<p>I tried adding bang patterns, $!, deepseq/$!!, force and such in the relevant places, but it doesn't seem to make any difference. How do I force Haskell to actually take my string / printf expression etc. and put it in a tight ByteString instead of keeping all those [Char] lists and unevaluated thunks around?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Here's the actual full trace function</p>

<pre><code>trace s = do
     enable &lt;- asks envTraceEnable
     when (enable) $ do
        envtrace &lt;- asks envTrace
        let b = B8.pack s
        lift $ b `seq` modifySTRef' envtrace (&lt;&gt; BB.byteString b)
</code></pre>

<p>Is this 'strict' enough? Do I need to watch out for anything if I call this typeclass function inside my ReaderT/ST monad? Just so that it is actually called and not deferred in any way.</p>

<pre><code>do
    trace $ printf ""%i"" myint
</code></pre>

<p>is fine?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>So, my app has_many Folders which belong_to Collections.
Folders are nested, they can also belong_to another Folder.</p>

<p>I want to validate uniqueness of the folder names within each collection. When I create folders at the top level this works, but when I create it in lower levels it does not work. Here are the models:</p>

<pre><code>class Folder &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  # CALLBACKS
  before_create :associate_collection

  # RELATIONSHIPS
  belongs_to :collection
  belongs_to :parent, :class_name =&gt; 'Folder'
  has_many :subfolders, :class_name =&gt; 'Folder', :foreign_key =&gt; :parent_id

  # VALIDATIONS
  validates_presence_of :name
  validates_uniqueness_of :name, :scope =&gt; :collection_id

  private

  def associate_collection
    if self.collection.nil?
    self.collection = self.parent.collection
    end
  end
end

class Collection &lt; ActiveRecord::Base

  # RELATIONSHIPS
  has_one :root_folder, :class_name =&gt; 'Folder', :conditions =&gt; { :parent_id =&gt; nil }
  has_many :folders

  # CALLBACKS
  after_create :setup_root_folder

  private

  def setup_root_folder
    self.create_root_folder(:name=&gt;'Collection Root')
    self.save!
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>Here's an abridged example of what happens in the console:</p>

<pre><code>c = Collection.new(:name=&gt;'ExampleCollection')
#&lt;Collection id: 1&gt;

root = c.root_folder
#&lt;Folder id: 1, collection_id: 1&gt;

f1 = root.subfolders.create(:name=&gt;'Test')
#&lt;Folder id: 2 collection_id: 1&gt; 

f1.valid?
# TRUE

f2 = root.subfolders.create(:name=&gt;'Test')
#&lt;Folder id: 3 collection_id: 1&gt;

f2.valid?
# FALSE

f1.valid?
# FALSE
</code></pre>

<p>So, while the collection is being associated with a subfolder correctly, its not triggering the validations correctly until after it's saved.</p>

<p>Suggestions?</p>

<p>I just have an operating system on my machine and a text editor. And to write my layer I want to see the methods that tcp layer exposes.</p>

<p>And I have exact same question for layers below tcp layer.</p>

<p>Consider a restful architecture for a forum or blog that generates random IDs for each post.  </p>

<p>Simulating creating those topics/articles would be simple, because you'd just be posting form data to an endpoint like: <code>/article</code>, or <code>/topic</code></p>

<p>But how do you then stress test commenting on those articles/topics?  This is different, because the comments need to belong to an article/topic, which means that you need the ids of those items. However, if all you can do is issue posts, and you have no way of pulling those ids, you'd be unable to create them.  </p>

<p>I'm creating a site that is similar in this regard, and I have no idea how to stress test the creation of the comments.  </p>

<p>I have two ideas, and they're both pretty awful:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate a massive system ahead of time with some kind of factory, and then freeze it.  From there, I figure I'd have to use some kind of browser automation to create my 'comments' on all of this.  The automation would I suppose go through a recording proxy, like what JMeter offers.  Then, to run the test, I reload the database, and replay the massive log file.</li>
<li>Use browser automation for the whole thing, taking advantage of the dynamic links delivered in the HTML page.  The only option here would be Selenium, and really, we're talking a massive selenium grid that would be extremely expensive. Probably very difficult to maintain also.</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 2 is completely infeasible near as I can tell, but option 1 sounds excruciating.  I'm really hoping someone can suggest something more clever.</p>

NSURL *URLreq = [NSURL fileWithPath:pathHTML];
NSURLRequest *loadURL = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:URLreq];
[webview loadRequest:loadURL];
</code></pre>

<p>How to create load multiple HTML files for each elements in array ?</p>

<p>NOTE: is it right way of programming by creating 15 nsstring's and load in each switch case in detailVIew???</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Functions can then be attached to objects, to be executed when an
  event is emitted. These functions are called listeners. Inside a
  listener function, this refers to the EventEmitter that the listener
  was attached to.</p>

<p>The thing is, when I play around a little with this I find that it, in my understanding, doesn't follow the doc.</p>

<pre><code>var events = require('events');

function Person(nameInput){
    this.name = nameInput;
    this.sayMyName = function(preString){
        console.log(preString + this.name);

Person.prototype = new events.EventEmitter();

var person1 = new Person(""James"");
var person2 = new Person(""Daniel"");

person1.addListener('sayit', function(){
    this.sayMyName(""Hello "");
});

person2.addListener('sayit', function(){
    this.sayMyName(""Hi "");
});

person1.emit('sayit');
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>//console prints out:
Hello James
Hi James
</code></pre>

<p>My question is. Given the docs saying <code>this refers to the EventEmitter that the listener was attached to</code> (person1 resp. person2 in my case), shouldn't the output of the program be:</p>

<pre><code>Hello James

<p>i was using two library one for getting timezone id from client browser and other one to get date &amp; time based on timezone id. those two libraries are</p>

<p>but the problem is moment.js was giving time based on user pc date time setting. so if user pc date time is wrong then moment.js will return wrong date time. so i was looking for a way like how to get date &amp; time by timezone id following ntp protocol.fortunately i got a solution from this <a href=""http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/getting-the-real-time-in-javascript/"" rel=""nofollow"">url</a> </p>

<h2>their code as follows</h2>

<pre><code>// Get London time, and format it:
getTime('Europe/London', function(time){
    var formatted = time.getHours() + ':' 
                  + time.getMinutes() + ':'
                  + time.getSeconds();
    alert( 'The time in London is ' + formatted );
});

$.getTime = function(zone, success) {
    var url = 'http://json-time.appspot.com/time.json?tz='
            + zone + '&amp;callback=?';
    $.getJSON(url, function(o){
        success &amp;&amp; success(new Date(o.datetime), o);
    });
};
</code></pre>

<p>how far i understand the above code that it will call time.json and pass timezone id and response will back a new date and time based on timezone id.</p>

<p>i have one question that </p>

<pre><code>1) please tell me someone that above js routine will return right date and time based on timezone id?
</code></pre>

<p>2) what about latency is there. suppose i made call to time.json and got the response back after 10 sec may be due to slow internet or any other reason. in this situation how could i get correct date &amp; time.</p>

<p>so guide me what i need to do to always get correct time with date if response back after few sec or minute. <code>also discuss what other best way out there to get NTP date &amp; time using javascript.</code> looking for guidance. </p>

<p><strong>he main issue is latency...if i get response back after few sec or minute then how could i re-calculate time to make it accurate for latency or slow response problem.....please guide me someone</strong>. thanks</p>

<p>I have a <strong>project</strong> table, a <strong>dialogue</strong> table, and a <strong>translation</strong> table. </p>

<p>Each entry in each table has an <em>id</em> column. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>dialogue</strong> has a <code>projectID</code> column that indicates the project the dialogue is a part of. </li>
<li><strong>translation</strong> has a <code>dialogueID</code> column that indicates the dialogue entry being translated.</li>

<p>So to help explain this problem, here's a pseudo-query I've constructed:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *

WHERE (translation.dialogueID refers to dialogue where dialogue.projectID = X)

<p>Basically, I want to fetch all translation entries for project X. Since there's no direct route from project -> translation, I'd have to go through project -> dialogue, then dialogue -> translation. I've opted to just add a <code>projectID</code> to the translation table in the meantime, but it is a little clunky.</p>

From reading the Erl book(s) and applying to previous work with services (and good design patterns in general), I can see the benefits of such an approach.  However, this particular group does not currently have any traditional needs for implementing web services -- there are no external consumers, and no integration with other applications.</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is, are there any advantages to going with web services strictly to stick to SOA, that we couldn't get from just implementing objects that are ""service ready""?</p>

<p>To explain, an example.  Let's say you implement the entity ""Person"" as a service.  You have to implement:
1. Business object/logic
2. Translator to service data structure
3. Translator from service data structure
4. WSDL
5. Service data structure (XML/JSON/etc)
6. Assertions</p>

<p>Now, on the other hand, if you don't go with a service, you only have to implement #1, and make sure the other code accesses it through a loose reference (using dependency injection, or a wrapper, etc).  Then, if it later becomes apparent that a service is needed, you can just have the reference instead point to #2/#3 logic above in a wrapper object (so all caller objects do not need updating), and implement the same amount of objects without a penalty to the amount of development you have to do -- no extra objects or code have to be created as opposed to doing it all up front.</p>

<p>So, if the amount of work that has to be done is the same whether the service is implemented initially or as-needed, and there is no current need for external access through a service, is there any reason to initially implement it as a service just to stick to SOA?</p>

@interface KKYLeftSideDrawerViewController : UIViewController &lt;UITableViewDelegate,UITableViewDataSource,KKYViewControllerDelegate&gt;

<p>Well,the delegate works because when i touch down the <em>case 1 row</em>,my console will Log the info where I put them in the *- (void)handleRefresh:(UIWebView <em>)webView</em>.</p>

<p>There comes the problem:in <em>- (void)handleRefresh</em>,I found that the webview didn't jump and as you can see I tryna log the title of it but resulted null~</p>

<p>I track the log and found the webView I refered in <em>- (void)handleRefresh</em> is nil.I used to think it would be the same webView as above I loaded in *- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated *.</p>

<p>This drives me insane for a long while,just want your help and I'll appreciate it.</p>

Database stores the location, name and gives it an ID (auto_increment).</p>

<p>Okay, so what I'm doing now is allowing people to insert images into posts. Throwing a few ideas around on the best way to do this, as the application I designed allows people to move files around, and I don't want images in posts to break if an image is moved to a different directory (hence the storing of IDs).</p>

<p>What I'm thinking of doing is when linking to images, instead of linking to the file directly, I link it like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""/path/to/functions.php?method=media&amp;id=&lt;IMG_ID_HERE&gt;"" alt="""" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So it takes the ID, searches the database, then from there determines the mime type and what not, then spits out the image.</p>

<p>So really, my question is: Is this the most <em>efficient</em> way?
Note that on a single page there could be from 3 to 30 images, all making a call to this function.</p>

      &lt;workshop1&gt;hello&lt;/workshop1&gt; 
      &lt;url1&gt;www.google.co.uk&lt;/url1&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>I am using a switch case to select a specific workshop where you can change the name and add a URL of the workshop and using this code below will replace the whole document.</p>

<pre><code>public void XMLW()
    {
        XmlTextReader reader = new XmlTextReader(""C:\\myXmFile.xml"");
        XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument(); 

        switch (comboBox1.Text)

        {
            case ""button1"":


                doc.Load(reader); //Assuming reader is your XmlReader 
                doc.SelectSingleNode(""buttons/workshop1"").InnerText = textBox1.Text;
                reader.Close();
                doc.Save(@""C:\myXmFile.xml"");
                break;


        }


    }
</code></pre>

<p>So just to clarify I want my C# program to search through the XML document find the element ""Workshop1"" and replace the innertext with text from a textBox. and be able to save it without replacing the whole document with one node. Thanks for looking. </p>

<p>I have model with array field inside it</p>

<pre><code>Ext.define('MyModel',{
  extend: 'Ext.data.Model',
  fields: [
    { name: 'myfield', type: 'array' }
  ]
})
</code></pre>

<p>that contents data like this</p>

<pre><code>data = Ext.create('MyModel',{
  myfield: [ 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four' ]
})
</code></pre>

<p>I want to extend <code>Ext.form.field.Base</code> to create field that treats this array as todo-list and contains items inside itself ( <code>Ext.form.field.Trigger</code> to add ""todo"" and <code>Ext.ListView</code> to display ""todo's"" ).</p>

<p>I don't know how difficult it is to make <code>Ext.form.field.Base</code> contain items and are there any better possible solutions.</p>

<p>Field must get array on <code>loadRecord()</code> and give it on <code>getRecord()</code> of Form.</p>

<p>Other possible solutions I see:</p>

<p>1) Make Field only with html-template and vanilla-javascript ( bad because why to implement things that are already present in ExtJS )</p>

<p>2) Model relations ( bad because I have to implement 'create, update and delete' for each related model and load them manually )</p>

<p>Thank you for reading, any ideas are welcome!</p>

<p>I would call it a Progress Bar, but unlike what most people call a Progress Bar, it doesn't indicate a computer's progress in a certain processing task, but indicates over a long period of time how far a user has gotten. </p>

<p>I used a simple approach when I only allowed 3 tasks per project. I simple saved separate images of what the bar looked like at each stage. However, with projects having many dozens of tasks, this simply isn't realistic. There must be a better way.</p>

<p>This is what my code looks like (scrubbed for readability, if you need more let me know):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
for($i=0; $i&lt;count($stringArray); $i++) {
    $pieces = explode($GLOBALS['delimiter'], $lineData[$i]);
?&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;

        &lt;input id=""&lt;?php echo $pieces[$someValidNumber]; ?&gt;_identifier"" ...&gt;
        ...
        &lt;script&gt;
            // some javascript with &lt;?php echo $variable; ?&gt;
        &lt;/script&gt;
       ...
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;?php } ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What happens when that loop runs n times, that for n-1 everything looks fine, but in the n-th run, within the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>-section the code suddenly stops. The HTML-File ends properly with all tags closing.</p>

<p>This looks as following (n=4):</p>

<pre><code>$('input[id$=""MegaSteel_tons""]').val(output2);
$('#MegaSteel_cart').prop(
</code></pre>

<p>Or (n=2):</p>

<pre><code>$('input[id$=""BarZwo_meters""]').val(output2);
$('#BarZwo_cart').prop('type', 'button').change
</code></pre>

<p>Note that with an increasing n, the stop does not occur later in a deterministic way. That means when I tried n=3, the below was the result:</p>

<pre><code>$('input[id$=""Bar_meters""]').val(output2);
$('#Bar_cart').prop('type', 'button').change();
var price
</code></pre>

<p>I'm at the end of my knowledge. What causes this?</p>

<p>The delimiter accessed through the global variable is <code>;</code>. It is defined in a file called <code>functions.php</code>, that is included through <code>require_once(""functions.php);</code> in the index.php (code above).</p>

<p>The following shows the text file being parsed (note that this is not the best solution, but is the first incremental step towards a full blown database).</p>

<pre><code>Foo;Steel;1;20;30;40;4500.3
Bar;Copper;2;20;30;40;4500.3
BarFoo;Steel;3;20;30;40;4500.3
FooBar;Steel;2;20;30;40;4500.3
FooBear;Steel;4;20;30;40;4500.3
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the products (Foo, Bar, ...) are grouped by their product lines (Steel, Copper, ...) and then sorted by the numbers in column 3 (third value in the ;-seperated rows).</p>

<p>Accessing the steel-group <code>echo $lineData[$i]</code> shows the following:</p>

<pre><code>Foo;Steel;1;20;30;40;4500.3
FooBar;Steel;2;20;30;40;4500.3
BarFoo;Steel;3;20;30;40;4500.3
</code></pre>

<p>This is as expected exactly the same as in the file being parsed.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: Changing to another php version (5.4, 5.6) does not resolve the issue.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: In Powershell ""C:\xampp\php\php.exe index.php | Out-File test.html"" produced an html file, that did NOT have the issue described above. So there is a workaround. I will digest further into IntelliJ IDEA.</p>

<p>In the meantime I also removed the <code>&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags which did not fix the issue.</p>

<p>Programming language:  Java</p>

<p>I have a <code>MYSQL</code> database which has around 100,000,000 entries.</p>

<p>I have a a list of values in memory say <code>valueList</code> with around 10,000 entries.</p>

<p>I want to iterate through <code>valueList</code> and check whether each value in this list, has  a match in the database.</p>

<p>This means I have to make atleast 10,000 database calls which is highly inefficient for my application.
Other way would be to load the entire database into memory once, and then do the comparison in the memory itself. This is fast but needs a huge amount of memory.</p>

<p>Could you guys suggest a better approach for this problem?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong></p>

<p>Suppose valueList consists of values like :
<code>{""New"",""York"",""Brazil"",""Detroit""}</code></p>

<p>From the database, I'll have a match for <code>Brazil</code> and <code>Detroit</code>. But not for <code>New</code> and <code>York</code> , though <code>New York</code> would have matched. So the next step is , in case of any remaining non matched  values, I combine them to see if they match now. So In this case, I combine <code>New</code> and <code>York</code> and then find the match. </p>

<p>In the approach I was following before( one by one database call) , this was possible. But in case of the approach of creatign a temp table, this wont be possible</p>

The purpose of this is to demonstrate the autocomplete standards: I'd like to show either the fields prefilled on load, or if the user starts typing their first name it will auto-fill both names.</p>

<p>I'm using autocomplete and the entire page is below, with just two fields.</p>

<p>I submit, then the next time I visit the page, I have to start typing into each field to get the drop-down for auto-complete.  No matter what I do on the first field, I have to tab to the second and start typing there.</p>

<p>I'd like it to fill in all the fields (well, both) when I accept a value in the first field.  How do I get that?  I see it happening in commercial websites, where starting to type in a single field and it pre-fills many other fields. (even if there is a yellow background)</p>

<p>I wanted to test this.</p>

<p>I created a Book Data Contract. Its first version had the following members.</p>

<pre><code>public class Book
{
    [DataMember(IsRequired = false)]
    public long BookID;

    [DataMember(IsRequired = true)]
    public string Title;

    [DataMember(IsRequired = false)]
    public string Author;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The client was created for this version of Contract.</p>

<p>Then I added another member ""Edition"" to the Book and the new version of the Book is </p>

<pre><code>public class Book
{
    [DataMember(IsRequired = false)]
    public long BookID;

    [DataMember(IsRequired = true)]
    public string Title;

    [DataMember(IsRequired = false)]
    public string Author;

    [DataMember(IsRequired = false)]
    public string Edition;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The newer version of the contract works flawlessly with the older vesion of client.
I wanted to Physically see the on wire soap message. I have enabled the client and server side message logging.</p>

<p>I understand that new member ""Edition"" would be taken as Nil and would be while serializing.</p>

<p>But on the client side message, I saw something strange, the following.</p>

<p>The soap envelop looks like this</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;s:Envelope xmlns:s=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/""&gt;

    &lt;/book&gt;
  &lt;/CheckAvailability&gt;
&lt;/s:Body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>My question is how did the client with older version of Data contract know about edition while making communication? or am I missing something here.</p>

<p>Following is the structure of the client side Book's schema.</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;xs:schema xmlns:tns=""http://8fingergenie.com"" elementFormDefault=""qualified"" targetNamespace=""http://8fingergenie.com"" xmlns:xs=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""&gt;

<pre><code>preg_replace('/'.preg_quote($keyword).'/i', ""&lt;span&gt;$0&lt;/span&gt;"", $string)
</code></pre>

<p>What happens here is that I can reuse the found substring with the right ""case letters"". Its hard to explain what I mean but let me give an example:</p>

<p>If the user inputs sweden, then this string is all lowercase letters. But in the result this same word is written as Sweden, so I want it to keep its cases as they are.</p>

<p>it is possible to do this in php by using the matched value $0, as you can see in the php expression.</p>

<p>In JavaScript what I have so far is:</p>

<pre><code>var highlighted_sub = location_sub_name[i].replace(regexp_highlight,""&lt;span class='loc_keyword'&gt;"" + location_keyword + ""&lt;/span&gt;"");
</code></pre>

<p>This replaces the original result with the input from the user, so I get sweden in all lower case letters as the user input them, when I actually want the cases to be as they really are.</p>

Once the jQuery(""#carousel-name"").jcarousel(); is executed, though, the page springs back to what it's supposed to look like.</p>

<p>I assume that the reason we're seeing this in our app but not on any of the examples is because our content is a lot more complex than that of the examples on the jCarousel site and it takes longer for browsers to render the HTML.</p>

Well, I implemented easily moving one rectangle with specific direction which you can see below from my code. Also I tried to add an array with group of rectangles. So again my question is how to implement group of rectangles (3 rows 3 columns, 9 of them, for instance) to move the same way how my one rectangle is moving in the code below????? So basically very right side of group and very left side of the group will hit the border while column in the middle of 3X3 will stay moving between two columns of 3X3.....Any help will appreciated. Thank you...</p>

<h2>Edit (0)</h2>

<p>Well, I found an alternate solution to getting the image. I am still unsure about how to grab the image without a reference. I ended up making a separate class that grabs images, loads them and pulls them in for use. Here's the code for the image class:</p>

<pre><code>import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.imageio.ImageIO;

public class ImageMake{
    private String path;
    private int[] pixels;
    public BufferedImage img;
    // You can make img static depending on how you use it.

    public ImageMake(String path){
        this.path = path;
        load();
    }
    public void load(){
        try{
            img = ImageIO.read(ImageMake.class.getResource(path));
            int w = img.getWidth();
            int h = img.getHeight();
            pixels = new int[w * h];
            img.getRGB(w, h, 0, 0, pixels, 0, w);
        }catch(IOException e){e.printStackTrace();}
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Before I move on, I want to say that the <code>ImageMake.class</code> portion can be interchanged for <code>getClass()</code>, so the declaration would end up being:  </p>

<p><code>img = ImageIO.read(getClass().getResource(path));</code></p>

<p>So now, in another class, you would do something along the lines of this:</p>

<pre><code>// Your code...
ImageMake image = new ImageMake(""/res/textures/smiley.png"");
genericJFrame.setIconImage(image.img); // This is just a random JFrame
// More of your code...
</code></pre>

<p>So now I will talk about some <em>important</em> things that people who have never dealt with images in java before (like myself) should know.</p>

<p>Remember in the ImageMake class that I posted above, there was code that went like:</p>

<pre><code>img = ImageIO.read(ImageMake.class.getResource(path));
</code></pre>

<p>Well the ImageMake.class part references the folder where your class is on whatever storage device you're using.</p>

<p>In my case, the ImageMake class was in the directory: C:\Users\Charlie\Documents\Overall</p>

<p>In this same folder, I made another folder called ""res"" and then another folder inside that one called ""textures"" and then added a .png image called ""smiley.png""</p>

<p>When you pass in the string 'path' for the image, it is starting the search within the folder which your class is located in. In my case I had to pass in ""/res/textures/smiley.png"" Make sure you're using the forward slash ""/"", otherwise you may get a compile-time error 'illegal escape character', or some run-time error.</p>

<p>So the overall, out-of-code directory to reach my image ended up being this: C:\Users\Charlie\Documents\Overall\res\textures\smiley.png</p>

<p>Here is the semi-finished code for the main class:</p>

<p>One thing I was thinking about was rendering a mobile view. The basic node code would be...</p>

<pre><code>router.get(""/components"", function(req, res) {
  var mobile = isMobile(req.headers[""user-agent""]);

  res.render(""components"" + (mobile ? ""-mobile"" : """");
});
</code></pre>

<p>In this way, I could render a more mobile friendly view that uses less JavaScript, and render a fuller, richer SPA on the desktop.</p>

<p>Wondering, if, and why this may or may not be a bad idea and any alternatives you may have.</p>

<p>I am creating a database model for a simple forum. Users should be able to create threads, add posts and post an image with their post.</p>

<p>In a view I would like to display all threads and:</p>

<ul>
<li>get the fields of the first post in the thread to show a part of the post/creation date etc (including an optional image)</li>
<li>get the time of the last post in the thread</li>
<li>count posts in a thread</li>
<li>count the images in a thread</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe this is not really possible without executing <code>n</code> queries for <code>n</code> threads, so the real question is how to redesign the database to make that possible.</p>

<pre><code>class Thread(models.Model):
    sticky = models.BooleanField()
    ...

class Post(models.Model):
    thread = models.ForeignKey('Thread')
    image = models.OneToOneField('Image', null=True, blank=True, default=None)
    date = models.DateTimeField()
    ...

class Image(models.Model):
    image = models.ImageField(...)
    ...
</code></pre>

<h3>My partial solution</h3>

<p>At this point I know how to count posts and images but I have no idea how to fetch the first post at the same time. I thought about adding additional field in the <code>Thread</code> model linking to the first <code>Post</code>.</p>

<p>My query which forces me to download first posts separately:</p>

<pre><code>Thread.objects.annotate(
    replies=Count('post'),
    images=Count('post__image'),
    last_reply=Max('post_date')
)

<li>In a nutshell, new tumblr posts are being infnitely scrolled via

<li>The inview plugin listens for new posts to come into the viewport, if the top of an image is shown, it makes it visible.</li>

The performance of the hardware dictates essentially how fast this happens. As I understand, a game will attempt to draw as quickly as possible so redraw operations are essentially wrapped in a while loop. The graphics operations (graphics engine) will then be optimised to ensure the frame rate is acceptable for the application.</p>

<p>Graphics hardware supporting Vertical Synchronisation however locks frame rates to the display rate. A first question would be how should a graphics engine interact with the hardware synchronisation? Is this even possible or does the renderer work at maximum speed and the hardware selectively calls up the latest frame, discarding all unused previous frames..?</p>

<p>The motivation for this question is not that I am immediately intending to write a graphics engine, instead am debugging an issue with an existing system where the graphics of a moving scene appear to stutter onscreen. Symptomatically, the stutter is slight when VSync is turned off, when it is turned on either there is a significant and periodic stutter or alternatively the stutter is resolved entirely. I am somewhat clutching at straws as to what is happening or why, want to understand some more background information on graphics systems.</p>

<p>Summarily the question would be on how one is expected to interact with hardware redraw events and if that is even possible. However any additional information would be welcome.</p>

<p>The transmitA and transmitB is almost the same code which get the LINEAR sound from the local computer and convert them into GSM_RTP or ULAW_RTP, only the port for the transmit is not the same. Finally datasink for the mediaLocator to the other computer.</p>

<p>The problem I'm running into is from what (I assume) is a common trick regarding footers. I usually set the background color for my HTML element to be the footer's color, that way if the page is shorter than the browser window the footer appears to continue on (since the BODY element ends and then the HTML element is what shows until the end of the page). Doing this, however, leaves the scrollbar based on the footer's color, not the content area's color. </p>

<p>Are there any other tricks to make footers continue when the page is shorter than the window, or anyway to force the color of Lion's scrollbars (ick)?</p>

<p>Would this keep working once users starts pulling from other repositories, merging their work, etc.?</p>

<p>In other words it would be a repositories where resolving merging issues wouldn't be a concern and where ""push -f"" and creating new heads would be very welcome and where the working directory's parent would <strong>always</strong> stays at ""changeset 0"".  It's only goal would be to serve as ""changesets backup"" folder (for example to backup changesets that haven't been integrated yet in our real workflow).</p>

<p>Would this work and does this make any sense?</p>

<p>(note that should this not make any sense wouldn't make the question less interesting, other people may want to do exactly this and then may want to find why it wouldn't make sense)</p>

Next time my app checks if there is anything to process it encounters 10000 records and tries to process that. It's not very well engineered and it just not scale good enough.

<li>project is managed according to <a href=""https://golang.org/doc/code.html"" rel=""nofollow"">How to Write Go Code</a> official recommendations. The local project path is: <code>$GOPATH/src/a/b/c</code>. Also all imports are ""not relative"".</li>
<li>the project has <em>go get</em>-able dependencies </li>

<p>Now I want to use some dependency manager tool like <a href=""https://github.com/mattn/gom"" rel=""nofollow"">gom</a> or <a href=""https://github.com/tools/godep"" rel=""nofollow"">godep</a>. Each of this tool creates an extra directory in repository and puts all vendor dependencies there. Also it plays with <code>GOPATH</code> and sets it to that vendor directory. Let's assume that the tool will put all vendors in <code>path_to_project/.vendor</code> - becoming a new <code>GOPATH</code>.</p>

<p>I want to use one of the go tools (<code>gofmt</code>, <code>gorename</code>, ...) being aware about packages in my projects and vendor directory. The problem is that if <code>GOPATH=path_to_project/.vendor</code> (<em>godep</em> does this) then tools are not aware about packages in my project.</p>

<p>One idea for this is to set a <code>GOPATH=path_to_project/.vendor:GOPATH</code> in a shell end editors. Or call every command with <code>gom exec</code> (gom sets a GOPATH in the above proposition)</p>

<p><strong>Is there any ready and automatic solution for this?</strong> </p>

...more...
</code></pre>

<p>I have 11 tables to sync between source and target...<br>
Is there a way to group my query beans ?</p>

<p>My synchronizations must be performed on several databases.<br>
For example, I have 3 sites in different places, 1 site is SOURCE (A), 2 sites are TARGET (B &amp; C) ; with a form (made with YUI), I should be able to sync A->B and A->C.<br>
To sum up :<br>
1- with my form I select a SOURCE, and a TARGET (serveral databases),<br>
2- my form send (in Ajax), the selected SOURCE and selected TARGET to my controller,<br>
3- my controller points to the good database.</p>

<p>What is the best way to do this ?<br>
Using a Factory ?
Using setDataSource ?<br>

<p>I am trying to achieve this by using this code (not successfully), but instead of printing the first split i want to save it and carry on with the 2nd split. whould anyone have a solution to ths problem or better way of going about splitting a string twice? thanks</p>

please take a look at the main slider. This is not owl carousel, I don't know what it is but it works fine (height is set to 100%) - and it's too heavy. </p>

<p>I have changed it to owl carousel, see this <a href=""http://lukaszradwan.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lukaszradwan.com/</a>

<p>I can also negotiate via TCP/IP, Can I send my XML to a web service using a TCP/IP connection?</p>

<h1>If there is any other way that do the job I really appreciate it.</h1>

<p>Currently I am connecting Magik to a Java application and when I need to call a web service I send my request to that Java application (there is a Jar file which creates a data-bus between a Magik session and a Java Application) I have also wrote the Java part using Axis technology. But this is a very hard job and I should change a lot of things to only keep my project up and match with a small change in web service that I consume.

I have created a list of all combinations of predictors and I made benchmark ARIMA model, into which I want to add external variables- Comp.1 : Comp.10

<p>I understand that this limitation is because there is no 'Id' to associate a request to its response, so the only way to match a response with its request is to send the response on the same socket that sent the request. There would be no way to match a response to its request if there was more than one pending request on the socket because we may not receive the responses in the same order requests were sent.</p>

<p>If the protocol had been designed to have a matching 'Id' for requests and responses, there could be multiple pending requests on only one socket. This could greatly reduce the number of socket used by internet browsers and applications using web services.</p>

<p>Was HTTP designed like this for simplicity even if it's less efficient or am I missing something and this is the best approach?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

Assistant for media department
_______

Job roles:
Manager for IT department
</pre>

<p>So how would I get each persons information (from the people table) along with their job details (from the job_roles table) to output like the example above. I guess it would be some kind of way of merging their jobs and their relevant departments into a jobs column that can be split up for output, but maybe there is a better way and what would the sql look like?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The part I haven't figured out is how to take the left nibble and convert it to hex.  The same problem I have is to take the right nibble and use it as a value as well.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if there is a way to do this using bitwise ops or not.  I need an efficient way to do this.</p>

<p>I have a client that is a large organization of 1,500+ users at 7-8 different locations. The application is a PHP application build on the Kohana v3.0 framework. The organization sits behind a proxy filtering server at the ISP level. Each location has one main public IP address that funnels through the proxy then to the web. Each user has a Mac or Windows workstation issued by the employer.</p>

<p>What they are experiencing appears to be cookie collisions. Example: One user logs in at their workstation then another user logs in from the same location, different workstation, with the same OS and browser type. The second user receives the first users' active session by receiving a newly generated cookie (token) that matches the first user. This appears to only be related to the 'authautologin' cookie (set when the remember me check-box is engaged on the login screen), but I'm keeping my options open to caching from the proxy (I can't prove that the proxy is caching yet).</p>

<p>Because of the network setup, the server sees hundreds of users logging in from the same IP address with the same user agent. My initial thought is that the Kohana v3's way of generating cookies that are unique to the browser (user agent) is not unique enough for this real-world application.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? And what would be the proper actions to take in cookie and session generation? Would managing cookies and active sessions in the database be better?</p>

So imagine a car is travelling in a bearing of angle 168 and makes a right turn on a road. Now I need to calculate the new heading or bearing angle just using Gyroscope. But the values I receive are in radians/sec. I tried integrating these values over the time period dT. But these values are not even close to the actual angles. I thought the rotation are in reference to the device, and I tried to convert the values to the real World coordinates. But I didnt get a good algorithm for that.</p>

<p>Can someone help me or point to the right resources to solve this issue?</p>

<p>EDIT:
I forgot to mention in the question, I am trying to do this without GPS, (in the scenario when GPS fails.) And I am trying to avoid Sensor fusion as I am planning to use only Gyroscope as I am looking for a solution that could run even out of Android platform. I am even talking to the OBD to get the actual speed of the vehicle. So I am just trying to collect Gyroscope data from any client and process it at the back end and determine just the turning of a vehicle</p>

<p>I developed it with iphone iOS 2.2.1 originally and tested and kept selling it up until 3.2 without issues.</p>

<p>Now it fails to launch with iOS4.</p>

<p>the app uses a non standard size for a UIPickerView (I don't think that's the problem but just mention it as you will see some complaint in the console output). It's also giving previously non reported <code>NSAutoreleasePool</code> warnings.</p>

<p>But the culprit seems to be when resizing the interface to the new iphone screen resolution (at least what I get from the console)</p>

<p>I know I have to do some research of my own but iOS4 has been out for so little and I have been very absorbed learning and developing my first app for android (so I have not tested this particular code, after a year+ this app only sells a few copies a day) that I thought it didn't harm to ask around here to check if someone has some info or has run into it already.</p>

<p>First, this is the console output when build and run with XCODE 3.2.3 and BASE SDK 3.2, runs without problem</p>

Here is what the output of an isocahedron looks like: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/fraguada/69d523af7f75049db39e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/fraguada/69d523af7f75049db39e</a></p>

<p>Here is an image describing what I see in the program used to create the object (left) and in the threejs editor (right): <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/VeALbgE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/VeALbgE.jpg</a></p>

<p>If I would have to guess the issue, I'd say it is the way I am passing the color to JSON.  I get access to the RGB values of each mesh vertex and convert the values to an int:</p>

<pre><code>public int ColorToInt(Color color)
{
     string c = color.R.ToString(""X2"") + color.G.ToString(""X2"") + color.B.ToString(""X2"");
     return Convert.ToInt32(c, 16);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Checking the color output, things seem ok.  The first vertex color I process on this model is 127,255,0 (R,G,B,) which translates to 8388352 or 7fff00.  I assume I need the 8388352 representation in the JSON file as this is the format used in the examples I've looked at.</p>

<p>Based on the JSON file, is there anything obvious that would make the vertex colors not work in the threejs editor?  I've tried some other files (not generated by my exporter) and they all have the vertex colors showing.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The above testmethod works properly when I put </p>

<pre><code>  HttpContext.Session[""ProductList""] = listViewproductModel;

<p>1) I have <strong>multiple</strong> left joins each with <strong>multiple</strong> AND conditions, the AND conditions are now via restrictions in the generated WHERE clause, so the number of results are less than expected. (The join AND is not equal to a WHERE condition).
Question How to add a additional AND in the left join?
E.g:</p>

<pre><code>left join cc c

<p>3) Two left joined tables, depending on a field value in the base table, the first or the second table should be joined/give rows.</p>

<p>The first three classes are:</p>

<pre><code>class Appointment{
    static mapping = {
    id          column: 'Id'
    employer    column: 'EMP_ID'
    appDate     column: 'Date'

class Contract {
    static mapping = {
    id          column: 'CNT_ID'
    employer    column: 'EMP_ID'
    validFrom   column: 'CNT_STARTDATE'
    validUntil  column: 'CNT_ENDDATE'
    specialContract column: 'SpecialContract'
    }
    static belongsTo = [employer: Employer]
</code></pre>

<p>The used criteria (extraction);</p>

<pre><code>        def appointments = Appointment.createCriteria().list {

                }
            order ('date', 'asc')
        }
</code></pre>

       and app.appdate &lt; cnt.cnt_validUntil 
</code></pre>

<p>Update 2015-09-07</p>

<p>I have now switched to HQL because of the WITH clause, but it is still not working for me.</p>

<p>Native</p>

<pre><code>inner join agenda a on a.id = agr.agendaid
left join contract cnt on agr.wgv_id = cnt.wgv_id and agr.date &gt;= cnt.cnt_validfrom and agr.date &lt; cnt.cnt_validtill
</code></pre>

<p>HQL</p>

<pre><code>from Agenda agr inner join agr.agenda a with a.employee.id = :employeeId
left join agr.employer wgr
left join wgr.contracts cnt with agr.date &gt;= cnt.validFrom and agr.date &lt; cnt.ValidUntil
</code></pre>

<p>Error and generated SQL
with-clause referenced two different from-clause elements [</p>

<pre><code>select ..

left join agr.employer wgr

<p>Seems that the WITH clause only works correct with a combination of field and parameter, and not with field = field
What is the correct syntax for the WITH AND AND clause?</p>

"16145244","1","","","2013-04-22 10:48:56","","0","210","<p>I am trying to build a knowledge management system that in small way tries to mimic human ability to learn. It deals with both, new instances of concepts that it already knows, which allows it to further improve/specialize the knowledge base for the known concept(s). It can also learn new concepts that it has never encountered before. When it encounters new concepts it creates relationships with existing concepts. I am thinking that the native object oriented paradigm of a programming language itself could be an ideal data model for knowledge representation. For example <em>classes</em> are concepts (things) which has <em>attributes</em> that describe the concept and <em>methods</em> that describe how it (concept/thing) interacts. Hence a car is a generic concept hence modelled as a <em>class</em> while my specific car would be an <em>object</em> instance of that car. It obviously benefit from inheritance and up/down navigation ability provided by object oriented languages in dealing with classes and objects. Given the strong dynamic nature of Python, I am planning on using it for this purpose.</p>

<p>Couple of implications of such a learning system are,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Since the system learns new things about concepts (classes and objects) it already knows, it will have to modify the definition of classes dynamically by adding/deleting attributes (including methods) in addition to changing attribute values, thus a static definition of classes won't suffice. Methods are especially tricky since there is code associated with them.</p></li>
<li><p>As it encounters new concepts it would have to create new classes dynamically.</p></li>
<li><p>Each time the system starts it should start with all the prior knowledge loaded into the system for the obvious reason. In this case it means all the ""current"" versions (including any added/deleted or changed attributes/values/methods) of all knowledge classes (including dynamically created ones) i.e. a fairly comprehensive serialization/persistence mechanism is required.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>At the end of the session (tear-down), it would have to look at ""all"" knowledge classes and objects and serialize them. Some might have gotten defined newly, some might have changed their attributes or even methods (codes). Need a way to get all these objects/classes, their most up to date definition and serialize them for persistence.</p>

<p>Next time the system runs, during initialization, it needs to read and execute all the class definitions and restore the state of object instances.</p>

<p>I have looked around and found piecemeal solutions such as pickle, json, ZODB, inspect module etc. but none seem to be able to serialize dynamic classes including code for the methods.</p>

<p>A similar question was asked here <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4574053/python-saving-and-loading-a-class-definition"">Python: saving and loading a class definition</a>
but most respondents thought that there wasn't any compelling use-case for this. </p>

<p>Any leads would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<pre><code>$xoptions = get_option('xsettings');
</code></pre>

<p>So that on my page I can reference $xoptions[""first_name""] to pull given settings, and have them saved and updated automatically via Wordpress' Options.php. The problem is, I can't read or set values in the $xoptions associative array manually without having to use the ""xsettings[first_name]"" syntax that gets buried in the HTML and submitted with a form. I need to update these values without sending a form.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do, basically, is set the value of one of those values manually like this:</p>

<pre><code>$xoptions['first_name'] = ""Derek Walters"";
</code></pre>

<p>but that doesn't work as it would with a normal associative array. I'm wondering if there's a way to manually read and write names/values from Worpress Options.</p>

<p>I've tried setting it manually with</p>

<pre><code>update_option('first_name',$_POST['name']);
</code></pre>

<p>Any help would be fantastic. Thanks in advance! I've been Googling for hours and trying different slabs of code and haven't figured out if it's even possible.</p>

I'm using a method from the book 'iOS Games by tutorials' (highly recommended- very informative book) as a guideline, as I'm new to it.</p>

<p>I got everything to work fine, but after I close the game.. and my iPhone been sitting for right around 20-30 minutes - I come back to the game and the Scrolling BG is blank for 5-15 seconds then it loads and scrolls.  Oddly, when I first test the game - it loads immediately no issues.  I also have nodes / graphics and they all load quickly each and every time no issues.</p>

<p>Here's the main code snippet that's being updated every frame:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)moveWave
{

    CGPoint waveVelocity = CGPointMake(-wave_speed, 0);
    CGPoint amtToMove = CGPointMultiplyScalar(waveVelocity, _dt);
    _waveLayer.position = CGPointAdd(_waveLayer.position, amtToMove);

    [_waveLayer enumerateChildNodesWithName:@""wave""
                               usingBlock:^(SKNode *node, BOOL *stop){
                                   SKSpriteNode * wave = (SKSpriteNode *) node;
                                   CGPoint waveScreenPos = [_waveLayer convertPoint:wave.position
                                                                         toNode:self];
                                   if (waveScreenPos.x &lt;= -wave.size.width) {
                                       wave.position = CGPointMake(wave.position.x+wave.size.width*2,
                                                                 wave.position.y);
                                   }
                               }];

}

<hr>

<p>Any help or insight to why coming back to the iPhone being idle for 20 minutes then load the game back up, only the scrolling BG is missing but after 5-15 seconds , it starts and looks fine.  Again, when I first load it.. or exit out for 5 minutes then go back into game.. everything is working and loads immediately.</p>

<p>EDIT - I know it's the scrolling function/method because I have tried just loading the BG image without scrolling and it loads fine even after I have quit the game for 20+ minutes and come back.  hmmmm.. I can play the game even when the scrolling BG isn't loaded.  The scrolling BG always loads eventually - usually 5-10 seconds later.</p>

<p>In SQL, this would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>select
   key_value,
   col1,
   col2,
   col3,
   row_number() over (partition by key_value order by col1, col2 desc, col3)
from
   temp
;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's say in Spark I have an RDD of the form (K, V), where V=(col1, col2, col3), so my entries are like</p>

<pre><code>(key1, (1,2,3))
(key1, (1,4,7))
(key1, (2,2,3))
(key2, (5,5,5))
(key2, (5,5,9))
(key2, (7,5,5))
etc.
</code></pre>

<p>I want to order these using commands like sortBy(), sortWith(), sortByKey(), zipWithIndex, etc. and have a new RDD with the correct row_number</p>

<pre><code>(key1, (1,2,3), 2)
(key1, (1,4,7), 1)
(key1, (2,2,3), 3)
(key2, (5,5,5), 1)
(key2, (5,5,9), 2)
(key2, (7,5,5), 3)
etc.
</code></pre>

<p>(I don't care about the parentheses, so the form can also be (K, (col1,col2,col3,rownum)) instead)</p>

<p>How do I do this?</p>

<p>Here's my first attempt:</p>

<pre><code>val sample_data = Seq(((3,4),5,5,5),((3,4),5,5,9),((3,4),7,5,5),((1,2),1,2,3),((1,2),1,4,7),((1,2),2,2,3))

val temp1 = sc.parallelize(sample_data)

temp1.collect().foreach(println)

// ((3,4),5,5,5)
// ((3,4),5,5,9)
// ((3,4),7,5,5)
// ((1,2),1,2,3)
// ((1,2),1,4,7)
// ((1,2),2,2,3)

temp1.map(x =&gt; (x, 1)).sortByKey().zipWithIndex.collect().foreach(println)

// ((((1,2),1,2,3),1),0)
// ((((1,2),1,4,7),1),1)
// ((((1,2),2,2,3),1),2)
// ((((3,4),5,5,5),1),3)
// ((((3,4),5,5,9),1),4)
// ((((3,4),7,5,5),1),5)

// note that this isn't ordering with a partition on key value K!

val temp2 = temp1.???
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that the function sortBy cannot be applied directly to an RDD, but one must run collect() first, and then the output isn't an RDD, either, but an array</p>

<pre><code>temp1.collect().sortBy(a =&gt; a._2 -&gt; -a._3 -&gt; a._4).foreach(println)

// ((1,2),1,4,7)
// ((1,2),1,2,3)
// ((1,2),2,2,3)
// ((3,4),5,5,5)
// ((3,4),5,5,9)
// ((3,4),7,5,5)
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a little more progress, but still not partitioned:</p>

<pre><code>val temp2 = sc.parallelize(temp1.map(a =&gt; (a._1,(a._2, a._3, a._4))).collect().sortBy(a =&gt; a._2._1 -&gt; -a._2._2 -&gt; a._2._3)).zipWithIndex.map(a =&gt; (a._1._1, a._1._2._1, a._1._2._2, a._1._2._3, a._2 + 1))

temp2.collect().foreach(println)

// ((1,2),1,4,7,1)
// ((1,2),1,2,3,2)
// ((1,2),2,2,3,3)
// ((3,4),5,5,5,4)
// ((3,4),5,5,9,5)
// ((3,4),7,5,5,6)

<p>First, I have enabled migration &amp; set the version to 1.
Then, I have created a <code>file 001_create_users.php</code> and added the following code.</p>

<pre><code>class Migration_Create_users extends CI_Migration {

    public function up(){

        $this-&gt;dbforge-&gt;add_field(
            array(
                'id'        =&gt; array('type'=&gt;'INT', 'constraint'=&gt;11, 'unsigned'=&gt;TRUE, 'auto_increment'=&gt;TRUE),
                'email'     =&gt; array('type'=&gt;'VARCHAR', 'constraint'=&gt;100),
                'password'  =&gt; array('type'=&gt;'VARCHAR', 'constraint'=&gt;255),
                'created'      =&gt; array('type'=&gt;""TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"")
            )
        );

        $this-&gt;dbforge-&gt;add_key('id');
        $this-&gt;dbforge-&gt;create_table('users');

    }

    public function down(){

        $this-&gt;dbforge-&gt;drop_table('users');

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to change the column name '<code>date</code>' to '<code>created_at</code>'. So how should I do it? I mean what is the best way to do it? 
Also can anyone explain me how to do a rollback? Because I have used the folwing controller to run the migration. </p>

<pre><code>class Migration extends Admin_Controller{

    public function __construct(){
        parent::__construct();
    }

    public function index($version){

        $this-&gt;load-&gt;library('migration');

        if( !$this-&gt;migration-&gt;version($version)){
            show_error($this-&gt;migration-&gt;error_string());
        }
        echo ""I'm in Migration"";
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>So, If I run <a href=""http://localhost/migration/index/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/migration/index/1</a> It will run the up() function. What should I do to perform a rollback via browser? Can I create another method and call it?</p>

<p>I still do not understand how the migration actually works, Can anyone please explain it to me?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

Any ideas as to why this may be?</p>

For completeness, I also tried with</p>

I have a couple of options;</p>

<p>1) install FFMPEG on the same server that handles file uploads, when a video is uploaded and stored on EC2 instance, call FFMPEG to convert it then when done, write the file to S3 bucket and dispose of the original. </p>

<p>How scalable is this? What happens when many users upload at the same time? How do I manage multiple processes at once? How do I know when to start another instance and load balance this configuration?</p>

<p>2) Have one server for processing uploads (updating database, renaming files etc) and one server for doing transcoding. Again what is the best way to manage multiple processes? should I be looking at Amazon SQS for this? Can I tell the transcoding server to get the file from the upload server or should I copy the file to the transcoding server? Should I just store all files on S3 and SQS can read from there. I am trying to have as little traffic as possible.</p>

<p>I am running a linux box as the upload server and have FFMPEG running on this. </p>

<p>Any advice on best practices for setting up such a configuration would be appreciated. Many thanks</p>

My app is split into 3 layers (View,Service(Business),DAO) and I want to perform the auth in the Service layer. So, for a method that take as an argument a domain object :  </p>

<pre><code>@PreAuthorize(""hasPermission(#proj,'write'"")
public Project updateProject(Project proj) {
 .............
}

<p>the problem is solved with annotations.<br>
But for a method that take as an argument an object that does not have an acl on it I have to programmatically check if user has permission.<br>
Let`s say i have an object ProjectWrapper:  </p>

<pre><code>public class ProjectWrapper {

    private Project project;    
    private Something something;
    // setters and getters here 
}

<p>so now my Service method received this type of argument:  </p>

<pre><code>public Project updateProject(ProjectWapper projWrapp) {

   Project p = projWrapp.getProject();
   // before performing any operation on project I need to know if current user has neccessary permissions on this object 
  // ??? how do i check that ?

}

<p>Do i need to use AclService to perform that ? just like when I need to create/update a permission, or is there an cleaner/nicer possibility ?<br>

<p>The translations are stored in separate translation tables.</p>

<p>This is all fine but it leaves me with the problem that I now get the translated values in my 'default' values when I update the entity using the translations. And I don't want that.</p>

<p>Let me try and explain better.</p>

<p>Database:<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/6UfuX.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The mapping of footprintlinevLue:</p>

<pre><code>public class FootprintLineValueMap : ClassMap&lt;FootprintLineValue&gt; {
 public FootprintLineValueMap() {
    Table(""FootprintLineValue"");

    Id(x =&gt; x.Id).GeneratedBy.Identity().Column(""Id"");
    References(x =&gt; x.FootprintLine).Column(""FootprintLineId"");
    References(x =&gt; x.CategoryValue).Column(""CategoryValueId"").Cascade.None();

  }
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see a footprintline has multiple values that reference a categoryValue. The categoryvalue is localized.</p>

<p>When I now retrieve footprintlines our framework will put it through our translationservice and will automatically translate the Name and Description of the CategoryValue in the corresponding culture. If it cant find a translation in CategoryValueLocal, it will use the default in CategoryValue.</p>

<p>However...if I save a Footprintline, it will save the translated values back into CategoryValue (overwriting the default) instead of ignore it.</p>

<p>CategoryValues are not value objects and could be changed so I cant make them readonly.
I tried to map the reference as Cascade.None, but that doesn't seem to do anything.</p>

<p>I hope there is a way to simply mark this in the mapping so we can keep on using our TranslationService instead of having to figure out another way to hande localization.</p>

<p>The problem is, when I try to use <code>method(int in)</code> with an instance of the <code>Derived</code> class, like:</p>

<pre><code>Derived d;
int res = d.method(5);
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler (icc in this case, but have also tried with msvc) gives me the following error: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>error #165: too few arguments in function call</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that the compiler is not realizing that there exists an overload which only takes one parameter, from the <code>Base&lt;Derived&gt;</code> class (from which <code>Derived</code> inherits publicly, so I think it should be accesible).</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I'm missing here, any hints will be deeply appreciated.</p>

Currently, I'm initializing all my commands and storing them in a map with the name (string) of the command as the key and the object as the value. Whenever the servlet receives a request, I get the command from the map by passing the command query from url as:</p>

<pre><code>// at init
Hashmap&lt;String, DomainCommand&gt; commands = new Hashmap&lt;String, DomainCommand&gt;();
commands.put(""someCommand"", new SomeCommand());

// at request
String command = request.getParameter(""command"");
DomainCommand c = commands.get(command);
c.execute();
</code></pre>

<p>This works well and does what I want since my DomainCommands have no class attributes to be shared between threads. An alternative to this is using reflection to create the object like so:</p>

<pre><code>String command = request.getParameter(""command"");
DomainCommand c = Class.forName(command).newInstance(); // assuming in same (default) package
c.execute();
</code></pre>

<p>Both of these work. Which is better from a performance/memory saving point of view? </p>

<p>I don't know the gotchas of calling a post back like this. As the string being passed into the method is the name of the input button. It seems like the name may be able to change. I also don't know what the $ctl stuff means. </p>

<pre><code>var next = this.get(""next""),

<p>I can detect the angle and whether we're within the snap-to-45 zone easy enough, and I know which angle we ought to set it to.  What I don't know how to find is the x,y given that new angle.</p>

<pre><code>if(CLOSE_ENOUGH_TO_SNAP) {

<p>When I open the camera, flips camera, again flips camera and press cancel. Do it a few times ( 3 - 5 ) . Open again the camera and I have a black freeze screen for a few seconds and if you take a picture see the image but the screen continue in black. After a few seconds the camera appears again and you can continue with the normal behavior. But I cant find a solution to this. </p>

I already have a CSS stylesheet for the form, since my company is part of the government and they have a preset branding. So I wanted to change the HTML used by the default form theme functions of Drupal thus implementing the correct style.</p>

<p>But only the form-tag of the form gets rendered. The fieldset and elements are not rendered. When the theme functions are removed the default theming kicks in and the form renders normally (but of course without the requested theming).</p>

<p>What I have tried so far:</p>

<h3>Added a hook_theme function to add theme functions</h3>

<pre><code>function publicatieaanvraagformulier_theme() {
  return array(
    'publicatieaanvraagformulier_form' =&gt; array(
   'arguments' =&gt; array(""element"" =&gt; NULL)  
    ),
    'publicatieaanvraagformulier_fieldset' =&gt; array(
      'arguments' =&gt; array(""element"" =&gt; NULL)
    ),
    'publicatieaanvraagformulier_form_element' =&gt; array(
      'arguments' =&gt; array(
        ""element"" =&gt; NULL,
        ""value"" =&gt; NULL
      )
    )
  );
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Added ['#theme'] to the form-element, fieldset-element and the form-elements</h3>

<pre><code>$form['#theme'] = ""publicatieaanvraagformulier_form"";
$form['groep'] = array(
  '#title' =&gt; t(""Please fill in your details""),
  '#type' =&gt; ""fieldset"",
  '#theme' =&gt; ""publicatieaanvraagformulier_fieldset""
);
$form['groep']['organisatie'] = array(
  '#title' =&gt; t(""Organization""),
  '#type' =&gt; ""textfield"",
  '#attributes' =&gt; array(""class"" =&gt; ""text""),
  '#theme' =&gt; ""publicatieaanvraagformulier_form_element""
);
</code></pre>

<h3>Added the actual theme function based on the default ones in form.inc</h3>

<pre><code>function theme_publicatieaanvraagformulier_form($element) {
function theme_publicatieaanvraagformulier_fieldset($element)
function theme_publicatieaanvraagformulier_form_element($element, $value)
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't included the code of these functions because even with the default themefunctions code, they don't work. Therefor I assume they are not the source of the problem.</p>

<h3>The form is called</h3>

<pre><code>//Get the form
$form = drupal_get_form('publicatieaanvraagformulier');

//Add messages
$errors = form_get_errors();
if (!empty($errors)) {
  $output .= theme(""status_messages"",""error"");
} 

//Show form
$output .= $form;
return $output;
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't found similar 'complicated' examples of theming a form, but have pieced together the former from books and online searches. </p>

<p>Hopefully someone has an answer to this problem (point out the mistake I made).</p>

<p>The program takes the user input string and loads the 2 parts in to a multidimensional array and a char variable for the arithmetic symbol.
It is supposed to convert the characters to their numerical equivalence(ASCII) to do the arithmetic.
Then it is supposed to output the values as characters again. When the numerical value exceeds 26 it takes the character from the first part of the string and outputs its capitalized form.</p>

<p><a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/login-with-facebook/#step1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/login-with-facebook/#step1</a></p>

<p>Part of the walkthrough lists changing the MainActivity class to extend FragmentActivity. My MainActivity class, however, already extended it because of a content slider I implemented on the main view. The original onCreate code of MainActivity was:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    // Instantiate a ViewPager and a PagerAdapter.
    mPager = (ViewPager) findViewById(R.id.pager);
    mPagerAdapter = new ScreenSlidePagerAdapter(getFragmentManager());
    mPager.setAdapter(mPagerAdapter);
    mPager.setOnPageChangeListener(new ViewPager.SimpleOnPageChangeListener() {
        @Override
        public void onPageSelected(int position) {
             invalidateOptionsMenu();
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this was working great. Following the Facebook login walkthrough, I added a new 'MainFragment' class following the directions as literally as possible:</p>

<pre><code>public class MainFragment extends Fragment {

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater,
                         ViewGroup container,
                         Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.main, container, false);

    return view;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>, also added a com.facebook.widget.LoginButton to my MainActivity layout (this seems to display fine), and tried to tie it all together by adding the following to the OnCreate section of the MainActivity class (displayed above, but not repeating it all here again for brevity): </p>

<pre><code>    if (savedInstanceState == null) {
        // Add the fragment on initial activity setup
        mainFragment = new MainFragment();
        getSupportFragmentManager()
                .beginTransaction()
                .add(android.R.id.content, mainFragment)
                .commit();
    } else {
        // Or set the fragment from restored state info
        mainFragment = (MainFragment) getSupportFragmentManager()
                .findFragmentById(android.R.id.content);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The question I fundamentally have is how to make both my existing slider and Facebook login play together nicely? If I add the Facebook code needed to OnCreate of MainActivity, then my slider goes away. If I don't add the code, then Facebook login obviously doesn't work. I've read as much as possible on Fragments thinking I might be doing something wrong there, but haven't had much luck...</p>

and others SQL. 
So I have a table where I need to store multiple and unknown attributes and then be able to search on them. The rest of db tables are just simple relational. </p>

<p>Example </p>

<h2>item</h2>

<p>id
name </p>

<ul>
<li>one item can have attribute : color, shape, other item can have attribute : height, width but not any other ones . </li>
</ul>

<p>So it smells like NoSQL, but I do a lot more dev with SQL and I always want to choose technology that I know best.  </p>

<p>I won't be needing a lot of selects by those attributes at the moment so I will just add 
a field ""attributes"" where I will be keeping all attributes as json_encoded string . 
And if i need to select anything by attributes I will write a script for that . </p>

<p>But maybe there's an extra feature of MySQL ( this is what i'm using as RDBMS) that I don't know of ? Or any better ideas ? </p>

<p>I was also thinking of keeping parallel Mongo DB just for 'items' but I generally detest having 
same data in 2 places . </p>

<p>Maybe anyone knows a technology that is Relational DB with NoSQL extension like this ? </p>

<p>That is, their state should be entirely determined at construction, and changes to state should require creating a completely new instance.</p>

<p>But say I'm persisting to a relational DB using an ORM - how do I determine which properties to persist, and how do I reconstruct the domain object based on data in a database?</p>

<p>For example, say I want to write this object to the database:</p>

<pre><code>class User
{
    private string _emailAddress;

    public User(string emailAddress, string password)
    {
       // ... generate hash &amp; seed
       _emailAddress = emailAddress;
    }

    public string PasswordHash { get; private set; }

    public string PasswordSeed { get; private set; }

    public bool ValidatePassword(string password)
    {
       // validate it against the stored hash
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, I want to store the state of the object and retrieve it later. This means storing the PasswordHash, PasswordSeed and EmailAddress.</p>

<p>But the structure of the class prevents me from doing so.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>PasswordHash and PasswordSeed - I can store them, but what happens when I want to read them back from the database and reconstruct the object? There's no constructor parameters to pass them to, and I can't even construct the object without them because 'password' must be supplied and I don't know what the original password was. I can't set the 'PasswordHash' or 'PasswordSeed' properties, because they're 'private set'.</p></li>
<li><p>EmailAddress - I can't store it because even though it's part of the object state, it's marked private and can't be accessed internally.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I could just make every property in the object public and read/write. But then, where's my encapsulation and immutability?</p>

<p>See, I wanted to store the password as a hash/seed and hide the emailaddress for a reason. I wanted to enforce a certain workflow into my domain objects.</p>

<p>But when it comes to storing them, I have to undo all those constraints and turn my domain objects into dumb key/value stores, with no constraints.</p>

<hr>

<p>The underlying problem, it seems, is that relational databases have no concept of encapsulation. Every column in a table is 'public' and every value is 'mutable'.</p>

<p>So does this mean I have to throw out relational mapping altogether if I'm to have an immutable domain model? Or is there some well-known strategy for getting around this that I just don't know about yet?</p>

not change anything, or would it for instance change the 'last time

<p>The situation we've got ourselves into (not sure how) is that we've got 2 branches, both called ""default"", and a tag called ""tip"". Viewing these in bitbucket, both of the branches are out of date, and cloning either of these will get a version of the project that's a year old. But browsing the tag (called ""tip"" - not sure how it got that name) shows the latest changes. </p>

<p>So my partner has made some changes, and I can see them if I browse ""tip"" on bitbucket. But for some reason I can't see them when I pull changes to my local project. It just says ""no changes found"". </p>

<p>I'm not sure how I've got into this mess, but what I think would be best is if the tag could be changed into the default branch, and the second unnecessary branch (also called ""default"") should be closed. </p>

Now i have knowledge in php i created a scraper/spider to get all the required info i need without doing anything by hand</p>

<p>Question - My script runs on my local server collecting all links from the sites sitemap.xml this is uploaded to my database once this script is complete it starts going through the links extracting the data needed Picture, Price, Name, Desc etc... the site i am scraping is not happy that i am doing it due to human/computer errors that can only be spotted by a human, but have allowed it. anyway my script sometimes throws me an error when a item cannot be scraped due to some unknown reasons so i have put a die() when the script throws this error.</p>

<p>This is placed inside the mysql while loop for the links, i have noticed a few times that when an error does occur the script stops loading shows me the exact error, but when i shut down the browser it carries on deleting queries and extracting information i need to manually restart the server before it stops.</p>

<p>How is this possible and what can i do to prevent this? is it the die() statement just kills the client side script and keeps the server side script running ?    </p>

<p>So I have my 3 asynctasks in MyGLSurfaceView extends glSurfaceView class.</p>

<p>I handle onTouchEvents via an override in my GLSurfaceView.</p>

<p>Everything runs directly on the GL thread until it is time to run the mobs through the maze, at which I use a sequence of a Handler h posting a series of ""prepare"" methods loading the mobs for the level, and preparing various other required entities. The last step in this process is to edit the sharedpreferences which in turn triggers the 3 asyncTasks (through the implementation of onSharedPreferencesChangedListenner in MyGLSurfaceView (NOT my Renderer))</p>

<p>On my older devices (Nexus S and an older Samsung galaxy tab), this always works perfectly.
On my Galaxy S4, it only works about 80-90% of the time.
When it doesn't work, various alternate results can occur
:
- The app remains responsive, and keeps drawing everything that is required on screen, minus anything that was changed by the asynctasks; strangely, using Log, I noticed that the asynctasks also seem to be running properly, showing expected values in the log (monsters are moving properly, over the proper path, while towers are correctly firing missiles at them, and these missiles are behaving as expected (causing damage and potentially causing mob death on impact). Visually, I see a clump of mobs on the start waypoint, my towers, my game area, my UI (which remains totally clickable and interative with 0 lag). Just nothing is moving. I noticed, when this behavior is observed, that if I press the home key to trigger onPause, and then return to the app, triggering onResume, the action resumes normally, from the beginning (as if all the previous Log posts from my asynctasks were lost).
This is what usually happens when the app fails.
What could be causing this? Are my asyncTasks sometimes working on a separate instantiation of my renderer? Why does it always work on older devices but not always on the new device?</p>

<ul>
<li>The app crashes, due to a null pointer on my array of mobs (maybe things are executing out of order)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Should I be avoiding asynctask when using openGL es?</p>

<p>Should I even be doing this? (updating mob locations via doInBackground and simply drawing the objects with their latest coordinates (as determined in the asynctask))</p>

The connection between them was created with the help of C# tool itself (databinding or something). It has 5 collumns and only two of the have numeric format. One of them is double, altho, when i'm saving (from the datagridview) let's say, 1172,44 into Microsoft Access and then, re-open the application, the number i get is 117244 (which misses the comma). I don't know what's causing this, i have tried switching to decimal, single and of course double. Tryed using the <code>System.CultureInfo</code> way to go around but it just seems like it won't fix anything. Also tried to parse the number on the fly but couldn't do it. The last thread i did was closed because Apparently it was vague..<br>
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10093386/saving-a-double-value-to-access-database-from-c-sharp"">Saving a double value to Access Database From C#</a> There it is so you can see what i've progressed since i started playing around with all the settings and configurations. I don't really know what else to do and i just really think updating an Access database with a double should be an easy task but it's not as it seems.</p>

<p>Code Used to Update Access Database from Datagridview:  </p>

<pre><code>private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    try {
        this.Validate();
        this.tabelaTesteBindingSource.EndEdit();
        this.tabelaTesteTableAdapter.Update(database1DataSet);
        MessageBox.Show(""Guardado com sucesso!!"");
    } catch (System.Exception ex) {
        MessageBox.Show(""A gravação falhou!!"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>after this i close the apllication, load it again and the number 1172,44 is gone and it shows as 117244!</p>

<p>I am using the twitter4j library to load statuses from a usertimeline 10 at a time using a pager (Paging class)</p>

<p>my issue here comes when i am trying to update the listview when it reaches the bottom using the enlessScrollListener , i am successfully getting more tweets and calling the refill method in the adapter but the adapter is refusing to refill, </p>

<p>I noted that when i call the refill method with the new updated list, the old list successfully clears but the addAll() method in the adapter is resulting into an empty list and nothing is available for the adapter to adapt thus resulting to an empty view,.</p>

<p>A weird issue is that in the PostExecute method if i append the new data to the beginning of the list instead of using the addAll() method then the adapter will successfully  display the list but in a jumbled order.</p>

<p>If possible I would love to be informed of a better way to load old tweets as user scrolls to the bottom.</p>

<p>As you might know, each video link in youtuube contains direct links to the video.
When the page uses the flash flayer (and not html5 or so), it is stored in the flash object (in it's flashvar attr).
My app parses that flash object and extract from it those direct links (one link for each available video quality).</p>

<p>I get the flash object's html code by downloading the video's html code (e.g <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEOID"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEOID</a>) and parsing it.</p>

<p>I use asynctask to dowload the html code (the non mobile version), and here is my downloading code :</p>

<pre><code>      HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();
      client.getParams().setParameter(CoreProtocolPNames.USER_AGENT, ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:8.0.1)"");

<p>Now I got a little problem:</p>

<p>The code above doesn't download the whloe html code. The downloaded html string gets cut somewhere in the middle and I don't get the flash object part. This function works fine with other sites!</p>

<p>Is there any documentation (eg c++ standard) to support the validity of defining a C++ class using the style:</p>

<pre><code>namespace N { class X; }
class N::X { ... }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>

<p>We use a couple of styles in some of our company's code to define classes:</p>

<pre><code>// n_x.h - style 1
namespace N {
  class X;
}

class N::X {...}
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>// n_y.h - style 2
namespace N {
  class Y;
}

namespace N {
  class Y { ... };
}
</code></pre>

<p>The key difference here is between <code>class N::X</code> in <em>style 1</em> and <code>namespace N { class Y {...}... </code> in <em>style 2</em>, ie we wrap class Y in <em>style 2</em> in a namespace.</p>

<p>Both styles seem valid to me (we've never had problems compiling them on VS20xx and Clang), but a colleague has questioned whether <em>style 1</em> is valid as a tool we are using to analyse our code doesn't properly recognize <em>class X</em> to be part of the namespace when using <em>style 1</em>.</p>

<p>My hope is that someone can provide me a reference to documentation that shows that <em>style 1</em> is a valid way of defining a class in C++.</p>

<p>Note: the Url in the browser must also become the url of the response.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Here is the goal. This is on a paypal checkout page. Instead of having a form with all cart hidden fields and a checkout submit button in my view, I would like a simple checkout button linked to one of my actions. In this action, I will prepare the WebRequest with the form and send it to paypal. Doing this in an action also allows me to store the inactivated order in a DB table so that when the order confirmation comes I can compare it with the stored order and activate it.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>: thanks to those who answered for pointing out that this would not be possible to redirect with a POST. It appears that I am not obliged to redirect to paypal with a POST. Instead I can construct a URL with all the cart data in the query string and redirect to it. Doing it from a controller action method still allows me to store the pending order in a database.</p>

Much of my logic is currently in a class that inherits from MKAnnotationView.

<p>In order to make this code easier to maintain / debug, I would love to DRY up this code and have both my custom classes inherit from the same class. However, I have not found a suitably clean approach to achieve this inheritance diagram:</p>

              V                   V
        CustomBaseAnnotationImplementation
            /                      \

 MKAnnotationView              MKPinAnnotationView
</code></pre>

<p>I tried doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#if UsesPinAnnotationView
#define CustomStandInSuperClass MKPinAnnotationView
#else
#define CustomStandInSuperClass MKAnnotationView
#endif

@interface CustomBaseAnnotationViewImplementation : CustomStandInSuperClass
</code></pre>

<p>Then putting <code>#define UsesPinAnnotationView 0</code> in my <code>CustomAnnotationView</code> and <code>#define UsesPinAnnotationView 1</code> in my CustomPinAnnotationView, and none of that worked like I thought it would (I think it just used the first #define the preprocessor came to and discarded the other #define -- in the end it made it a MKAnnotationView subclass in all cases and my code successfully compiled, but then crashed on an unrecognizedSelector (setAnimatesDrop:)</p>

<p>I have been researching using the ObjC Runtime API to add methods to my concrete subclasses from the common implementation file at runtime, but it doesn't seem that's a feasible (or necessary) solution here. </p>

<p>So, this isn't multiple inheritance... it's variable inheritance. Seems like something that should be do-able without circumventing constraints of the framework. Any ideas?</p>

A gene is started with ATG, and ends with either TAA, TAG, or TGA (the gene excludes both endpoints). The gene consists of triplets of letters, so its length is a multiple of three, and none of those triplets can be the start/end triplets listed above. So, for the string above the genes in it are CTCTCT and CACACACACACA. And in fact my regex works for that particular string. Here's what I have so far (and I'm pretty happy with myself that I got this far):</p>

<pre><code>(?&lt;=ATG)(([ACGT]{3}(?&lt;!ATG))+?)(?=TAG|TAA|TGA)
</code></pre>

<p>However, if there is an ATG and end-triplet within another result, and not aligned with the triplets of that result, it fails. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Results for TCGAATGTTGCTTATTGTTTTGAATGGGGTAGGATGACCTGCTAATTGGGGGGGGGG :
TTGCTTATTGTTTTGAATGGGGTAGGA
ACCTGC

<p>It should find also a GGG but doesn't: TTGCTTATTGTTTTGA(ATG|GGG|TAG)GA</p>

<p>But in terms of div height, I thought setting it to a percentage (where there is no container) leaves the height dependent on content, as you had never specified a height. However, I set a div height to 100% and it seems to have a predetermined height. I'll post the code.</p>

This report includes an image that should only be seen by the user, so it needs to be invisible to other users.  Unfortunately, the various security methods I've looked into don't seem suited to my needs.</p>

<p>First, having the image just sitting in a folder would make it visible to other users.  Randomizing the image name (assuming the user can't get a directory listing) is better, but it doesn't sit well with me.  But maybe I'm just being paranoid...</p>

<p>Second, having the image outside of the web area and using a server side script to stream its content into a Data URI works great, but older versions of IE (on XP) cannot handle Data URIs > 32KB, and these images can be much larger than that.</p>

<p>Third, setting up user protection in folders via IIS/htaccess and putting the images there could work, but I've already set up security via a branded login page with row security.  Re-structing my security is more disruption than I'd like, and I'd need to ensure I can brand the login. </p>

Yesterday I updated sonarqube to its last version, 4.5.2, but now I'm facing intermittent failures when I issue a ""mvn sonar:sonar"" during my build process. That is, sometimes the whole build works as expected, but most of the attempts fail with errors like this:</p>

<pre><code>build   10-Jan-2015 16:50:57    [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.codehaus.mojo:sonar-maven-plugin:2.4:sonar (default-cli) on project project-parent: Unable to request: /batch/project?key=br.com.codersapiens:project-parent&amp;preview=false: Read timed out -&gt; [Help 1]
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that my CI server is not properly sized for the tools I use (basically, Bamboo and Sonarqube):</p>

<pre><code>apps@ubuntu12:~# uptime 
 16:50:01 up 172 days, 19:22,  2 users,  load average: 2.55, 2.06, 1.56

<p>This virtual machine has only one virtual processor:</p>

<pre><code>apps@ubuntu12:~# cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep ""model name""
model name  : Intel Core Processor (Haswell)
</code></pre>

<p>Regardless the high load for this modest VM, the build used to finish properly, with complete sonar analysis, when I was using qube's version 4.2.</p>

<p>Is this new version of sonarqube less tolerant to eventual delays caused by a busy host? Is there some way of setting this read timeout to bigger values? </p>

<p>About ""current speed"": I'm getting a callback every second or so telling me what my current latitude and longitude are.  I can calc the distance between the current location and the previous location, so, I can keep track of cumulative distance and cumulative.  With that I can say what the average speed has been for the ENTIRE trip.   But how do I calc current speed?  I suspect I need to use the most recent N samples, right?  Am I thinking about this the right way?  What's a good rule of thumb for N?  (how many samples, or how many seconds back?)</p>

<p>About ""stop time"":  If I'm just standing still, I can still get slightly different latitudes and longitudes reported to me, right?  So, deciding that I'm not really moving means saying something like, ""the previous X locs have all been within Y meters of each other"", right?  Am I thinking about this the right way?  What's a good rule of thumb for X and Y?</p>

<p>Even about ""distance"": will I be understating it because I'm, literally, cutting corners?  Is there an algorithm, a rule of thumb, for determining when I'm ""turning"" and should I add in a little fudge?</p>

<p>EDIT:  I APOLOGIZE: I feel bad about wasting people's time and good will, but sadly, the device <em>IS</em> giving me speed.  I thought it wasn't because in the emulator it wasn't, but on the real device it is.  Thanks everybody.   There's still some rule-of-thumb code I need to write, but speed was the biggest challenge.</p>

<p>EDIT: I retract the apology.  In my original question I wrote that distance too is a derived value.  If I just use the raw GPS data, I will be overstating distance because of the inaccuracies.  I might be walking a straight line, but the raw GPS lat/long will wobble, so if I calc total distance by measuring the distance between the points, I will be overstating it.  Here's some links that are related to this problem.</p>

<pre><code>public static function setupEnv()
        {
            $os = 'UNIX';
            if (stristr(PHP_OS,'WIN'))
            {
                $os = 'WIN';
            }

            if (!defined('DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR'))
            {
                define('DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR',($os == 'UNIX') ? '/' : '\\');

            }
            define('DS', \DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR);

            if (!defined('PATH_SEPARATOR'))
            {
                define('PATH_SEPARATOR', ($os == 'UNIX') ? ':' : ';');
            }
            define('PS', \PATH_SEPARATOR);

            if (!defined('APP_PATH'))
            {
                define('APP_PATH', dirname(dirname(__FILE__)));
                define('AP', APP_PATH);
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>The constants get defined properly, both <code>DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR</code> and <code>DS</code> and if I echo them here they work just fine.  The namespace for this is Feather\App.  In the <code>Autoloader</code> class, I use the <code>DS</code> constant and it works fine just.  The <code>Autoloader</code> class is in the same Feather\App namespace.</p>

<p>I am running PHPUnit, and created this test - <code>setupEnv()</code> is called in the <code>setUp()</code> function of PHPUnit:</p>

<pre><code>public function testAutoloadFunction()
    {
        $this-&gt;assertEquals(
            dirname(dirname(__FILE__)) . DS.'Components'.DS.'Collections'.DS.'Collection.php',
            \Feather\App\Autoloader::Autoload('\\Feather\\Components\\Collections\\Collection')
        );
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This fails the test, even though the path comes back correctly.  It says:</p>

<p><code>Use of undefined constant DS - assumed 'DS'</code></p>

<p>So that's a lot of backstory to get to my question - why is that an error?  I thought, OK, maybe I need to reference \Feather\App\DS, but that throws this:</p>

<p><code>PHP Fatal error: Undefined constant 'Feather\App\DS' in /web/Feather/Tests/AutoloaderTest.php</code></p>

<p>I thought that constants were defined in the global scope, so shouldn't this work?  If not, how do I make this work so that PHPUnit is happy?  If I put <code>use Feather\App</code> at the top, it still fails with the same <code>assumed 'DS'</code> error.</p>

<p>Can someone explain this?  The PHP documentation has been thus far unhelpful!</p>

<p>Right now I am having some issues with a session variable I am passing from my a php page my ajax is calling.</p>

<p>This is the last thing my getfields.php page does </p>

<pre><code>//Code to get information from database

//Loop to populate $column_array

$_SESSION['columnarray']=$column_array;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in my main page I use</p>

<pre><code>$(document).on('click', '#submit-button', function(e){
    &lt;?php
        $column_array = $_SESSION['columnarray'];
    ?&gt;

    if($('#checkbox'+elem).prop('checked'))
    {
        alert(elem)
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>So that when I click submit it alerts me to which checkboxes were chosen. The whole point of what I'm trying to do is not have to hardcode any variables from the database at all.</p>

<p>I have 4 buttons each for a different table in my database on my page which dynamically loads checkboxes specific to the table selected. The getfields.php run every time a different table is selected which successfully updates the main page. </p>

<p>When I click the submit button it will alert me for all the checkboxes I have selected but if I change the table selected and click the submit button then nothing happens.  I have to reselect the first table I originally selected to have the alerts come through successfully.</p>

<p>I have 4 different $(document).on functions.  One for each different table until I get around to making that all work in one function.</p>

<p>I did try the following to try and catch all 4 different submit buttons at once</p>

<pre><code>$(document).on('click', $('.submit-table'), function()....

<p>But that alerted me every time I clicked anywhere on the page and still only worked for the first table selected.</p>

<p>You can test it here: <a href=""http://eurokos.lt/under20/button.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eurokos.lt/under20/button.php</a> (Click 21 button, then try to enter any value and see what happens)</p>

<p>For this pop-up box I've used function:</p>

<pre><code>function popUp() {
    document.getElementById('light').style.display='block';
    document.getElementById('fade').style.display='block';
}
</code></pre>

<p>This function is used for X button to close window:</p>

<pre><code>function closeWindow() {
    document.getElementById('light').style.display='none';
    document.getElementById('fade').style.display='none';
}
</code></pre>

<p>My button which open pop-up window looks like:</p>

<p><code>Echo ""&lt;input type='button' onclick='popUp();' value='"".$i.""' /&gt;"";</code></p>

<p>And here is PHP_SELF and form:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
if(isset($_POST['submit'])) 
{ 
    $name = $_POST['name'];
    echo ""&lt;/br&gt;You have entered: &lt;b&gt; $name &lt;/b&gt;"";

}

<p>What I need to do that posted result what entered and window not closed? 
Maybe I need to use popUp() function again when submitting? But how to do that correctly? Thank you.</p>

I started by building a background (Cocos2D) and am able to add Sprites (using SpriteSheets, and TexturePacker) and animate those with use of plists. I wonder if it is possible to add sound-effects in the plist. For example: one of the Sprites has an animation ""screaming"". It would be very nice if the corresponding sound was incorporated in the plist! This also enables the animations and sounds being created by the more artistic people.
My experience is to small to write this code all by myself.</p>

<p>So i started looking at it and the logs show that I don't even get as far as the server. It turns out that the .NET framework method, which throws an exception (System.Net.BasicClient.EncodingRightGetBytes(String rawString)) doesn't like the british pound sign (£).</p>

<p>I copied the method from the reflector and wrote a quick unit test and pound is the only character that it doesnt like from all I could type on a keyboard:</p>

<pre><code>    internal static byte[] EncodingRightGetBytes(string rawString)
    {
            byte[] bytes = Encoding.Default.GetBytes(rawString);
            string strB = Encoding.Default.GetString(bytes);

            if (string.Compare(rawString, strB, StringComparison.Ordinal) != 0)
        {
            throw ExceptionHelper.MethodNotSupportedException;
        }
        return bytes;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is my unit test to check this method:</p>

<pre><code>[Test]
public void test123()
{
       string domain = ""localhost"";
       string userName = ""lukk"";

       string charactersToCheck = @""¬`!£$%^&amp;*()_+={}[]:;@'~#&lt;&gt;,.?/|\"";

       foreach (var character in charactersToCheck.ToCharArray())
       {
              string internalGetPassword = character.ToString();

              try
              {
                     // begin - this assignement was copied from System.Net.BasicClient.Lookup method
                     byte[] inArray = EncodingRightGetBytes(
                           (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(domain) ? (domain + @""\"") : """")
                           + userName
                           + "":""
                           + internalGetPassword);
                     //end
              }
              catch (Exception ex)
              {
                     Console.WriteLine(string.Format(""this character is bad: {0}"", internalGetPassword));
              }
       }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see EncodingRightGetBytes compares two strings and they are different if the original string (rawString) contains british pound.</p>

<p>EncodingRightGetBytes works fine when I replace the “Encoding.Default.” with “Encoding.UTF8.”…</p>

<p>Googling this method name brings back very few links, one of them being this:
<a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943511"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943511</a></p>

<p>I am using VS 2010 with an asp.net project set to use .net 3.5.</p>

<p>So would that be a bug in the .NET framework or am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>Edit:
When I query the Encoding.Default in the Immediate window while running my test I get this:</p>

I would like to include these files in my project, making them ""native"" to make the project independent of external files. I don't know where to add the files into the project or how to add them so they can easily be used by the appropriate method.</p>

<p>Searching on Google has not turned up any solid guidance, nor have I found any similar questions on this site. If someone knows how to do add files and where they should go, I'd greatly appreciate any advice or even a point in the right direction. Also, if any additional information about the code or the .txt files is required, I'll be happy to provide as much detail as possible.</p>

<p>UPDATE 5/20/2013: I've managed to get the text files into the classpath; they're located in a package under a folder called 'resc' (per dharam's advice), which is on the same classpath level as the 'src' folder in which my code is packaged. Now I just need to figure out how to get my code to read these files properly. Specifically, I want to read a selected file into a two-dimensional array, reading line-by-line and splitting each line by a delimiter. Prior to packaging the files directly within the workspace, I used a BufferedReader to do this:</p>

<pre><code>public static List&lt;String[]&gt; fileRead(String d) {
    // Initialize File 'f' with path completed by passed-in String 'd'.
    File f = new File(""&lt;incomplete directory path goes here&gt;"" + d);

    // Initialize some variables to be used shortly.
    String s = null;
    List&lt;String&gt; a = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
    List&lt;String[]&gt; l = new ArrayList&lt;String[]&gt;();

    try {
        // Use new BufferedReader 'in' to read in 'f'.
        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(f));

        // Read the first line into String 's'. 
        s = in.readLine();

        // So long as 's' is NOT null...
        while(s != null) {
            // Split the current line, using semi-colons as delimiters, and store in 'a'.
            // Convert 'a' to array 'aSplit', then add 'aSplit' to 'l'.
            a = Arrays.asList(s.split(""\\s*;\\s*""));
            String[] aSplit = a.toArray(new String[2]);
            l.add(aSplit);

            // Read next line of 'f'.
            s = in.readLine();
        }

        // Once finished, close 'in'.
        in.close();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // If problems occur during 'try' code, catch exception and include StackTrace.
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    // Return value of 'l'.
    return l;
}

<p>If I decide to use the methods described in the link provided by Pangea (using getResourceAsStream to read in the file as an InputStream), I'm not sure how I would be able to achieve the same results. Would someone be able to help me find a solution on this same question, or should I ask about that issue into a different question to prevent headaches?</p>

I am trying to implement a scrolling table in which I build its rows, cells, and fill its content programmatically in a specific format.  I have it scrolling, have built the rows/cells, and have filled it with dummy content for now, but I need some help <strong>formatting</strong> it to suit my needs.</p>

<p><strong>I need to format it in the following way:</strong></p>

<p>Overall, it will be a 9 wide x 60 long table in which the 1st column is all headers and the next 8 cells in the row will be data.  This pattern will continue for 60 rows.</p>

<p>I would like the first column (left most column) to be all table headers <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> of memory addresses counting in multiples of 8 in hex (i.e. 00, 08, 10, 18, 20, ...) all the way up to 300 base 16 or (768 decimal). I would also like to divide each block of twenty rows in the table with an additional row that spans accross all 9 cells to just break it up into block 1, block 2, and block 3 sections (this would change the dimensions of the table to 9x63).</p>

<p><strong>Here is what I have so far:</strong></p>

<p><strong>HTML: Set up the div and table</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""scrollingDiv""&gt;
    &lt;table id=""contentTable"" border=""1""&gt;
        &lt;!-- Fill table programmatically --&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>CSS: Setting the div up to scroll</strong></p>

<pre><code>#scrollingDiv
{
    border: 2px groove black;
    height: 350px;
    width: 350px;
    background: #787878;
    overflow: auto;
}

#contentTable
{
    height: 350px;
    width: 350px;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Javascript: Building the table and filling it with dummy data</strong></p>

<pre><code>function buildTable()
{
    var memoryTable =document.getElementById(""contentTable"");

    var rows = new Array();
    var cells = new Array();

    for( var i = 0; i &lt; 60; i++ )
    {
        rows[i]  = memoryTable.insertRow(i);

        for( var x = 0; x &lt; 9; x++ )
        {
            if( x === 0) // Create header cell with memory address
            {
                cells[rows.length - 1] = rows[rows.length - 1].insertCell(x);
                cells[rows.length - 1].innerHTML = ""00"".bold(); // how to center this also
            }
            else // Create 8 content cells

<p>Besides, users should be able to register themselfs (Devise Registerable).</p>

<p>I have a User controller, using devise_for :users and resources :users .</p>

<p>I can sign_up users, since I used the :registerable, flag in my Users model.</p>

<p>What I want to do now is to add the ability for admins to create users.</p>

<p>If I used the described system, I always get the message 'You are already signed in' when creating a new user through /users/new as admin. This is a message from devise.</p>

<p>So I followed the tutorial www.tonyamoyal.com/2010/07/28/rails-authentication-with-devise-and-cancan-customizing-devise-controllers/ to use cancan to restrict some actions and created a own devise registrations controller like described there.</p>

<p>My cancan ability model looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>if user.has_role?(:admin)
  #admin
  can :manage, :all
elsif !(user.new_record?)
  #logged in but no admin
   ...
else
  # Guest
  can :create, User
end
</code></pre>

<p>and my registrations controller like in the tutorial</p>

<pre><code>class RegistrationsController &lt; Devise::RegistrationsController
  before_filter :check_permissions, :only =&gt; [:new, :create, :cancel]
  skip_before_filter :require_no_authentication

  def check_permissions
    authorize! :create, resource
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I also added the controller to the routes.rb</p>

<p>With this I can create new users with the admin, but if I want to sign_up as not logged in user (""#Guest"") I get always the message cancan exception ""Access denied"". And if I call exception.subject in the CanCan exception handling it is empty.</p>

<p>Can it be, that 'resource' from my controller is not initialized? How can I get the expected behaviour?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your help ;-)</p>

<p>I'm using the GmailApp.sendEmail() method in Google Apps.</p>

<p>The account e-mail address is a non-plus (obviously) address, but I use several plus addresses to filter messages into categories.</p>

<p>When I send a message with sendEmail(), it uses the main account address and it does not appear that there is a way to change this for a script.</p>

<p>While I can set the ""name"" for the account, I'd like to set the from address to a plus version of the account address.</p>

<p>(I remember running into this same issue with the Calendar user interface.)</p>

<p>So, I also tried setting a replyTo address using the advanced parameters. (This is not the way I'd prefer to do it.)</p>

<p>The replyTo parameter obviously accepts the address and the message that is sent contains the reply-to header. I've include the header lines below with 'example' replacing the account address.</p>

<pre><code>Delivered-To: example+test@gmail.com

Reply-To: Richard Michael &lt;example+pch@gmail.com&gt;

From: Richard Michael &lt;example@gmail.com&gt;
To: example+test@gmail.com
</code></pre>

<p>When I use the Reply button in Gmail, however, the 'To' address that loads in the form is example+test@gmail.com which is neither of the possibilities I would expect. (It should be the Reply-to or, at worst, the From address.) The From address in the reply form is example@gmail.com, which is expected (but also the reason I want to 'send' from a plus address).</p>

<p>I've repeated this several times with the same result.</p>

<p>Of course, Gmail also allows you to 'send' from foreign accounts as well in the user interface after you've performed a validation check. So, you can't send from those addresses either.</p>

<p>Obviously the iframe is a separate page to the main page, and this is the cause of the problem. </p>

<p>Update: 01/11/12</p>

<p>I am trying to draw the shortest path route, attaining this by traversing each nodes by the said algorithm and compare the distances of the nodes traversed to find the shortest path. Another problem is that I cannot find the right A* search implementation in Android/Java. My problem right now are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Since I will save the geopoint(nodes) of each intersection of the roads, like should i store it on array or link list? </p></li>
<li><p>Right now we were able to calculate the distance of each node but not dynamically. What should I do to use this in calculating for the shortest route using A* search. </p></li>

Have seen some post from Qt stating that they will be transitioning most things to QML eventually, so this seems like it may be the way to go, at least according to Qt.</p>

<p>Edit: I realize that QML probably wouldn't be the best bet for a 3D game with heavy graphics.  Was looking more for something that did mostly 2D stuff like a platformer type game.</p>

<p>Seen this <a href=""http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2010/08/12/a-guide-to-writing-games-with-qml/"">http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2010/08/12/a-guide-to-writing-games-with-qml/</a>.  So its obviously possible to some extent.  I have also seen some impressive games made solely with java script, which I believe is the base of QML.

Passing the input straight through works fine, but passing it through <code>MultiJson.encode</code> is what's causing the problem.</p>

<p>I'm sending the following up to a restful web service via curl:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -v -X POST ""http://my/url"" -d ""{\""body\"": \""💳\""}""
</code></pre>

<p>The character that you probably can't see is the <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/~scherer/emoji4unicode/20090804/utc.html#e-4E1"" rel=""nofollow"">Credit Card</a> emoji character, which is U+1F4B3.</p>

<p>The response I get back from the service is essentially:</p>

<pre><code>&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; Date: Wed, 30 Oct 2013 02:38:04 GMT
&lt; Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
&lt; Content-Length: 266
&lt; Connection: close
&lt; 
{ [data not shown]
100   304  100   266  100    38    936    133 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   936
* Closing connection 0
{
  ""body"": ""\uf4b3""
}
</code></pre>

<p>This encoded character does not correspond to what I sent and I would expect it to be returned as sent (in this case).</p>

<p>I have access to the server's source code. It's built on Ruby, Sinatra and ActiveRecord. There is some amount of processing going on before the response is sent:</p>

<ul>
<li>First the content is passed through <code>ERB::Util.html_escape</code></li>
<li>Then, a series of regexs are applied via <code>str.gsub!(reg, "" ### "")</code></li>
<li>Finally, the response is returned via <code>MultiJson.encode</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not a Ruby person, but can provide additional details if necessary. Would appreciate someone pointing me in the right direction. Thanks!</p>

<p>""5"" and ""6"" are both item IDs and unique in the file. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I want to create a matrix demonstrating how many times in the document each attribute was mentioned in the same row with every other attribute. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>        peaty    sweet    cereal    cream    barley ...

<p>Note that I'd prefer to reduce duplicates: i.e., ""peaty"" isn't both a column and a row.</p>

<p>The original database is essentially a key-value store (A table with columns ""itemId"" and ""value"") -- I can reformat the data if it helps.</p>

<p>Any idea how I'd do this with Python, PHP or Ruby (Whichever is easiest)? I get the feeling Python can probably do this the easiest of the bunch but I'm missing something fairly basic and/or crucial (I'm just starting to do data analysis with Python).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In response to the (somewhat unhelpful) ""What have you tried"" comment, here's what I'm currently working with (Don't laugh, my Python is terrible):</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
import csv

matrix = {}

with open(""field.csv"", ""rb"") as csvfile:
    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in csvreader:
        attribs = row[1].split(""|"")
        for attrib in attribs:
            if attrib not in matrix:
                matrix[attrib] = {}
            for attrib2 in attribs:
                if attrib2 in matrix[attrib]:
                    matrix[attrib][attrib2] = matrix[attrib][attrib2] + 1 
                else:
                    matrix[attrib][attrib2] = 1
print matrix 
</code></pre>

<p>The output is a big, unsorted dictionary of terms, likely with a lot of duplication between the rows and columns. If I use pandas and replace the ""print matrix"" line with the following...</p>

<pre><code>from pandas import *
df = DataFrame(matrix).T.fillna(0)
print df
</code></pre>

<p>I get:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;

<pre><code>C:\ProgramData\&lt;Application Name&gt;\ or
C:\Users\&lt;Username&gt;\AppData\
C:\Windows\System32\ or
C:\Windows\
</code></pre>

<p>I want to know how to write a code which checks if the dll is present in any of the above location and then uses it. like:</p>

<pre><code>string sPath = """";
if(File.Exist(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ProgramFiles) + ""\\&lt;Application Name&gt;""\\itextsharp.dll""))
  sPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ProgramFiles) + ""\\&lt;Application Name&gt;""\\itextsharp.dll"");

  sPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData) + ""\\&lt;Application Name&gt;""\\itextsharp.dll"");
</code></pre>

<p>.... and so on.....</p>

<p>and then how to use the <code>sPath</code> variable to access the library and its namespace and classes.</p>

<p>I want it this way because the file is not always in a specific folder and I do not want to keep all code related files in the main Program files folder: <code>""C:\Program Files\&lt;Application Name&gt;\""</code>  If the file already present in any of the above location then prefer to use that first. So if I add a .NET library using ""add reference"", then is it a fixed path? I need to first find the correct path and then instruct code to use it and access it namespace and classes.</p>

<p>My second question is that if I add a .NET dll from a location using ""add reference"", then should the path be exactly same when it is deployed on client's machine? For example if my windows drive is C: and I use path <code>""C:\Users\&lt;Username&gt;\AppData\itextsharp.dll""</code> but if client has Windows installed in D: drive, then will the code access path from C drive or D drive? And how to change the path programmatically?</p>

When I started my game first, I got around 350 fps. After I added a heightmap and some more code to the program, is it logical that the fps drop. Now I got 39 fps.
I'm still at the beginning and the fps is already low. I wonder what happens when I finish the project, I think the fps will be so low that it's irritating.
I know that I'm asking very much of the program, the heightmap is the big problem.
The map has an area of 200 * 200 vertices, each vertice has a height.
200 * 200 = 40000 vertices, each frame.
I was thinking to simplify the map. My idea is to create a method which simplifies the whole heightmap. Each 4 vertices belong to a quad. When there are two or more quads next to each other which have the same height on each vertex, they can be merged to one quad.
The point is that there should be less vertices. (I think)</p>

At the same time, I'm beginning to look into the Boost library, and have noticed the <code>BOOST_SCOPE_EXIT</code> macro (the <a href=""http://www.boost.org/libs/scope_exit"" rel=""nofollow"">Boost.ScopeExit library</a>).</p>

<p>These two seem to be quite different implementation-wise (<code>BOOST_SCOPE_EXIT</code> uses <code>Boost.TypeOf</code>, nothing like that in ScopeGuard11's <code>SCOPE_EXIT</code>); and the Boost macro is concerned with parameter capture etc. which is less of an issue in C++11; but beyond that, they seem to offer essentially the same functionality.</p>

<p>Am I right or am I missing something? Could one say that ScopeGuard11 is a 'cleaner' mechanism with the same functionality of Boost.ScopeGuard but with less backwards compatibility?</p>

<p>However, due to the way the plugin system is structured (plugins go into a twisted/plugins directory which should <em>not</em> be a Python package), writing a proper setup.py for installing those plugins appears to be non-trivial.</p>

<p>I've seen some attempts that add 'twisted.plugins' to the 'packages' key of the distutils setup command, but since it is not really a package, bad things happen (for example, an <code>__init__.py</code> is helpfully added by some tools).</p>

<p>Other attempts seem to use 'package_data' instead (eg, <a href=""http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~glyph/divmod.org/trunk/view/head:/Epsilon/epsilon/setuphelper.py"">http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~glyph/divmod.org/trunk/view/head:/Epsilon/epsilon/setuphelper.py</a>), but that can also fail in weird ways.</p>

"16479496","1","","","2013-05-10 09:48:06","","1","118","<p>I tried to make a who owes who script in <code>PHP</code>, but it's really harder to put in code than i thought.</p>

<p>I have made an example of 5 people below:</p>

<pre><code>Person  Paid    Owes/Receivables
A       480     -26
B       600     94
C       1200    694
D       250     -256
E       0       -506
TOTAL   2530    
Average owe per person = 506    
</code></pre>

<p>What i am trying to achieve, is a script that prints out how much each person owes, and to whom. My first approach was to split the people who owed money up in an <code>array</code>, and the same with the people who needs to get paid in another <code>array</code>. I am very confused with this approach still, so i can't really explain what I would do afterwards.</p>

<p>This is my rules of the script:</p>

<ul>
<li>Arrange the values of the <code>arrays</code> with the highest first.</li>
<li>Subtract the highest from receivable with the highest from owes array.</li>
<li>If the receivables value is still positive, move on to the next value in owes array.</li>
<li>If now the receivables value is negative do following: Take the negative value and subtract it from the original owed, then subtract it from the value on the receivable array (will be 0 on the value then). Move on to the next on the receivable array. </li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure if this makes any sense or not. I am just hoping that someone can clarify this. </p>

<p>I've made 2 arrays and I thought maybe a while or a foreach loop with the values and if sentences could do it, but I am pretty confused at this point.</p>

"11984816","1","11985496","","2012-08-16 10:00:33","","0","633","<p>I have code to define behavior of a position model set in a world file for stageros. I want to keep track of it's current position in the world in the variables <code>px</code> <code>py</code> and <code>ptheta</code> by subscribing to the <code>odom</code> topic for Odometry messages sent by stageros. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>ros::Subscriber RobotOdometry_sub = n.subscribe&lt;nav_msgs::Odometry&gt;(""robot_0/odom"",1000,&amp;Robot::ReceiveOdometry,this);
</code></pre>

<p>Which is put in the constructor for a Robot object. Then the callback is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>void Robot::ReceiveOdometry(nav_msgs::Odometry msg)
{
    //This is the call back function to process odometry messages coming from Stage.
    px = initialX + msg.pose.pose.position.x;
    py = initialY + msg.pose.pose.position.y;
    ptheta = angles::normalize_angle_positive(asin(msg.pose.pose.orientation.z) * 2);
    ROS_INFO(""x odom %f y odom %f theta %f"", px, py, ptheta);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This callback seems to get called no problem. The px, py and ptheta values printed by the callback are all correct as well and correspond with their current position in the world. The problem occurs in other functions:</p>

<pre><code>void Robot::OtherFunction() {
    while (ros::ok())
    {
        ros::spinOnce();
        ROS_INFO(""x %f y %f theta %f"", px, py, ptheta);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is just an example, but for some reason the px, py and ptheta values printed from another function always seem to be stuck at the initial px, py and ptheta values. Even though the ReceiveOdometry callback is continuously printing the right values as well. The px, py, ptheta values are different as if there are two different values for each variable.</p>

<p>ROS_INFO from ReceiveOdometry prints the current position correctly.</p>

<p>ROS_INFO from OtherFunction prints the initial positions and doesn't change at all even though px, py and ptheta are continuously being set in ReceiveOdometry.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what is causing the changes to px, py and ptheta in the ReceiveOdometry callback not to carry over to the OtherFunction? Hopefully this question makes sense.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>As you can see calling a protected variable with either parent class or subclass is throwing error . So what I can assume is: do something like, <em>$prot acts like private modifier in parent class and we are not allowed to call it from outside the class block .</em> and <em>$prot variable when inherited into subclass it starts acting like <strong>private variable</strong> because even now it wasn't allowed to call it from outside .</em>

But it must be displayed in such a way that the user can only see the first 100 records and with a navigation link or button he can go to another page where, he can see the next 100 records.</p>

<p>For instance the user should have the following options available for navigation:
<code>First page</code>, <code>Previous page</code>, <code>Next page</code>, <code>Last page</code></p>

<p>With the <code>First page</code> - the user can navigate and view the first 100 records.</p>

<p><code>Previous page</code> - view the previous 100 records</p>

<p><code>Next page</code>  - view next 100 records</p>

<p><code>Last page</code>  - view last 100 records</p>

<p>I am not a 100% sure how to go about this. I thought of embedding other HTML pages within another that hold each set of 100 records, but sounds oddly wrong. I also thought about a sql query that for the first page it chooses the top 100 records and when a user press <code>Next page</code>, the query adjust and checks the current records/position and choose the next 100 records, which sounds like a viable option. But can someone give a few tips or examples, just so i can get some kind of reference that can help me on where to start. </p>

p t + 1
p 1 + t

p t + [3 , 4 , 5]
p [3 , 4 , 5] + t

<p>Clearly coerce is doing its job when adding numbers but doesn't seem to work for Arrays. Instead the + method on the Array class seems to get called and it tries to convert MyVector to Array, which fails.  My question is, why does the coerce method for MyVector not get called ? </p>

<p>Let's take a simple example, in which I want only tick marks at the limits:</p>

<pre><code>A = 1; f = 5; p = 0; d = 0.4
t = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 0.01)

x = A * sin(t * f + p) * exp(-d * t)
numticks = 1

qplot(x = t, y = x) + theme_classic() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::trans_breaks(""identity"", function(x) x, n=numticks) )
</code></pre>

<p>This looks great (see below), but ideally I would be able to produce the same result without using <code>scale_x_continuous</code> as it's clunky. I want to replace <code>theme_classic()</code> with <code>+ mytheme</code> and that should solve it.</p>

<p>Here's my best attempt so far at a solution:</p>

<pre><code>mytheme &lt;- theme_classic() + 
theme(scale_x_continuous(breaks=trans_breaks(""identity"", function(x) x, n=numticks)) 
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure if this is even possible, and happy to keep typing <code>scale_x_continuous(...)</code> every time. But it would be even better to change the defaults temporarily or, even better, in a custom theme.</p>

<p>Here's the plot axes I want to produce btw, and I want to produce many such plots (for plotting <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonograph"" rel=""nofollow"">harmonographs</a>):</p>

<p>I need to catch every argument passed to a specific method call <code>_n(</code> and <code>_(</code>. For example, if I have these in my javascript files:</p>

<pre><code>_(""foo"") // want ""foo""
_n(""bar"", ""baz"", 42); // want ""bar"", ""baz"", 42
_n(domain, ""bux"", var); // want domain, ""bux"", var
_( ""one (optional)"" ); // want ""one (optional)""

<p>This refs this documentation: <a href=""http://poedit.net/trac/wiki/Doc/Keywords"" rel=""nofollow"">http://poedit.net/trac/wiki/Doc/Keywords</a></p>

<p>I'm planning in doing it in two times (and two regex):</p>

<ol>
<li>catch all function arguments for <code>_n(</code> or <code>_(</code> method calls</li>
<li>catch the stringy ones only</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically, I'd like a Regex that could say ""catch everything after <code>_n(</code> or <code>_(</code> and stop <em>at the last parenthesis <code>)</code> actually when the function is done</em>. I dunno if it is possible with regex and without a javascript parser.</p>

<p>What could also be done is ""catch every ""string"" or 'string' after <code>_n(</code> or <code>_(</code> and stop at the end of the line OR at the beginning of a new <code>_n(</code> or <code>_(</code> character.</p>

<p>In everything I've done I get either stuck on <code>_( ""one (optional)"" );</code> with its inside parenthesis or <code>apples === 0 ? _( ""No apples"" ) : _n(""%1 apple"", ""%1 apples"", apples)</code> with two calls on the same line.</p>

For example, there is a field named ""tweetID"", it should be a string of figures, like ""23465478"". After export a collection into a csv file, I found that for some entries the tweetID are exported as decimal type, like ""254323467.0"", while some entries are not. To avoid unnecessary mistakes, I just want to export all the fields in pure string type. Anyone knows how to set this in command mongoexport? Thanks in advance.</p>

My question is is it possible in java to just simply open a jar file like any other file (using buffered reader/writer), read it's contents, and write them somewhere else? For example:</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.*;

public class zipReader {

public static void main(String[] args){

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader((System.getProperty(""user.home"").replaceAll(""\\\\"", ""/"") + ""/Desktop/foo.zip"")));
    BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter((System.getProperty(""user.home"").replaceAll(""\\\\"", ""/"") + ""/Desktop/baf.zip"")));
    char[] ch = new char[180000];

    while(br.read(ch) &gt; 0){

        bw.write(ch);
        bw.flush();

    }

    br.close();
    bw.close();

}

}
</code></pre>

<p>This works on some small zip/jar files, but most of the time will just corrupt them making it impossible to unzip or execute them. I have found that setting the size of the char[] to 1 will not corrupt the file, just everything in it, meaning I can open the file in an archive program but all it's entries will be corrupted and unusable. Does anyone know how to write the above code so it won't corrupt the file? Also here is a line from a jar file I tested this on that became corrupted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>nèñà?G¾Þ§<code>V</code>¨ö—‚?‰9³’?ÀM·p›a0„èwåÕüaEÜµp‡aæOùR‰(JºJ´êgžè*?”6ftöãÝÈ—ê@qïc3âi,áž…¹¿Êð)V¢cã>Ê”G˜(†®9öCçM?€ÔÙÆC†ÑÝ×ok?ý—¥úûFs.‡</p>

<p>vs the original:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As you can see either the reader or writer adds ?'s into the files and I can't figure out why. Again I don't want any answers telling me to open it entry by entry, I already know how to do that, if anyone knows the answer to my question please share it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Client connects to node server through socket.io, sends his SID</li>
<li>Redis verifies if said SID is in its store, if not, don't emit 'authenticated', if the sid is in the store, then emit 'authenticated'</li>
<li>Upon receiving the authentication, the extra options are given</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds pretty straightforward, and it should be. However this happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>Client connects with a SID thats in the redis store</li>
<li>Node.js server verifies that the SID is in the store but fails to emit said 'authenticated'</li>
</ul>

<p>However, when i restart the node server, everything seems to work just fine :S. But when i proceed to remove the key from the store, and add it again (by ?auth and ?logout) the 'authenticated' is again not emitted.</p>

<p>Client code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
session_start();
header(""Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate""); // HTTP/1.1

require ""./libraries/Predis.php"";


if(isset($_GET['logout'])) {
    session_regenerate_id();
}

$sid =  sha1(session_id());
$redis = new Predis\Client();

echo ""&lt;h1&gt;SID: "" . $sid . ""&lt;/h1&gt;"";

if(isset($_GET['auth'])) {
    $redis-&gt;set($sid, mt_rand(1,20000));
    $redis-&gt;expire($sid, 1800);
    echo ""auth set&lt;br /&gt;"";

<p><strong>Option #1:</strong></p>

<p>I'm in the process of analyzing this data and I need to query for documents that were ""updated"" between a period.
i.e., I want to return all the objects that have been p (published) or an li.it (item) or co.it (item) added between '2014-07-01' and '2014-07-03'.</p>

<p>What would be the most performant way of doing this?</p>

<p><strong>Option #2:</strong></p>

<p>Another option that I'm evaluating is whether I want to add an 'u' property with an updated date to account for when the document was updated 
(ie., li or co item added)</p>

<p>If I make the change to the process to ensure new documents have this property, how would I iterate through existing documents and add this retroactively?</p>

<p>Would filtering on 'u' be more performant that Option 1?  I'm looking at this option as using COPY FROM JSON from a mongoexport</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JeHUB.png"" alt=""example drawing""></p>

<p>I am programatically adding buttons to this scrollview in a dynamically-varying for-loop.  There is a ""containerView"" that basically is the same width of the scrollview, and I'm actually adding the buttons directly onto that.  The code is pretty straight-forward there, something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i=0; i&lt;numberOfButtons; i++) {
    UIButton *currentButton = [[UIButton alloc] init];
    [currentButton setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints:NO];
    [currentButton setBackgroundImage:buttonImage forState:UIControlStateNormal];
    [currentButton setTag:i];
    [currentButton addTarget:self action:@selector(buttonPressed:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
    [self.containerView addSubview:currentButton];
    // here's where I programatically set constraints for positioning
}
</code></pre>

<p>The buttons show perfectly fine in the correct spots, and the ones initially on the screen (i.e. the first 2 in the screenshot example above) fire the ""buttonPressed:"" method perfectly fine.  However, the ones that are initially off-screen still show fine, but the event is not fired when tapped.</p>

<p>I see other similar posts to this out there, but nothing seems to work.  Any ideas on where to go on this one?  I'm a bit stumped.  Thanks in advance!</p>

To achieve this, we usually run a for-loop through 5 millions items in the worst case O(N) to access and change the states of the dot, according to the mouse coordinates (x, y).  Due to the huge number of the objects, this approach causes lots of overhead (we have to run the for-loop of five millions whenever a user selects a dot). I have already tested this approach but it was almost impossible to make an interactive tool with this. Is there anyway to rapidly and efficiently access the dots without running the million for-loop and causing this performance problem? </p>

Unfortunately I'm not able to find the correct answer to my problem.</p>

<p>First-off I'll be showing my Classes and App.config.</p>

<p><strong>Class: Form1 : Form</strong></p>

<pre><code>public partial class Form1 : Form
{
    Database db = new Database();

    public Form1()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        db.Test();
    }

    {
        db.MdfConnectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[""MDFConnection""].ConnectionString;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Class: Database</strong></p>

<pre><code>class Database
{
    private string _mdfConnectionString;

    public string MdfConnectionString
    {
        get { return this._mdfConnectionString; }
        set { this._mdfConnectionString = value; }
    }

    public void Test()
    {
        MessageBox.Show(_mdfConnectionString);
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>App.config</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;connectionStrings&gt;
      &lt;add name=""MDFConnection"" connectionString=""Data Source=(LocalDB)\v11.0;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|Database\AutoFill.mdf;Integrated Security=True;ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly"" providerName=""System.Data.SqlClient"" /&gt;

        &lt;supportedRuntime version=""v4.0"" sku="".NETFramework,Version=v4.5"" /&gt;
    &lt;/startup&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In my Class <strong>Database.cs</strong> I've got an <strong>MessageBox.Show(_mdfConnectionString);</strong> that will show the private string ( backing field ) but, for some odd reason the <strong>_mdfConnectionString</strong> is always null.</p>

<p>I've declared on my Class <strong>Form1 : Form</strong> that it needs to load the connection string in my App.config.</p>

<p>Not forgetting to mention that <strong>ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[""MDFConnection""].ConnectionString;</strong> itself returns a value so that's not the issue here.</p>

<p>Hope somebody can help me on this problem.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong></p>

<p>Changed the code to make it more clear for people. Also the ExecuteQuery isn't important so I made a simple method in Database.cs Class calling a Message Box.</p>

<p>Also the Executable and Exe.config are inside the same folder while executing.</p>

<li><strong>CSS class naming:</strong> For now the our widgets' css naming is separated from the jquery UI theme (we don't use jquery UI's classes for titles / header and such). what are the pros &amp; cons of this approach?</li>

<li><strong>Less CSS</strong> i read about this script-like css approach. our system is medium-sized but growing by the day which could be unreadably complicated. should we migrate?</li>

<p>I have a left pane and a center pane. I dynamically generate div 
when the user clicks on the left pane. The divs are generated and 
dropped on the center pane. The divs are draggable and resizable. 
Everything works fine with dragging and resizing on the visible center 
area. The moment I drag the div beyond the bottom, the scroll bar on 
the center pane appears and it seems the center pane is extending to 
accommodate the new position of the dragged div. But the moment I try 
to resize the div or add another div, it jumps to the top section of 
the div and resets the scrollbars. I checked the center div height in 
firebug and it remains at the same height when initialized 
even after dragging the new div beyond the bottom.  </p>

<p>Here is the test page html code.</p>

<p>Just copy/paste entirely into a html page. On the left pane, click on the ""Add new"" button will add new div that is draggable and resizable. </p>

<ol>
<li>Click on ""Add new"" </li>
<li>Drag the newly added div beyond the bottom of the center pane. </li>
<li>The center pane shows the scrollbar as it is suppose to. </li>
<li>If you check the center div's height in firebug, it is not changing </li>

I have used the Google until my fingers have bled and I don't know how to keep the inner callback from continuing instead of recursing. The paging from the external API is required by the API to prevent a DDOS on the remote system in the case of large datasets that need to be fetched.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class=""cright"" id=""cat""&gt;
@{
    if (String.Compare(ViewBag.Message.Category, ""Technical"") == 0) 
    {
     Technical Problem &lt;----THIS  
    } 
    else @ViewBag.Message.Category
 }
&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>More info:
I'm working on a messaging system. Users create a message and as it is being sent they can view it. The category is compulsory (Question, Suggestion or Technical Problem) and to avoid redundancy in the database I truncate the last option to just 'Technical', however when the users view their sent message I want it to show up in full.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone; from all your answers I arrived at: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class=""cright"" id=""cat""&gt;

      @if (ViewBag.Message.Category == ""Technical "")
         {&lt;text&gt;Technical Problem&lt;/text&gt;}
       else
         {&lt;text&gt;@ViewBag.Message.Category&lt;/text&gt;}

&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which works just as I wanted. </p>

<p>I'm sorry I may have written this wrong. If there is only 1 SKU for a record, then I want to return the DaysDifference (if it's not null), if it has more than 1 record and they are not null, then return the average days difference. If it is all nulls, then at a vendor level check for the average of the skus that are not null, otherwise it should just return 7. This is what I have tried:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT t1.SKU, ISNULL
(
    AVG(t1.DaysDifference), 
    (
        SELECT ISNULL(AVG(t2.DaysDifference), 7)
        FROM @TmpTbl_SKUs t2
        WHERE t2.SKU=t1.SKU
        GROUP BY t2.ChampVendor, t2.VendorNumber, t2.SKU
    )
)
 FROM @TmpTbl_SKUs t1
 GROUP BY t1.SKU
</code></pre>

<p>Keep playing with this. I somewhat have what I got, but just don't understand how I would check if it has multiple records, and how to check at a vendor level.</p>

<p>I am trying to follow the examples <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/653714/how-to-select-into-temp-table-from-stored-procedure"">here</a>, which show how to create a new temporary table using a stored procedure as the source of the data. I am trying to combine the results of several stored procedures into a single temporary table (the column-structure/definition of the various resultsets is identical).</p>

<p>To test if the plumbing is working, I issue this query:</p>

<pre><code> SELECT * FROM OPENQUERY(""FOO\SQL2012"", 'exec mySchema.myStoredProc')
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm getting this error from that simple test-the-plumbing select query:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Msg 11526, Level 16, State 1, Procedure sp_describe_first_result_set, Line 1<br>
  The metadata could not be determined because statement 'insert #tmp(foo1, foo2, foo3)
  select 'O' as foo1, foo2, foo3' in procedure 'myStoredProc' uses a temp table.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I understand the error correctly, OPENQUERY depends upon the server being able to extract the column datatypes from the <em>persistent</em> definition in the database, and the temporary table instantiated in my stored proc, being ephemeral, lacks a persistent definition. If that is the case, <strong>is there any setting that tells OPENQUERY to do the best it can and try to make an intelligent guess at the column datatypes?</strong></p>

<p>Here's the dummy SP I'm testing with:</p>

<pre><code>create proc testproc
as
begin

create table #test
(id int, name varchar(5) );

insert into #test(id,name)values(1,'xxx');
select * from #test;
--drop table #test;   -- tried dropping and not dropping, same error either way

<p>You can visit the site: <a href=""http://bit.ly/XlzkXp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/XlzkXp</a></p>

<p>My template looks like: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/cd15e320be6f4454a7fb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/cd15e320be6f4454a7fb</a></p>

<p>I'm serving the template using a shortcut from the URL conf, no database usage at all: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/f9d1a9a191959dcff1b5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/f9d1a9a191959dcff1b5</a></p>

<p>However, it's consistently taking 15+ seconds for the response. New relic shows this is because of requests going to S3 while processing the view. This does not make any sense to me. </p>

<p>New Relic data: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/vs9ZTLP.png?1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/vs9ZTLP.png?1</a></p>

<p>Why is something using <code>httplib</code> to request things from S3? I can see how collectstatic might be doing it, but not the processing of the view itself. </p>

<p>What am I not understanding about Django-skel and this setup?</p>

<p>We tested the refactored version by doing a lot of request using data from our logs as parameters and compared the raw result of the old and refactored web service. The only difference we found was that the namespace of the result was in another order. Note that old and refactored web service were on different servers. Different order of the namespace seems safe to release so that was what we did...</p>

<p>Today I was contacted by a customer telling me that they were unable to read our result and pointing this namespace issue as the reason. This seems very strange to me since they must have a more or less corrupt XML parser to get an issue like this. I would however try to isolate this, since we loose a lot of money every hour.</p>

<p>I reverted our project back to .NET 3.5 but get the same namespace order. But there seems to be a difference of the namespace order between the servers.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why the order is different? Does it have to do with .NET version, version of other components or is it just random?</p>

The applications are using a variety of embedded databases (DBISAM and Jet currently, but this may change).</p>

<p>In the past I've done this with DBISAM using the user version numbers than can be stored with each table.  I shipped an extra, empty set of database files and, at start-up, compared the version numbers of each table using the FieldDefs to update the installed table if necessary.  While this worked I found it clumsy to have to ship a spare copy of the database and newer versions of DBISAM have changed the table restructuring methodology so that I'll need to rewrite this anyway.</p>

<p>I can see two ways of implementing this: storing a version number with the database and using DDL scripts to get from older versions to newer versions or storing a reference version of the database structure inside the application, comparing the reference to the database on start-up, and having the application generate DDL commands to upgrade the database.</p>

<p>I think that I'll probably have to implement parts of both.  I won't want the application to diff the database against the reference structure every time the application starts (too slow), so I'll need a database structure version number to detect whether the user is using an outdated structure.  However, I'm not sure I can trust pre-written scripts to do the structural upgrade when the database could have been partially updated in the past or when the user may have themselves changed the database structure, so I'm inclined to use a reference diff for the actual update.</p>

<p>Researching the question I've found a couple of database versioning tools but they all seem targeted towards SQL Server and are implemented outside the actual application.  I'm looking for a process that would be tightly integrated into my application and that could be adapted to different database requirements (I know that I'll have to write adapters, custom descendant classes, or event code to handle differences in DDL for various databases, that doesn't bother me).</p>

<p>Does anyone know of anything off the shelf that does this or failing that, does anyone have any thoughts on:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The best way to store a reference version of a generic relational database structure inside an application.</p></li>
<li><p>The best way to diff the reference against the actual database.</p></li>

In the past I used VS2008 and everything was fine, now I just switched to VS2012 and it seems I can't config to use any of additional source and library directories, always getting LNK2001 and LNK2019 errors even though they are exact configs as I did with VS2008.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I though images would help people checking if I set things up at the right place. VS2012 is quite confusing to me.</p>

<p>I have tried using Diluculum, here is my config in VS2012:

<p>I'm not sure if my configs are right for this version of Visual Studio. I tried to find a way myself but it was 4 days already without any process to run a simple source. It's so depressing.</p>

The chart allows you to expand and shrink nodes using the tree view, by clicking on the node in the tree hierarchy.</p>

<p>With respect to the issues I have encountered, there is a noticeable slowdown in brush scrolling over time, and I originally thought it was possible I was not removing nodes that I should be and it was causing the slow down, but I did spend time checking this issue and it doesn't seem to be the case. It doesn't yet support clipping and the activity bars in the chart overlap with the tree grid when you scroll the brush. It seems to slow down, and is a bit slow in firefox, but if you shrink and expand the top level node in the tree grid view, scrolling of the tree brush becomes faster again.</p>

<p>I need assistance with the following issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>clipping; I'm not sure how to modify the code to make this work.</li>
<li>delayed scrolling of the chart view when the brush is used, so the brush doesn't call update on every move.</li>
<li>some guidance on how I can resolve the slow down that occurs over time when the brush is used.</li>

</code></pre>

<p>I expected that active application's template directory has highest priority when template resolving. But actually I got the first template accordingly to INSTALLED_APPS order!
If I changing order of installed apps - template is changed correspondingly.</p>

<p>Question: is there way to get template from current application first? Of uniqueness of template name/explicit directory specification is the only way to achieve it?</p>

<p>I wrote a server and it works. I can connect two netcats to it and when I write in the one netcat, I recive it at the other. Now, I want to implement what NC does in PHP</p>

<p>I want to use stream_select to see if I have data on STDIN or on the socket to either send the message from STDIN to the server or reading the incoming message from the server.
Unfortunately the example at the php manual doesn't give me any clue how to do that.
I tried to simply $line = fgets(STDIN) and socket_write($socket, $line) but it doesnt work. So I started to go down and just want stream_select to act up when the user typed the message.</p>

<pre><code>$read = array(STDIN);
$write = NULL;
$exept = NULL;

while(1){

    if(stream_select($read, $write, $exept, 0) &gt; 0)
        echo 'read';
}
</code></pre>

<p>Gives </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PHP Warning:  stream_select(): No stream arrays were passed in
  /home/user/client.php on line 18</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But when I var_dump($read) it tells me, that it is an array with a stream.</p>

<pre><code>array(1) {
  [0]=&gt;
  resource(1) of type (stream)
}
</code></pre>

<p>How do I get stream_select to work?</p>

<hr>

<p>PS: In Python I can do something like</p>

<pre><code>r,w,e = select.select([sys.stdin, sock.fd], [],[])
for input in r:
    if input == sys.stdin:
        #having input on stdin, we can read it now
    if input == sock.fd
        #there is input on socket, lets read it

I am having a submit php page which is submitting datas from previous form page and also showing submit confirming info.

I want to handle this submission within one same page, but for the new added 2 datas (name &amp; room number) I don't want to do one separate submit() since I don't want the page refreshing,</p>

"15173684","1","15174728","","2013-03-02 11:00:02","","1","428","<p>I have been playing around with converting a string to a value type in .NET, where the resulting value type is unknown. The problem I have encountered in my code is that I need a method which accepts a string, and uses a ""best fit"" approach to populate the resulting value type. Should the mechanism not find a suitable match, the string is returned.</p>

<p>This is what I have come up with:</p>

<pre><code>public static dynamic ConvertToType(string value)
{
    Type[] types = new Type[]
    {
        typeof(System.SByte),
        typeof(System.Byte), 
        typeof(System.Int16), 
        typeof(System.UInt16), 
        typeof(System.Int32), 
        typeof(System.UInt32), 
        typeof(System.Int64), 
        typeof(System.UInt64), 
        typeof(System.Single), 
        typeof(System.Double), 
        typeof(System.Decimal),
        typeof(System.DateTime),
        typeof(System.Guid)
    };
    foreach (Type type in types)
    {
         try
         {
               return Convert.ChangeType(value, type);
         }
         catch (Exception)
         {
             continue;
         }
    }
    return value;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I feel that this approach is probably not best practice because it can only match against the predefined types.</p>

<p>Usually I have found that .NET accommodates this functionality in a better way than my implementation, so my question is: are there any better approaches to this problem and/or is this functionality implemented better in .NET?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Note that the ordering of types in the array is so that the ""best fit"" occurs as accurately as possible for the given types.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> as per miniBill's request, this I how the method might be used (simple example!):</p>

<pre><code>JsonDictionary[""myKey""] = ConvertToType(""255""); // 255 is a stringified json value, which should be assigned to myKey as a byte.

    if ([bolean isEqualToString:@""1""]) // here application fails...
    {
        BOOL *a=[bolean boolValue];

In the process of doing a final save, where I actually write the order with the line items to the database, I call Order.OrderItems.Clear() before adding in the order items that come from a session variable.  For the most part, this code works fine.  But every now and then, I get an error email (errors are caught and sent to me) with the following stack trace:</p>

<pre><code>The ObjectContext instance has been disposed and can no longer be used for operations that require a connection.   at System.Data.Objects.ObjectContext.EnsureConnection()

Major bummer, because I could see a syntax like this being really useful:</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}

...

// No this doesn't exist, I just wish it did!
MyGrid.DataSource = GetAllUsers()
    .AsDynamic()
        .WithProperty(""FullName"", user =&gt; user.FirstName + "" "" + user.LastName)
    .ToEnumerable(); // returns IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt;
MyGrid.DataBind()

...

&lt;asp:BoundField DataField=""FirstName"" HeaderText=""First Name"" /&gt;
&lt;asp:BoundField DataField=""LastName"" HeaderText=""Last Name"" /&gt;
&lt;asp:BoundField DataField=""FullName"" HeaderText=""Full Name"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, <code>AsDynamic()</code> would return a class that would configure the dynamic objects that would be returned by <code>.ToEnumerable()</code> later (because <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cburrows/archive/2009/02/04/c-dynamic-part-vii.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">you can't implement <code>IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt;</code></a>) effectively adding properties to the wrapped data object. The requests for FirstName and LastName would be ""served"" by the real object, and the request for FullName would be routed to a delegate or expression to be evaluated dynamically.</p>

<p>This is a trivial example, because in most cases you could easily add a FullName property to the User object, and you could easily pull this off with a TemplatedField.</p>

<p>But what if the added property was way too difficult to implement in a TemplatedField without several lines of databinding codebehind?  And what if you didn't control the source code for the User class?  Or what if you can't add the property to User because its calculation is dependent on an assembly which itself depends on User's assembly? (circular reference problem)</p>

<p>For this reason it would be great to have a very easy-to-apply data binding wrapper such as this, where you don't have to generate a brand new class every single time.</p>

<p><strong>So what am I really after?</strong></p>

<p>Are there any frameworks or techniques out there that allow this kind of thing? The exact syntax above isn't really important, just the ability to dynamically add stuff to classes and use those proxies in data-binding, without a bunch of manual plumbing code.</p>

<li>If I set the height to 0 and uncheck <code>clip subviews</code> then that header cell is shown but does not get pushed away at the correct position.</li>
<li>If I set the height of the header cell to the visual height then there is an empty space of that height <em>across</em> the whole width of the table which I don't want... </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> I just realized that apple uses such a list for the search (grouped by messages, mails, contacts, calenders etc.). So my question basically is how can I tweak <code>UITableView</code> in order to behave like the grouped search results... :-)</p>

<pre><code>- MainView
    - containerview
        - subview
            -some buttons
    -some buttons
</code></pre>

<p>I've made a animation to make my subview appears and disappear by clicking a button in the master view.  The following is a part of the code to make the subview disappeared and reappeared :</p>

<pre><code> [UIView animateWithDuration:0.4 //begin animation
                      delay:0.1 
                    options:UIViewAnimationCurveEaseIn

                     [UIView transitionWithView:containerview

                                        options:UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionCurlUp
                                     animations:^{ [subView removeFromSuperview] ;}
                                     completion:nil];
                     containerview.alpha = 0;

                 } 
                 completion:^(BOOL finished){
                     saveButton.hidden = true;
                     saveDAVButton.hidden = true;    
                     saveDBButton.hidden = true; 
                     loadButton.hidden = false;
                     openDAVButton.hidden = false;    
                     openDBButton.hidden = false;
                     [UIView transitionWithView:containerview 
                                       duration:0.4
                                        options:UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionCurlDown
                                     animations:^{ [containerview addSubview:subView] ;}
                                     completion:nil];
                     containerview.alpha = 1;
                 }
 ];
</code></pre>

<p>This animation works perfectly.  The only problem is that even when the subview is visible (so subview buttons as well), i can click buttons behind the subview! (buttons from the master view). That makes buttons from the subview hard to use, because they overlap buttons from masterview.</p>

<p>Any idea how to make element behind the subview unclickable?</p>

<p>I already tried to make buttons from master view disable and hidden, but even then, i can't use overlapping buttons from subview!  </p>

<p>Thank you for your help.  </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I've found what the problem is.  Actually, i have again to make my post clearer.  Here is the hierarchy of the views, with there position and size :</p>

<pre><code>- MainWindow (0,0,768,1024)
    - MainView (0,0,768,80) (this is actually a top tool bar)
        - containerview (500,40,120,80)
            - subview (500,40,120,80) (will act as a post it : curl up and down...)
</code></pre>

<p>So, the problem is that the bottom of my subview is going outside of MainView.  Nothing happen when a click to buttons place at the bottom of subview.  In fact, i am clicking on MainWindow!  Hafl of subview is unclickable...</p>

<p>Before changing all my code, is there a way to make accessible bottom of subview even if he is part of MainView?  Or do i have to move it in MainWindow?</p>

<p>Thank you again...</p>

<p>after doing some digging, ive found that the best practice for changing the log message is using the post-commit hook to change the log message, the problematic part for me is to share the string from the .exe onto the post-commit hook.</p>

<p>things ive tried (maybe someone can shed a light on pros\cons):</p>

<ol>
<li>Using Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable(envname,value) and using %envname% inside the post-commit-hook.bat, that seems to be not working since the envname is being created with setX and assigned to machine rather than the user setting it from the exe process</li>
<li>Writing to the exe app.settings the values i want to preserve and re-call the .exe from the post-commit-hook</li>
</ol>

<p>The 2nd try seems like its gonna work, but i think its a bit odd how theres no faster\intuitive solution for this</p>

<p>Any suggestion in that matter?</p>

<p>My App has quite a few forms and I would like to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Serialize the form inputs to JSON</li>
<li>Send the JSON to the server</li>
</ol>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the best way to serialize the form inputs to JSON? Perhaps a Backbone only solution?</li>
<li>Once the form inputs serialized to JavaScript Objects - what is the best way to send JSON to the server? </li>
</ol>

<p>My code so far:</p>

<p><strong>Javascript and Backbone</strong></p>

<pre><code>$(function(){
    $.fn.serializeObject = function()
    {
        var o = {};
        var a = this.serializeArray();
        $.each(a, function() {
            if (o[this.name] !== undefined) {
                if (!o[this.name].push) {
                    o[this.name] = [o[this.name]];
                }
                o[this.name].push(this.value || '');
            } else {
                o[this.name] = this.value || '';
            }
        });
        return o;
    };

    //Model 
    var SignupForm = Backbone.Model.extend();

    //View
    var SignupView = Backbone.View.extend({
        el: '.signupForm',
        events: {
            'click input.submit': 'getStatus'
        },
        getStatus: function(event){
            var data = JSON.stringify($('form').serializeObject());
            $('.test').html(data);
            return false;
        }
    });

    var signupForm = new SignupForm();
    var signupView = new SignupView({
        model: signupForm
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>HTML</strong> </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""signupForm""&gt;
    &lt;form class""signup""&gt;
        &lt;label for=""name"" &gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;

        &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""submit"" class=""submit"" /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;

    &lt;div class=""test""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm new to Backbone so sorry if this is trivial.</p>

<p>I'm keen to code my application the best way as possible so please feel free to tell me if there is a better way to do this.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>In response to daxim's comment on his answer: ""You can edit comments. - Either edit Config.pm, the key urllist is an arrayref of strings; or run o conf urllist at the CPAN prompt. – daxim 16 hours ago"" - I tried your suggestions below, daxim:</p>

<p>First I tried:</p>

<pre><code>  cpan&gt; o conf urllist
    urllist
        ftp://ftp.perl.org/pub/CPAN/
Type 'o conf' to view configuration edit options
</code></pre>

<p>Followed instructions (i.e. 3rd example bullet under heading ""changing of list values: o conf KEY SHIFT|UNSHIFT|PUSH|POP|SPLICE|LIST"" at <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/~andk/CPAN-1.9402/lib/CPAN.pm#changing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/~andk/CPAN-1.9402/lib/CPAN.pm#changing</a> ) to add a http mirror from: <a href=""http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html</a>    </p>

<pre><code>cpan&gt; o conf urllist http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/www.cpan.org/ ftp://ftp.perl.org/pub/CPAN/

cpan&gt; o conf urllist
    urllist
        ftp://ftp.perl.org/pub/CPAN/
Type 'o conf' to view configuration edit options


cpan&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So from the above, my HTTP mirror was not added. Can anyone offer some advice?</p>

<p>So then I tried: ""Either edit Config.pm, the key urllist is an arrayref of strings; "":</p>

<p>The relevant snippet in Config.pm is:</p>

<pre><code> 'urllist' =&gt; [q[ftp://ftp.perl.org/pub/CPAN/]],
  'wget' =&gt; q[/usr/bin/wget],
</code></pre>

<p>How would my arrayref look here - with my list of mirrors. i.e. tell me how I should edit it, please.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>The instructions given in <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/~andk/CPAN-1.9402/lib/CPAN.pm#changing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/~andk/CPAN-1.9402/lib/CPAN.pm#changing</a> (3rd example bullet), to add a URL to the urllist are incomplete, i.e. wrong, they missed out the push. The successful command is:</p>

<pre><code>[root CPAN]# cpan
Terminal does not support AddHistory.

cpan shell -- CPAN exploration and modules installation (v1.7602)
ReadLine support available (try 'install Bundle::CPAN')

cpan&gt; o conf urllist push http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/www.cpan.org/

cpan&gt; o conf urllist
    urllist
        ftp://ftp.perl.org/pub/CPAN/
        http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/www.cpan.org/
Type 'o conf' to view configuration edit options


cpan&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>From:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=551175"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=551175</a></p>

<p><strong>Other important things:</strong></p>

<p>Beforehand, must check if installing a new module, whether or not it also installs dependencies - i.e other modules - and if they are newer versions of those existing on the machine and therefore if their behaviour or interface has changed that would impact existing applications running on the machine: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4124843/does-cpan-installing-of-new-modules-impact-perl-cgi-applications-on-same-live-pro"">Does CPAN installing of new modules impact Perl-CGI applications on same live production server?</a></p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong></p>

<p>It would appear that editing the urllist is not persistent, as, on re-entering cpan after previous exit, only the ftp entry remains.</p>

<pre><code>cpan&gt; o conf urllist
    urllist
        ftp://ftp.perl.org/pub/CPAN/

<p>All of this works fine. I get the data from a list in FragmentA and it gets passed back to MainActivity. The setCurrentItem(1) displays Fragment B.</p>

<p>The part that I am stuck on is how I can run FragmentB.upDateEquipment(kks)  between kks = data and viewPager.SetCurrentItem() in onDataPass.</p>

<p>I can get the value of kks from Fragment B and run upDateEquipment by implementing setOnClickItemListener from a button in Fragment B and this works but I would prefer not to have to add the extra click for the user.   </p>

<p>Everything works fine but I think it's good practice to include the isPINCorrect method in the validator class (am I wrong?). I can implement the method in the validator but then I have a problem how to setName for the WaiterBean and it's needed for the application.
How should I resolve the problem? Or another question, should I even try to resolve it?</p>

<p>The current navigation template is like so: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;nav class=""primary""&gt;
&lt;span class=""nav-open-button""&gt;²&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;% loop $Menu(2) %&gt;
        &lt;li class=""$LinkingMode""&gt;&lt;a href=""$Link"" title=""$Title.XML""&gt;$MenuTitle.XML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;% end_loop %&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>I'm thinking i could somehow edit <code>$Menutitle.XML</code> but how? Also the sub title should be displayed directly under the Title but as the same button. The SubTitle would need to have a different css rule so that it could be smaller. I know that the CMS has an area for me to edit the page titles which become the menu titles, would it be easy to add a subtitle to the admin like that or is there some other easier way? I only need to make a few of them. </p>

<p>I've seen a lot of people - especially in enterprise environments - letting Hibernate generate separate tables, instead of creating foreign key constraints. </p>

<p>In particular, if you have Table A and Table B, and the relationship is 1-to-many, then people tend to let Hibernate generate the table Table A_B which contains the primary keys of A and B, and which exhibits the 1-to-many relationship. More specifically, they extract the foreign key constraint into a new - and separate - table.</p>

<p>1) From a performance perspective this isn't so fortunate, extra-table (more memory) and usually more joins are needed, which may negatively impact performance. Of course, it depends on the underlying implementation, because with caching and smart cursor management this can be mitigated.</p>

<p>2) Is the semantics and/or understandability affected? If so, what about the rule never to look at generated code? (advocates of code generation will give a categorical NO). This only applies if you generate your tables from a model (like Hibernate allows you to do).</p>

<p>3) Normal forms are not affected by this way of designing your tables, however, it does contribute to the ""explosion of tables"" as you try to impose higher normal forms.</p>

<p>I really do not understand whether there is a hidden meaning to this ""best practice"" (if it is one), or if it's just a mistake/lack of understanding in configuring Hibernate ;-).</p>

<p>Any and all opinions are more than welcome!</p>

<p>EDIT: The tables/relations are NOT n-to-m (many-to-many). Also, you can let Hibernate generate a relation instead of a foreign key constraint, my question (the one above) is why would you do that?!</p>

<p>The below code and the accompanying fiddle provide an example. When the spinner (the buttons on the right side of the input field) is clicked, the number field starts at 0. I would like to be able to change this initial value (e.g., set is to .53).</p>

<p>The input field needs to be empty otherwise (to avoid influencing user responses as much as possible and to make it obvious that the field has not been filled out). Therefore, using ""value"" or ""defaultValue"" doesn't lead to the desired solution. Using a placeholder doesn't work either as this does not change the starting value of the spinner. </p>

    lua_pop(luaState, 1);

    LuaObject *luaObject = [objectMap objectForKey:name]

    void *luaUserdataPtr = lua_newuserdata(luaState, sizeof(LuaObject*));
    void *luaObjectPtr = (__bridge_retained void *)luaObjectPtr;
    memcpy(ptr, &amp;luaObjectPtr, sizeof(LuaObject*));

    luaL_getmetatable(luaState, ""LuaObject"");
    lua_setmetatable(luaState, -2);

</code></pre>

<p>Now when <code>proxyLuaObjectCall</code> is called from lua, I want to be able to retrieve the instance of the LuaObject on which the method is being called. Above code works perfectly when calling a method without any arguments. But when calling a method that has any arguments the code fails with the error </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>bad argument #0 to '' (LuaObject expected, got table).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example when using the following code in lua:</p>

<p><strong>This works perfectly:</strong></p>

<pre><code>myObject = getObjectWithName(""nominator"");
myObject.talk();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This fails miserably</strong> </p>

<pre><code>myObject = getObjectWithName(""nominator"");
myObject.say(""And the winner is"");

// Result: bad argument #0 to 'say' (LuaObject expected, got table).
</code></pre>

<p>--</p>

<pre><code>myObject = getObjectWithName(""nominator"");
myObject.say(""And the winner is"", ""Joan"");

// Result: bad argument #0 to 'say' (LuaObject expected, got string).
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried changing the index when calling a method that has arguments but nothing on the stack contains a reference to the LuaObject instance.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong here? What should I do to retrieve the instance of the LuaObject on which the method is called?</p>

This morning i installed a couple of GPS position mockers to test my application and no one seemed to work well. Uninstalled all of them and (i don't know if this is related at any point) now when i debug my application on my N4 using ADB, the GPS won't turn on when i call .requestLocationUpdates. The gps icon doesn't show in the notification bar and no data is retrieved, onLicationChanged is never called and the function .isProvider enabled returns false..</p>

<p>I completly reconstructed my application to the simplest form possible. I call code copied from android.developper documentation directly on the onCreate override.</p>

<pre><code>    @Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
setContentView(R.layout.activity_speed_monitoring);
// Acquire a reference to the system Location Manager
LocationManager locationManager = (LocationManager) this .getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);
// Define a listener that responds to location updates
LocationListener locationListener = new LocationListener() {
    public void onLocationChanged(Location location) {

        location.getLatitude();
        Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), ""Current speed:"" + location.getSpeed(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
    public void onStatusChanged(String provider, int status, Bundle extras) { }
    public void onProviderEnabled(String provider) { }
    public void onProviderDisabled(String provider) { }
};
locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, 0, 1000, locationListener); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now i'm wondering if this is related to my code or my android device, or both. Tested Google maps and it trigger's the GPS icon and find my location without problem, i'm testing it on the android simulator now, will keep updated.</p>

<p>Oh and also, i'm unsing android studio.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>EDIT: The GPS icon is triggered on the emulator, might be a setting in my phone, but what can cause this? And why do other GPS applications work?</p>

<p>EDIT 2 : My application works perfectly fine on the emulator, update the location via telnet geo fix and everything works like a charm..</p>

<p>The error occurs where the <code>table</code> element opens.</p>

<p>How can I fix this without doing one of the following?</p>

<ul>
<li>Removing the <code>runat=""server""</code> attribute </li>
<li>Removing the <code>thead</code> element</li>
<li>Changing it to an <code>asp:table</code> element</li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus up vote for someone who explains what 2012 is doing differently that is causing this.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>The problem does not occur in a web <em>app</em>, only in a web site.</p>

<p>The project isn't actually be upgraded, just my development environment. In both cases, I'm using the 4.0 framework</p>

<p>I tried using the 4.5 framework, but it didn't help.</p>

<p>Sept 10th, 2012:
I have an open case with Microsoft support. Their dev team is looking into it.</p>

<p>Oct. 24, 2012:
Since .NET 4.5 replaces 4.0, I can no longer compile in VS 2010 also. The problem I am experiencing is purely .NET - not Visual Studio. </p>

<p>Currently I'm using ""Rule Sets"" feature to group rules to different processes:</p>

<pre><code> public class ObjAValidation: AbstractValidator&lt;A&gt;
    {
        public ObjAValidation()
        {
            RuleSet(""ProcessA"", () =&gt;
            {
                RuleFor(x =&gt; ...);
                RuleFor(x =&gt; ...);
            }); 
           RuleSet(""ProcessB"", () =&gt;
            {
                RuleFor(x =&gt; ...);
                RuleFor(x =&gt; ...);
            }); 
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And then validate using:</p>

<pre><code>var a = new A(){...};
IValidator&lt;A&gt; validator = new ObjAValidation();
var result = validator.Validate(a, ruleSet: ""ProcessA"");
</code></pre>

<p>I have two problems with this approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>I don't like to use strings as process names. I would like to use a
more strongly typed approach. For example to be able to use marker
interfaces or attributes.</li>
<li>In my Unit tests I can't setup the Validate method of IValidator
because you can't use optional arguments with Moq.</li>
</ol>

<p><pre><code>
Mock&lt;IValidator&lt;A&gt;&gt; _mockValidator = new Mock&lt;IValidator&lt;A&gt;&gt;();
_mockValidator.Setup(x =&gt; x.Validate(new A(), ruleSet: &quot;ProcessA&quot;));
</pre></code>
Second line generates a run time error: <strong>An expression tree may not contain a named argument specification.</strong> And if you want to pass the ruleSet argument without a named argument to Validate method you have to provide a ""IValidatorSelector selector"" object. But this interface is not documented.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example. I have a top-level function <code>topfunction</code> with one numeric argument. Inside of <code>topfunction</code> I call another function <code>lowerfunction</code> which argument is a call to a function defined inside of <code>lowerfunction</code>.</p>

<pre><code>topfunction&lt;-function(x){  
  lowerfunction(myfun(first=x[1],second=x[2],third=if(length(x)&gt;2) x[3]))
}

lowerfunction&lt;-function(mycall){ 

  myfun&lt;-function(first,second=0,third=NULL){
    print(first)
    print(second)
    print(third)
  }

  mc&lt;-match.call(definition = myfun, call = match.call()[[2]]) 
  eval(mc) 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Inside of <code>lowerfunction</code> I capture the function call with <code>match.call</code>, and try to evaluate the call. But as variable <code>x</code> is only defined in the environment of <code>topfunction</code>, the evaluation fails:</p>

<pre><code>topfunction(x=1:3)
Error in print(first) : object 'x' not found
</code></pre>

<p>I know that I could change the line </p>

<pre><code>lowerfunction(myfun(first=x[1],second=x[2],third=if(length(x)&gt;2) x[3]))
</code></pre>

<p>as</p>

<pre><code>lowerfunction(substitute(myfun(first=x[1],second=x[2],third=if(length(x)&gt;2) x[3])))
</code></pre>

<p>in <code>topfunction</code>, but in my real application the <code>topfunction</code> is constructed by the user, so the solution should happen somehow in the <code>lowerfunction</code> or even in the <code>myfun</code> level. But as they have already lost the information about <code>x</code>, I don't know if that can be accomplished? </p>

<p>In the real application the <code>topfunction</code> constructs the model using <code>lowerfunction</code> and computes its likelihood, whereas the argument of <code>lowerfunction</code> is a formula which can contain function calls, which will be evaluated via <code>eval</code>. These functions are only defined inside the <code>lowerfunction</code>. Also, <code>lowerfunction</code> can also be called directly, i.e. </p>

<pre><code>x&lt;-1:3
lowerfunction(myfun(first=x[1],second=x[2],third=if(length(x)&gt;2) x[3]))
# or
lowerfunction(myfun(first=x1,second=2)
</code></pre>

<p>So solutions which add <code>x</code> to the argument list of <code>lowerfunction</code> are not applicable in general.</p>

<p>So the problem is that <code>eval</code> should take the definition of <code>myfun</code> from one environment (package namespace, or in this case from the environment of <code>lowerfunction</code>), and evaluate the arguments of <code>myfun</code> in other environment i.e in the environment of <code>topfunction</code>. </p>

<p>I've also installed IIS 7 on the machine as well added Asp.Net V4 to the app pool (following these instructions: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4890245/how-to-add-asp-net-4-0-as-application-pool-on-iis-7-windows-7"">How to add ASP.NET 4.0 as Application Pool on IIS 7, Windows 7</a>).  </p>

<p>I've added the site as 'precompile' using the v4 framework and I can browse the site from IIS without any difficulty.</p>

<p>My problem is when I try to run the command.  I am running the cmd window as admin as well as using a pretty similar command to what I had previously used which is: ""aspnet_compiler -v /precompile -u -f -fixednames -c c:\SiteCompile\post_compile""</p>

<p>However I get the message: ""error ASPRUNTIME: '/precompile' is not a valid IIS application'.</p>

<p>Admittedly administration and setup are not my strongest suit, so I am pretty sure I am just missing a step somewhere.  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!  I believe that's all of the relevant information but if more is needed please let me know.</p>

<p>Given an array_of_ints, find the highest_values you can get from three of the integers.</p>

<p>Basically, ignore the negative sign and find the 3 highest values and append to a new array while keeping the negative sign on those values.  Here is my current work:</p>

<pre><code>def highest_values(array):
    sort = sorted(array)
    new_array=[]
    while len(new_array)&lt;3:
        for i in range(0,len(sort)):

                    new_array.append(sort[i])
                    break
    print(new_array)

highest_values([-100, 5, 50, -200, 10, 1, 60])

<p>Can I get some tips on my current code or am I approaching this the wrong way?</p>

Currently the matrices the function accepts are the normal R matrix type. However I'd like to assign them as a different type or class so as to achieve easy input checking so the user can't throw any matrix into the function.</p>

<p>I figured the S3 method would be easy after seeing a few examples on the net:</p>

<pre><code>mat1 &lt;- matrix(c(1:10),ncol=5)

colnames(mat1) &lt;- c(""ONE"",""TWO"",""THREE"",""FOUR"",""FIVE"")

as.sdpmgdna &lt;- function(x) {
  class(x) &lt;- ""sdpmgdna""
  return(x)
}

mat2 &lt;- as.sdpmgdna(mat1)
</code></pre>

<p>This appears to work in so far as if I return mat2 I see a matrix, and if I call it via indecies mat2[1,2] I get the right values I should get. However I can't be sure some things have changed - it is now described as sdpmgdna[10] i.e. it seems to ignore it has 2 dimensions, although doing the above and printing mat2 to screen shows it clearly does have 2 dimensions. Another odd thing is if I do <code>colnames(mat2)</code> they are returned. However if I try to find the colname of an individual column e.g. <code>colname(mat2[,4])</code> then the value returned is <code>NULL</code>. Can anyone explain why this is or what I should do - I really want it to basically be a matrix, but because the functions require it to be very specific in terms of a matrix of what and how big, defining it as another class would make error and input checking so much easier - and allow me to use the methods mechanism of R so all my custom plotting functions could just be methods of plot().</p>

<pre><code>module M1

module M2
  def test_method
    true

(x = String.new).extend(M1)
(y = String.new).extend(M2)

<p>Then,</p>

<pre><code>x.methods.include?(""test_method"")
=&gt; false
y.methods.include?(""test_method"")

<pre><code>div class=""fb-like"" data-href=""http://www.mywebpage.com/myproductpage"" data-send=""false"" data-layout=""button_count"" data-width=""80"" data-show-faces=""false"" etc.
</code></pre>

<p>This page works fine in all browsers on all computer platforms, as well as on Android devices.  Unfortunately, all the separate Facebook Like buttons seem to create a memory issue for iPads and iPhones, and Safari crashes on our page on these devices.</p>

<p>The div class=""fb-like"" etc. part of each like button is not something I can easily change on our thousands of pages to make iPads happy, but I can easily remove the standard Facebook code that appears at the top of those pages which makes the Like buttons work.  What I'd like to do is replace the Facebook code at the top of each of our pages with my own HTML that grabs the data in each of these ""Like buttons"" and generates my own buttons that function a bit differently.  (Perhaps they each will link to a separate page that will then be a sharing page when the pages is loaded on an iOS device.)  Only issue is I don't quite grasp the HTML/CSS/Javascript required to cause each of these items with class=""fb-like"" to trigger something to generate content within them.  I imagine this is what the Facebook code linked to at the top of a page with Like buttons does.</p>

<p>Can someone briefly explain to me how to access the data in a class=""fb-like"" part of my page, and put my own item there?  I can then dynamically do something different on iPads/iPhones so they don't crash, perhaps by just turning the like buttons into sharing page links.</p>

<p>I can write my own Javascript/HTML code for that just fine, but only after I have some understanding of how to access the data values in each ""fb-like"" DIV and how to cause my generated code to trigger to appear on that page in each of those 250 places.</p>

<p>Any examples of accessing the data within a class=""fb-like"" part of my page and then generating something in them would be appreciated.  Even the very simplest of examples should be enough for me to understand how to program whatever I need from there.  Can someone just help get me started?</p>

<p>E.g. this question about binary search: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5154402/is-binary-search-theta-log-n-or-big-o-logn"">Is binary search theta log (n) or big O log(n)</a></p>

<p>Consider <code>*-case</code> performances:</p>

<p>Best-case performance: Θ(1)<br>
Average-case performance: Θ(log n)<br>
Worst-case performance: Θ(log n)</p>

<p>He then quotes <em>Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest: ""Introduction to Algorithms""</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What we mean when we say ""the running time is O(n^2)"" is that the worst-case running time (which is a function of n) is O(n^2) ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn't this suggest the terms <code>running time</code> and <code>worst-case running time</code> are synonymous?</p>

<p>Also, if <code>running time</code> refers to a function with natural input <code>f(n)</code>, then there has to be <code>Θ</code> class which contains it, e.g. <code>Θ(f(n))</code>, right? This indicates that you are obligated to use <code>O</code> notation only when the running time is not known very precisely (i.e. only an upper bound is known).</p>

<p>For many of them I can just use Exif info such as date taken to determine a match. But some are really old, and either the original file didn't have Exif info, or it got clobbered by whatever stupid resizing software I used at the time.</p>

<p>So, unable to rely on metadata, I'm forced to resort to the content itself. The problem is that the originals are in different resolutions than the ones on Flickr (which is the whole point of this endeavour). So is there a way for me to compare them with some sort of fuzzy similarity measure that would allow me to set a threshold for requiring human input or not?</p>

<p>I guess knowing one image is a resized version of the other can yield better results than general similarity. A solution in any language will do, but Ruby would be a plus :)</p>

<li><p>Even though the Allocated memory in the Heap tab of DDMS and the heap dumps themselves only show 7mb of memory as allocated is there hidden memory that is not mentioned that is not being garbage collected?  If so, how do I track this down?</p></li>

Basically, I want the client to send my server a username and password, and I want the server to respond by giving the client a token that can be used in lieu of a password from that point forward.</p>

<p>I've looked into this a little and a recommendation I keep seeing is to use an HMAC with a secret key known only to the server.  I see the benefit of this method, but it still seems to me that this isn't ideal, since as far as I am able to tell it cannot be expired.  </p>

<p>I can add extra security by adding the ip address to the string used for creating/verifying the hmac, I believe, but I'm still not sure if this is the best way.</p>

<p>Is there any reason not to just have my authentication token simply be generated with something like openssl_random_pseudo_bytes() and stored in my database along with an ip address and username?  Then I can just send the user that and verify it against what's in the database.  It also allows me to easily expire or log out the user.</p>

Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. Try this: (1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it.

Make a symbolic breakpoint at UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints to catch this in the debugger.
The methods in the UIConstraintBasedLayoutDebugging category on UIView listed in &lt;UIKit/UIView.h&gt; may also be helpful.

The import will typically be initiated by a user entering some settings in a web page, including the local file to be imported. When the user hits the ""import"" the file should be uploaded and then imported.</p>

<p>The import can be quite a lengthy operation, so it is not possible to do it directly from the aspx.cs code, it need to be done in some background way. Also it is important that once the file is uploaded, the import is not lost. I would also like the import to start <em>immediately</em>, not having to wait for a service or scheduled task that just checks for available work every X minutes.</p>

<p>What I've found as alternatives so far is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Background thread from ThreadPool or similar in ASP.NET. Will mostly work, but if the app pool is recycled the work is lost.</li>
<li>Service with a timer that regularly checks a work table in the DB and runs the import. Will work, but either has the delay or causes very frequent requests for work from the DB.</li>
<li>Service with a change notification query (don't know the exact name, but it is possible to subscribe to changes from SQL server).</li>
<li>Service getting work items through MSMQ.</li>
<li>WCF service, hosted within a system service and not within ASP.NET to avoid recycling. Either the WCF service is called internally from ASP.NET or it is directly exposed and called from the client through AJAX (if a non-IIS-hosted WCF can expose AJAX endpoints).</li>

<p>Now, I'm assuming this is only the tail of the message that I want to see, but I have no means to view it (ex: cannot Shift-PageUp). When the panic occurs, the above text is never rendered for a second on the screen.</p>

<p>I first stumbled upon a <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelDebuggingTricks"" rel=""nofollow"">KernelDebuggingTricks page</a> which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Slowing down kernel messages on boot</strong></p>
  
  <p>... [Build] the kernel with the following option enabled:</p>
  
  <p>CONFIG_BOOT_PRINTK_DELAY=y</p>
  
  <p>And boot the machine with the following kernel boot parameter:</p>
  
  <p>boot_delay=N</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have confirmed that my kernel (3.16) had built with the <code>CONFIG_BOOT_PRINTK_DELAY</code> option and have tried setting <code>boot_delay</code> to 10, 500 and 1000 milliseconds in my GRUB. Even with the 1000 millisecond delay set (and waiting for a good ~5 minutes), the entire kernal panic log message is spewed out in a blink of an eye.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can view the root of the kernel panic? The only thing I'm thinking now is manually adding sleeps into the kernel code (which is something I'd like to avoid).</p>

I need to have the client running but then be able to write and read in a separate method from where the socket, streams, etc are. I'm sure this is a very simple solution and I'm probably over thinking it, I've googled it and I just can't seem to wrap my brain around it. 
Basically my final structure should be</p>

<pre><code>public Client
{
Instantiate sockets/streams, etc here.
}
public void writeAndRead
{
Write and read here.
}

<p>My current problem is I cannot call my writer from another method.

<pre><code>import java.net.*;

{

private int port;

{
host = host2;
port = port2;
    //Instantiate a stringbuffer to store the reply from the server.
    StringBuffer instr = new StringBuffer();

    //Stores the host string into a usable IP.
    InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName(host);

    //Instantiate a socket with the given IP and port name.
    Socket socket = new Socket(address, port);

    //Instantiate a output stream to the socket.
    BufferedOutputStream stream = new BufferedOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());

    //Instantiate a writer for the output stream using standard encoding.
    OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(stream, ""US-ASCII"");

    //Instantiate an input stream to read in reply from server.
    BufferedInputStream inputStream = new BufferedInputStream(socket.getInputStream());

    //Instantiate a reader to read and convert the stream, once again using standard encoding.
    InputStreamReader reader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream, ""US-ASCII""); 

        //Create the string to send to server with a char to let the stream reader know when     the stream is completed.
        String process = ""x"" + (char) 0;

        //Write the string to the output stream.
        writer.write(process);

        //Clear the output stream.
        writer.flush();

        //Int c reads the data from the input stream.
        int c;

        //Receive the message and print.

<p>And I did that, thanks to everyone by the way!</p>

<p>Now, my only question is how would I set up a table for this? Right now I just have it so that it adds tabs or spaces before it prints the numbers. Is there another way to make it so that the numbers are lined up with their respective headers?</p>

<p>E.G.</p>

<pre><code>Number     Divisors     Prime Divisors
12         2 3 4 6 12   2 2 3

Number     Divisors     Prime Divisors
2          2            2

Number     Divisors     Prime Divisors
240        2 3 4 5 6    2 2 2 2 3 5
           8 10 12 15
           16 20 24 30
           40 48 60 80
           120 240
</code></pre>

<p>Or at least:</p>

<pre><code>Number    Divisors                                               Prime Divisors
240       2 3 4 5 6 8 10 12 15 16 20 24 30 40 48 60 80 120 240   2 2 2 2 3 5
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Just changed my code so that now the prime divisors are simply set onto a new line and then tabbed over from there. Not exactly what I wanted, but it's better than it being all over the place. Updated code as well.</p>

<p>So it does this basically:</p>

<pre><code>Number     Divisors                                              Prime Divisors
240        2 3 4 5 6 8 10 12 15 16 20 24 30 40 48 60 80 120 140
                                                                 2 2 2 2 3 5

Basically, I just want it to automatically run an external PHP/MySQL script that adds a +1 to the ""rating"" column for what was liked. I want this to happen without reloading the page, hence AJAX. I've never used AJAX and I'm having some trouble getting it to work. Below is the relevant code and I put a link to where I'm working on it at at the bottom of this post.</p>

<p>Here's the form to start:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""voting""&gt;    
&lt;form&gt;   
  &lt;input name=""vote"" type='button' onclick=""getVote(&lt;?php echo $image['filename'];?&gt;)"" value='Like' /&gt; 
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>Here's the AJAX part of it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
function getVote(filename)
{
if (window.XMLHttpRequest)
  {// code for IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari
  xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
  }
else
  {// code for IE6, IE5
  xmlhttp=new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP"");
  }
xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function()
  {
  if (xmlhttp.readyState==4 &amp;&amp; xmlhttp.status==200)
    {
    document.getElementById(""voting"").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;
    }
  }
xmlhttp.open(""GET"",""voting.php""+filename,true);
xmlhttp.send();
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, the voting.php script that's supposed to run:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
//Database Information
$dbhost = """";
$dbname = """";
$dbuser = """";
$dbpass = """";

//Connect to database
mysql_connect ( $dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass)or die(""Could not connect: "".mysql_error());
mysql_select_db($dbname) or die(mysql_error());

$filename = $_GET['filename'];

$query = ""UPDATE images SET rating = rating+1 WHERE filename = '$filename'"";

mysql_query($query) or die(mysql_error());
mysql_close();

?&gt;

<p>However, I am only going to use hands which are > 4200 sq pixels in area, which leaves me with just 621 hands. I realised that this may not be enough &amp; I will look for more images if need be. However, all the images are annotated as follows:</p>

<p>However, the bounding box is NOT aligned with the x &amp; y axis. </p>

<p>I believe I have to crop the hands out of the image. I have 2 ways of doing this:</p>

<p>1) let xmin and xmax be minimum and maximum x coordinates of the bounding box. While ymin &amp; ymax are the minimum &amp; maximum y coordinates of the bounding box. If do this, I'll get this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zJnk7.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> (without the bounding box, of course)
basically, some part of the background remains in the above.</p>

<p>2) I can use a binary mask to ""mask' out all the pixels INSIDE the bounding box. If I do this, the size of my image will still be from xmin to xmax &amp; ymin to ymax, however I can set the rest of the background to be white.</p>

<p><strong>What would be better? I believe the positives are supposed to only contain the object of interest (hands in this case), so leaving the background may not be right? However, would a white background be ok?</strong></p>

<p>From what I understand, Rails 3 should be rack compatible, so from the server's point of view, it's no different than any Sinatra application right?</p>

<p>I have most of the system at a more or less functioning state, but I'm still missing a feature to mark unread threads for the users when there are new posts.</p>

<p>The thing is I can't really think of a way to properly store that information. My first idea was to create another model that will store a list of threads with changes in them for each user. Something with one <code>ForeignKey(User)</code> and one <code>ForeignKey(Thread)</code> and just keep adding new entries each time a thread is posted or a post is added to a thread.</p>

<p>But then, I'm not sure how well that would scale with say several hundred threads after a while and maybe 50-200 users. So add 200 rows for each new post for the users who aren't logged on? Sounds like a lot.</p>

<p>How do other forum systems do it anyway? And how can I implement a system to work these things out in Django.</p>

<p>I am trying to get the benefits of OBR in my application. I took Karaf Cave (4.0.0) as OBR implementation and org.apache.felix.bundlerepository (2.0.4) as OBR client. I successfully configured the repository itself but I can't properly use it.
The problem is: when I install the bundle via OBR and all its dependencies are already installed in OSGI runtime, it is installed successfully. But if some of the requirements are missing, I got an ""Unsatisfied requirements"" error, which is odd, since I know for sure that all the resources which resolves these requirements are present in the OBR descriptor and all links to them are valid.</p>

<p>Why aren't they resolved automatically? How to configure OBR client to work with Karaf Cave?</p>

<p>I also tried OBR implementation from Sonatype Nexus (OBR plugin) and found out that the OBR descriptor generated by Cave, and the one generated by Nexus, are differ. Moreover:</p>

<ul>
<li>the one generated by Cave is OSGI compendium spec compliant</li>
<li>the one generated by Nexus is not, but works like a charm with org.apache.felix.bundlerepository - the problem is not reproduced.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am completely confused.</p>

<p>The step sequence to reproduce the problem (reproduced on Apache Karaf 4.0.0):</p>

<p>1) Installing Karaf Cave:</p>

<pre><code>feature:repo-add cave
feature:install cave-server cave-http
</code></pre>

<p>2) Creating a cave repository:</p>

<pre><code>cave:create-repository test
cave:proxy-repository test file:///path/to/some/local/maven/repo
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>On this step I am able to successfully retrieve an OBR descriptor from 
<a href=""http://localhost:8181/cave/http/test-repository.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8181/cave/http/test-repository.xml</a></li>
</ul>

<p>3) Install the OBR client and register 'test' cave repository from Karaf:</p>

<pre><code>feature:install obr
obr:url-add http://localhost:8181/cave/http/test-repository.xml
</code></pre>

<p>4) Try to deploy some OBR resources with obr:deploy</p>

<p>None of these seem to work. I have an Apache server also running locally, and am able to connect to that, so it's not an issue with the network.  Is there any way to connect to localhost:8000 from within VMWare?</p>

<h2><strong>Update</strong>: To get this to work, I used the following settings:</h2>

<ul>
<li>In VMWare, set the network of the VM to ""Connect directly to the physical network (Bridged)"", rather than ""Share this Mac's network connection (NAT)""</li>
<li>Find the IP address of the Mac itself on the network the Mac itself is on (not the private network VMWare sets up), e.g. 192.168.1.2.  This can be found in ifconfig, or in System Preferences > Network</li>
<li>Start the Django development server on that IP address: sudo python manage.py runserver 192.168.1.2:80</li>

var dateString = sheet.getRange(dateColumns[r] + '1:' + dateColumns[r] + lastRow.toString()).getValues();
var dateArr = Utilities.parseCsv(dateString, '-');
</code></pre>

<p>But that just keeps concatenating all values. Also if it's possible to put the output in a date format that would be great too.</p>

<p>Originally, I wanted to migrate this to Sass, as I was always led to believe this was the 'best' preprocessor, but having read some articles, the differences appear to be very minor, and there doesn't appear to be anything that can't be done in one that you can't do in the other. Articles shy from definitively stating one is best and instead just give an overview of the various options.</p>

<p>Is there any significant benefits of one over the other, or are the differences too minor to merit changing?</p>

<p>But hard part of this problem for me;
idnumbers must be unique but first 22 arrays ( which parent value is 0 ) idnumbers can be found rest of the arrays idnumber (not much a few).And that makes hard solve this problem for me.I tried different methods but each way not efficient as i want.</p>

<p>I was able to make it work in all browsers except IE 7 and 8 (I don't care about IE 6).</p>

<p>My solution was simply to make the background semitransparent using rgba and the hover style alters that style. Of course, rgba isn't available in IE prior to 9, so I use filter and -ms-filter with a gradient to achieve the same effect.</p>

<p>The problem is that the element doesn't seem to receive any hover event once the gradient filter is applied since the hover style isn't used and the javascript event isn't called.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to receive a hover event while using gradient filters in IE?</p>

<p>Here is the style that is applied to the overlay element:</p>

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>#foo {
    cursor: pointer;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;

<p>I thought about this and this is what I'm thinking. Maybe I can just filter the list on input (when I type into the input box) rather than automatically have this filter. Is this possible?</p>

<hr>

<p>I've created a combo box with angular, and I've bound a scope variable to my input using <code>ng-model</code>. Right now the functionality is, you can search for an item in the dropdown. when you click on an item in the dropdown, that value is copied into the input.</p>

<p>however, when I go back into the input to search again, it only brings up items that match the search, which is expected. But I'd like to make it so when you click on the input again, the text that was in the input stays there, but the drop down shows all results.</p>

<p>is this doable? Maybe I can bind a different scope variable to the value of the input?</p>

<p>I was doing some HttpClient async await requests in a loop, and I noticed that the requests seemed to be done sequentially (it waited for the result before starting next iteration). </p>

<p>So I tried a test using await Task.Delay in a loop instead of web requests.</p>

<p>Maybe I've lost the plot, but I would have thought that await in a loop could result in the next iteration of the loop starting while the result is awaited. Instead it seems that everything executes in sequence:</p>

<pre><code>        int _iterations = 1000;

        int _count= 0;

        Stopwatch   _stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
                    _stopwatch.Start();                      

        for (int i=0; i&lt;_iterations; i++)
        {
                Console.WriteLine(""Elapsed: {0}. Calls count: {1}."", _stopwatch.Elapsed, ++_count);

                await Task.Delay(5000);

                Console.WriteLine(""Calls count again: {0}"", _count);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>This results in:</p>

<pre><code>Elapsed: 00:00:00.0000059. Calls count: 1.
Calls count again: 1
Elapsed: 00:00:05.0022733. Calls count: 2.
Calls count again: 2
Elapsed: 00:00:10.0100470. Calls count: 3.
Calls count again: 3
Elapsed: 00:00:15.0182479. Calls count: 4.
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, I could leave out the await and add the returned Tasks to some array and use Task.WhenAll. But I am surprised that await is blocking in my loop, and that it all executes sequentially. Is this normal?</p>

<p>Edit: So in conclusion: I got a bit confused there. Control is returned to outside the loop at the await. This makes sense because it mimics the synchronous analogy, but of course does not block the thread.</p>

<p>I have added the statement when running both and removed the original one</p>

<pre><code>log4j.rootLogger = DEBUG, FILEALL , FILEMAIN
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the java code:</p>

<pre><code>System.setProperty(""logfile.name"", savePath1);
// System.setProperty(""logfilemain.name"", savePath1);
logger = Logger.getLogger(HarishLog.class.getName());
PropertyConfigurator.configure(""log4j.properties"");
</code></pre>

<p>The code works perfectly fine till I make one log, but as soon as I enable the setting for 2nd log in either the properties or the javafile, nothing happens.</p>

<p>Besides I am unable to put a different name at </p>

<pre><code>log4j.appender.FILEALL.File=${logfile.name}
</code></pre>

<p>it only works for <code>logfile.name</code> and <code>logfilea.name</code>, It doesn't work for any other name if I change it both in the javacode and the properties folder. Why is this???</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>The selectedOrdner buffers the Ordner Object which is actual selected by the user in the TreeView. If its empty it is set to the item at position 0 which is the root directory. When now the user puts a new file in the TreeView</p>

                    tvi.Focus();
</code></pre>

<p>im runnning a method to copy the file and then im reading the new directory structure and want to set the expand property to true from the last treeviewitem which was selected. Because my TreeView was always showing me my rootnode when i put a new file or dir into it.</p>

<p>The Buffer of the selectedOrdner contains as long as im not putting a new file into it the Ordner Object. But when im running the method to copy a file it no longer contains an Object from type Ordner but treeviewitem instead.</p>

<p>I dont get it where it is changed from type Ordner to type TreeViewItem.</p>

<p>edit-----</p>

<p>The error always happens when the TreeView SelectedItemChanged happen.</p>

<pre><code>        private void DokumentBrowser_SelectedItemChanged(object sender, RoutedPropertyChangedEventArgs&lt;object&gt; e)

        selectedOrdner = (Ordner)DokumentBrowser.SelectedItem;

    }
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to add something to the rootnode it works fine it only are the nodes after the first where it starts to break.</p>

<p>edit2------
There was a problem when binding the treeview to a new itemsource that the selecteditemchange method has a disconnecteditem and that could not be castet to a (Ordner) </p>

<p>solved this by making all changes over an observable collection. So the TreeViewItem is Expanded is not longer needed</p>

I am trying to get my head around using the <code>TScrollPagerTool</code> as it seems perfect for what I am trying to achieve but I am experiencing performance issues when resizing. 
In the resize event for the chart it is advised to add the following line if you are using this scrolling tool:</p>

<p>I don't know why you have to reassign the series but the chart won't resize without it.

<p>I've recently taken on a very complex job. It's rewriting an entire company's web-based IT platform. I'm afraid I can't give too many details because we can't let the old developer know (he has a metaphorical gun against the company's head, in that he's the only one who knows how to do critical things like invoice generation, and is demanding more and more money).</p>

<p>The major problem is that the entire web platform (used by all the staff and all the customers) was coded by a guy who's skills were <em>less than amateur</em>. It's made up of ~300 individual code files. There's no template library - it's all hardcoded into each file. There's no logical database structure - it was practically made up as he went along. There's no security - it's shocking. Anyway, we will be rewriting this whole platform over a ~3-month period.</p>

<p>However the boss says that on the morning it goes live, no customer data can be lost anywhere. The whole database contents has to be copied over directly. The structure of the database is currently so poor it's nearly impossible to work with, but this week we  will be (attempting to!) write some scripts to migrate it over to our new, highly relational structure which is far more logical. <strong>The question is, what's the best way to do this?</strong></p>

<p>One example is addresses. In the old database, addresses are used in about 12 tables (of 44 total...). In ours, we are having one <code>addresses</code> table which will be cross-referenced by other tables (e.g. <code>address_id</code>) to keep things clean. The main problem is that in about half of his tables, the addresses are stored as <code>line1</code>, <code>line2</code>, <code>town</code>, <code>city</code>, etc, which is fine, but in the other half he just has a single <code>address</code> field which stores the whole thing!</p>

<p>A second example is dates - in some tables he has seconds-since-Epoch dates, in others MySQL <code>NOW()</code> dates, and in others he literally stores it in 6 columns per row - <code>year</code>, <code>month</code>, <code>day</code>, <code>hour</code>, <code>minute</code>, <code>second</code> - ouch...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What's a good way to go about trying to tackle this? <strong>Should we look at <em>our</em> tables and work out where we need to pull <em>his</em> data from into ours, or should we reverse this and look at <em>his</em> tables and work out where his data needs to go into ours?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>From a programming standpoint, how should we tackle this?</strong> A lot of data needs dynamic formatting (e.g. dates) so we were thinking of plucking data one row at a time, formatting it correctly, then re-inserting it into the right places in our scripts. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Speed and efficiency of queries is not an issue for us,</strong> as we will only need to run this once (after testing), on our local machines. His database is currently ~800MB when SQL dumped, but again a lot of this is his useless test data, or just totally unnecessary. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Any ideas on the best way to tackle this? For reference our system will be re-written in PHP so any PHP-based recommendations would be nice. The database is currently (and still will be) in MySQL.</p>

"8471855","1","8475679","","2011-12-12 08:55:26","","5","6335","<p>I am making  C# / WinForms application. The problem I couldn't solve (yet) is that when I change the SelectedItem of ComboBox programatically, it is changed until the ComboBox loses the focus, after that it ""reminds"" its value before assigning the SelectedItem. I think that it takes the old value from binding source. When choosing an item using UI the underlying bound object is updated normally but it doesn't so when I'm assigning new value to SelectedItem programatically.</p>

<p>Just for additional info: I am trying to implement ""undo"", which means I am saving every change somewhere and when Edit>>>Undo I'm reversing all these changes done by user. Interesting thing is that the other controls (TextBoxes, NumericUpDowns) work fine.</p>

<p>Here are the Details:</p>

<p>I have a ComboBox which I bind to the ComboItem object like this:</p>

<pre><code>ComboBox comboBox = new ComboBox();
List&lt;ComboItem&gt; items = new List&lt;ComboItem&gt;();
ComboList comboList = Configuration.ComboList.LoadComboList();

Combo myCombo = comboList.GetCombo(control.MemberName);
if (myCombo != null)
{
    items.Add(new ComboItem(0, """", 0.0, 0.0));
    for (int index = 0; index &lt; myCombo.ComboItems.Count; index++)
    {
        items.Add(myCombo.ComboItems[index]);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>where Combo and ComboList are custom classes for loading the data from configuration file. Then I set the Display and Value members and also DataSource as well:</p>

<pre><code>comboBox.DisplayMember = ""Text"";
comboBox.ValueMember = ""Key"";
comboBox.DataSource = items;
</code></pre>

<p>""Text"" and ""Key"" are members of ComboItem class:</p>

<pre><code>public class ComboItem
{
    public int Key { get; set; }
    public string Text { get; set; }
    public double Coef1 { get; set; }
    public double Coef2 { get; set; } 

    public void CopyValues() {...}
    public override bool Equals() {...}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the problem: when executing undo I check everything needed to have all the cast operations safe and clear and trying to ""undo"" with this code:</p>

<pre><code>Logger.Info(controls[0], op, ""ExecuteUndo"");
((ComboBox)controls[0]).Focus();
((ComboBox)controls[0]).SelectedItem = (ComboItem)op.GetOldValue();
Logger.Info(controls[0], ""AFTER CHANGE"");
</code></pre>

<p>Logger is just logging. op object is taken from undo sequence and it gives appropriate value using ""GetOldValue()"". That code actually IS AFFECTING the UI, but until the control loses its focus. It happens on next undo which should affect other control and thus let this combobox to lose the focus.</p>

<p>I am sure that this happens on comboBox_LostFocus event because first thing I do on this event is Logging and it already shows me the value that SHOULDN'T BE.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have a hash or array of file handles for each <code>groupI</code>, pointing to very large tab-delimited text files <code>fileJ</code>, each several hundreds of MB in size. </p></li>
<li><p>I would like to loop through the file handles, reading in one tab-delimited line at a time. <em>I cannot read all the files' lines into memory.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Once I finish looping through the file handles, I then would like to <code>split</code> each line, grab a specific column of data from each split-array (fifth field, for example), and merge the data into a line of output.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>I will then end up with <code>groupA/mergedOutput.mtx</code>, <code>groupB/mergedOutput.mtx</code>, etc.</p>

<p>The problem is that I don't know how to do steps 2 and 3 correctly. </p>

<p>Here is the code I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use File::Glob qw(glob);

my @groups = qw(groupA groupB groupC);
my ($mergedOutputFn, %fileHandles);

foreach my $group (@groups) {
    $mergedOutputFn = ""$group/mergedOutput.mtx"";

    # Step 1:
    # Make hash table of file handles

    foreach my $inputFn (&lt;""$group/*.txt""&gt;) {
        open my $handle, '&lt; $inputFn' or die ""could not open $inputFn\n"";
        $fileHandles{$inputFn} = $handle;
    }

    # Steps 2 and 3:
    # Grab a line from each file handle
    # Repeat until EOF

    while(1) {
        my @mergedOutputLineElements = ();
        foreach (sort keys %handles) {
            my $handle = $handles{$_};

            push (@mergedOutputLineElements, $lineElements[4]);
            last if (! defined $line); # jump out of while loop
        }
        print Dumper join(""\t"", @mergedOutputLineElements);
    }

    # Step 4:
    # Close handles

    foreach (sort keys %handles) {
        close $handles{$_};
    }

<p>One issue seems to be that the following code doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (sort keys %handles) {
    my $handle = $handles{$_};
    my $line = &lt;$handle&gt;;
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I try to print out the value of <code>$line</code>, then I get a <code>GLOB</code> value:</p>

<pre><code>print Dumper $line;
...
GLOB(0x1d769f80)
</code></pre>

<p>How am I mishandling <code>$line</code>, or is there an easier way to do this within Perl?</p>

<p>Here is the fixed code:</p>

    open MERGE, ""&gt; $mergedOutputFn"" or die ""could not open handle to $mergedOutputFn\n"";

    # Step 1:

"24097259","1","24097995","","2014-06-07 12:36:18","","2","199","<p>I'm using the Haskell FFI with a C library that defines a number of <code>struct</code> types containing members which are pointers to <code>double</code>s, intended to be treated as arrays of <code>double</code>s:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct Foo {
  int length;
  double* values;
} FooT;
</code></pre>

<p>In my Haskell bindings to this library I have an equivalent data type in which I'm trying to use <code>Data.Vector.Storable.Vector Double</code> for the array:</p>

<pre><code>data Foo = Foo {
  length :: Int,
  values :: Data.Vector.Storable.Vector Double
} deriving (Show, Eq)
</code></pre>

<p>In order to marshall data between the C library and my Haskell code, of course, I have to write <code>Storable</code> instances for these types. I'm trying to work out a way of using <code>Data.Vector.Storable.unsafeFromForeignPtr</code> to create Haskell <code>Vector</code>s from the <code>double*</code> arrays that the C library has allocated and populated on the heap. I'm hoping that by doing this I can avoid copying the contents of the <code>double*</code> arrays and just have the <code>Vector</code> as a kind of wrapper over the array. (Side question would be: given that the <code>double*</code> arrays can be up to 10,000s of <code>double</code>s, is it worth pursuing this non-copying?)</p>

<p>This is what I have so far. I'm using <code>hsc2hs</code> macros to help generate the <code>Storable peek</code> implementation:</p>

<pre><code>instance Storable Foo where
  alignment _ = alignment (undefined :: CDouble)
  sizeOf _ = #{size FooT}

  peek ptr = do
    len &lt;- (#peek FooT, length) ptr
    valuesField &lt;- ((#peek FooT, values) ptr) :: IO (ForeignPtr Double)
    let values' = DV.unsafeFromForeignPtr0 valuesField len

    return Foo { length = len, values = values' }

  poke ptr (Foo len values') = do
    (#poke FooT, length) ptr len
    DV.unsafeWith values' (\ptrValues -&gt; (#poke FooT, values) ptr ptrValues)
</code></pre>

<p>So in my <code>peek</code> I'm trying to <code>#peek</code> the <code>values</code> member as a <code>ForeignPtr Double</code> which I could then use with <code>unsafeFromForeignPtr</code>. However, <code>#peek</code> generates code like this:</p>

<pre><code>valuesField &lt;- (((\ hsc_ptr -&gt; peekByteOff hsc_ptr 16)) ptr) :: IO (ForeignPtr Double)
</code></pre>

<p>and gets stuck because there's no <code>Storable</code> instance for <code>ForeignPtr Double</code>. I think if I tried to implement an instance for <code>ForeignPtr Double</code> I would just be commuting the problem of how to access the address value of a <code>struct</code> member to the <code>peek</code> implementation for that instance.</p>

<p>So in summary, how can I access an address value (i.e. pointer) <code>struct</code> member in such a way that I can use it as an argument to <code>unsafeFromForeignPtr</code>?</p>

<p>either:</p>

<p>-handler stops (whcich i doubt)- I have now confirmed it works and every swecond it does the procedure, so it's down to second issue</p>

<p>Is it possible to define a function's type signature so that it accepts nested types with arbitrary depth? I am looking for the behaviour of type synonyms (NOT newtype) but identifying nested/recursive types. </p>

<p>For example a function defined as <code>f :: NestedList a -&gt; b</code> should be able to be called with <code>[a]</code>, <code>[[a]]</code>, <code>[[[a]]]</code>... and so on.</p>

<h2>Long Question (original):</h2>

<p>Since it is impossible to use type synonyms in Haskell with recursive types, is there a solution for the following problem?</p>

<p>I need a synonym like <code>NestedList a</code> that would identify <code>[a]</code>, <code>[[a]]</code>, <code>[[[a]]]</code>... and so on, in function type definitions. An example of function needed to be implemented is:</p>

<pre><code>   flatten :: NestedList a -&gt; [a]
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5994051/is-there-a-function-to-flatten-a-nested-list-of-elements"">This post</a> shows a solution for <code>flatten</code> using the MultiParamTypeClasses language extension, but it does not particularly solve my problem. I need to define functions outside of a class.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p><code>flatten</code> is just an example for a function definition, I am not interested in the function as such. I need a mechanism to define a function with <code>NestedList a</code> and call it with a parameter like <code>[[a]]</code> or <code>[[[a]]]</code>, without the need of an additional type constructor, get methods, etc. As suggested in the title, I need something that behaves like a type synonym on nested lists, mainly for giving type signatures for functions that work on <code>[...[a]...]</code> while making sure the base type is <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>According to Haskell's strong-typed system this is impossible and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8963376/why-dont-type-synonyms-permit-recursion-in-haskell"">this post</a> sheds some light on the reasons why. I am just asking if there is a macro/synonym like mechanism or workaround, or a language extension that permits me to do that.</p>

Once a row has four buttons it moves on to the next row. I am having trouble doing this using a knockout observable array to represent my data. The code I have below produces one row for each button, but I would like a row to have four buttons before moving to the next row. Is there a way to do this given the way my data is organized?</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
     &lt;tbody data-bind=""foreach: chosenModelData"" id=""timesteps""&gt;
          &lt;tr&gt;
             &lt;td&gt;&lt;button class=""btn btn-default"" data-bind=""attr: {disabled: $data[2]}, 
                text: $data[0], click: $parent.load_image""&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
     &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Excerpt from my JS file:</p>

<pre><code>for(var i = 0; i &lt; json.images[0].length; i++) {
    self.chosenModelData.push([timestep[i], imgpath[i], false]);
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&lt;table id=""mytable""&gt;
       &lt;tbody data-bind=""foreach: chosenModelData"" id=""timesteps""&gt;
             &lt;!-- ko if: $index() % 4 === 0 || $index() === 0--&gt;

Our current assumption is that the beam's spot shape is somewhat gaussian.</p>

<p>We have a picoammeter hooked up to a detector that outputs that current corresponding to the number of electrons that hit the detector.  The detector is circular with some radius, R.  </p>

<p>If I'm not mistaken, sweeping the beam and recording readings from the picoammeter will result in an matrix that is the convolution of the beam spot shape and a 2D step function that's 0 outside of R and non-zero inside R.  I have looked through a few previous questions about deconvolutions related to images with a gaussian blur and it seems like this is very similar except the function is a step function instead of a gaussian.</p>

<p>I have tried using Matlab's conv2, FFT2, and iFFT2 functions to get the deconvolution <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19150516/2d-deconvolution-using-fft-in-matlab-problems"">as this thread suggests</a>, but it produces something looking like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Qaqr.png"" alt=""Deconvolution Attempt""></p>

<p>The code that produced this is:</p>

<pre><code>mu = [0 0]; 
Sigma = [1 0; 0 1]; 
x = -3:.2:3;
[X1,X2] = meshgrid(x,x);
F = mvnpdf([X1(:) X2(:)],mu,Sigma);
F = reshape(F,length(x),length(x));
for i=1:31
    for j=1:31 
        if x(i)^2+x(j)^2 &gt;= 4 
            circ(i,j)=0; 
        else
            circ(i,j)=1; 
        end 
    end 
end 
conv = conv2(F,circ,'same');
D = ifft2( fft2(conv) ./ fft2(circ) ); 
surf(x1,x2,D);
</code></pre>

<p>Is there something inherently wrong with trying to deconvolves a step function?  Also, I tried using the full convolution, but that seemed to produce an even weirder deconvolution...</p>

<p>Am I just going about this the wrong way? (I've included python because I would prefer to use python if a solution exists, but matlab is fine too)</p>

"26049423","1","","","2014-09-25 22:53:41","","1","77","<p>I had some time and thought about an event-based programming language. By that I mean a language where every variable is updated, when you change a dependent variable. For example consider the following pseudo-code for a terminal-application:</p>

<pre><code>int a = 5
int b = a + 5

// event which is called every 5 seconds
every 5 seconds =&gt;
{
     // update a by adding 5
     a &lt;&lt; a + 5
}

// event which is called when the user presses enter
on enter =&gt;
{
    println(""b = "" + b)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Pressing enter will print the value of <strong>b</strong>. But the result will be <strong>10</strong> only for the first five seconds, because after that <strong>a</strong> will be updated to <strong>10</strong> and for the next five seconds <strong>b</strong> will equal <strong>15</strong>, because <strong>b</strong> depends on <strong>a</strong>.</p>

<p>This concept will bring certain problems, of course, but it also offers some benefits. Imagine for example a GUI-application (which is normally programmed with events), which shows two inputboxes and the result of adding the two numbers:</p>

<pre><code>-------------     -------------
| 5         |  +  | 6         | = 11
-------------     -------------
</code></pre>

<p>It could be programmed in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>// two inputboxes and a label
Textbox tb1 = new TextBox() { format = ""numeric"", value = 5 }
Label lbl1_plus = new Label() { value = ""+"" }
Textbox tb2 = new TextBox() { format = ""numeric"", value = 6 }

// and the result
Label lbl1_plus = new Label() { value = ""= "" + (tb1.value + tb2.value) }
</code></pre>

<p>Thats it. It is a little bit like excel, but with real programming.
Is there a programming language like this? Or something similar?</p>

<pre><code>void foo(int(__stdcall *callback)());
</code></pre>

<p>The two main pitfalls with C function pointer callbacks are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not being able to store bind expressions </li>
<li>Not being able to store capturing lambdas </li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to know the best way to wrap functions like these to do so. The first is particularly useful for a member function callback, and the second for an inline definition that uses surrounding variables, but those are not the only uses.</p>

<p>The other property of these particular function pointers is that they need to use the <code>__stdcall</code> calling convention. This, to my knowledge, eliminates lambdas as an option completely, and is a bit of a nuisance otherwise. I'd like to allow at least <code>__cdecl</code> as well.</p>

<p>This is the best I am able to come up with without things starting to bend back to relying on support that function pointers don't have. It would typically be in a header. Here is the following example on <a href=""http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/view?id=d3222865b8c912f23dbe130e9a8bb6d3-3afcc3bc1f2cd10b247c33a6cde9edad"">Coliru</a>.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;functional&gt;

//C function in another header I have no control over
extern ""C"" void foo(int(__stdcall *callback)()) {
    callback();
}

namespace detail {
    std::function&lt;int()&gt; callback; //pretend extern and defined in cpp

    //compatible with the API, but passes work to above variable
    extern ""C"" int __stdcall proxyCallback() { //pretend defined in cpp
        //possible additional processing
        return callback();
    }
}

template&lt;typename F&gt; //takes anything
void wrappedFoo(F f) {
    detail::callback = f;
    foo(detail::proxyCallback); //call C function with proxy 
}

int main() {
    wrappedFoo([&amp;]() -&gt; int {
        return 5;
    });   
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is, however, a major flaw. This is not re-entrant. If the variable is reassigned to before it's used, the old function will never be called (not taking into account multithreading issues).</p>

<p>One thing I have tried that ended up doubling back on itself was storing the <code>std::function</code> as a data member and using objects, so each would operate on a different variable, but there was no way to pass the object to the proxy. Taking the object as a parameter would cause the signature to mismatch and binding it would not let the result be stored as a function pointer.</p>

<p>One idea I have, but have not played around with is a vector of <code>std::function</code>. However, I think the only real safe time to erase from it would be to clear it when nothing is using it. However, each entry is first added in <code>wrappedFoo</code>, then used in <code>proxyCallback</code>. I'm wondering if a counter that is incremented in the former and decremented in the latter, then checked for zero before clearing the vector would work, but it sounds like a more convoluted solution than necessary anyway.</p>

<p>Is there any way to wrap a C function with a function pointer callback such that the C++ wrapped version:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allows any function object</li>
<li>Allows more than just the C callback's calling convention (if it's critical that it's the same, the user can pass in something with the right calling convention)</li>
<li>Is thread-safe/re-entrant</li>
</ul>

<p><sub>Note: The obvious solution, stated as part of Mikael Persson's answer, is to make use of the <code>void *</code> parameter that should exist. However, this is sadly not a be-all, end-all option, mostly due to incompetence. What possibilities exist for those functions that do not have this option is where this can get interesting, and is the primary route to a very useful answer.</sub></p>

<pre><code>PARTY

<p><code>PARTY</code> table holds records of both Buyer and Supplier. Buyer will have one or more child-buyers(referred by <code>PARENT_ID</code> column by child-buyer) and those child-buyers can have child-buyers in turn.</p>

<p>Each buyer can have one or more suppliers as well and this association tracked in <code>PARTY_PARTY</code> table, where <code>BUYER_ID</code> column holds buyer id and <code>SUPPLIER_ID</code> column holds his supplier id.</p>

<p>I am able to get all buyers and suppliers of given buyer like this</p>

<p>I have two tables, <code>matters</code> and <code>users</code>. The <code>users</code> table contains user accounts - actual users of the system. The <code>matters</code> table contains data similar to like an scheduled appointment, or something of that nature.</p>

<p>The <code>matters</code> table has a foreign key to <code>users</code>, in a column named <code>manager</code>. This column just says ""hey, this <code>users</code> row specifies the <code>manager</code> of this <code>matter</code>."" This is an optional key - a matter does not have to have a manager.</p>

<p>The model for the records in <code>users</code> does not need a property that maps back to these matters.</p>

<p>My current attempt at the mapping looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Matter&gt;().HasOptional(m =&gt; m.ProjectManager).WithRequired().Map(m =&gt; m.MapKey(""project_manager""));

<p>With that, I am trying to say that <code>Matter</code> has an optional FK, on the model's <code>ProjectManager</code> property, and that the user is required to exist, and that the column name, in the <code>matters</code> table is called <code>project_manager</code>.</p>

<p>This isn't working though, and the generated SQL is incorrect, but I can't figure out how to get what I'm looking for. If I were to write the SQL it'd look something like this</p>

It all works fine, except when using the program extensively (I simulated 1000-10000 compiler executions). The memory usage rises and rises, it looks like there is a memory leak.</p>

<p>In my program, the class gets loaded, the constructor gets executed and the class gets unloaded (no remaining instance and the classLoader becomes invalid as I set the pointer to null). I analyzed the process with JConsole, the classes get unloaded when the garbage collector is executed. </p>

<p>I did a heapdum opened it in memory analyzer, the problem seems to be inside of java.net.FactoryURLClassLoader (in a com.sun.tools.javac.util.List Object). Since (com.sun.tools.javac) is part of the JDK and not in the JRE and the SystemToolClassLoader is an FactoryURLClassLoader Object, I would locate the leak somewhere there. The number of loaded classes in the SystemToolClassLoader rises from 1 to 521 when I execute the compiler the first time but stays the same afterwards. </p>

<p>So I have no idea where the leak is , is there a way to reset the SystemToolClassLoader? How could I locate the leak more precisely.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Okay I found out it also occurs in a very very simple example. So it seems to be a part of the compilation, i don't need to load the class or instantiate it:</strong></p>

<p>The constructor for MyForm is:</p>

<pre><code>MyForm()

}
</code></pre>

<p>But I encountered an error today which makes me think that as my constructor had not finished completing, it creates a new instance of MyForm to pass into MyData.  Thus it calls the constructor twice.  I found that a static list in MyFormCalcs was being filled twice and was failing the second time as the keys were already present in the list.</p>

<p>Can I use this in the constructor to refer to this instance? What will it contain in the lower class - has the constructor been run or not. </p>

<p>What is a better way of passing my form into the lower class?</p>

I can redirect all page with some condition.For example redirecting to new landing pages if request URLs contain some keywords.
But i can not redirect home page URLs to new URL. When i redirect home page to new URL, other redirect conditions not work.</p>

<p>This is my code in .htaccess file.If i remove first line, My redirect works fine! But without redirecting home page.</p>

<p>Another problem is my condition just work for exact match URLs. If any character exist after and before my keywords, The redirects not work.</p>

The gist:  The script is designed to search the python directory for all available modules (whether they are installed or not), then it is suppose to check what modules are currently loaded, then it offers an option to dynamically load a module of your choice - using '<strong>__<em>import</em>__</strong>() because I am passing a string to it - (this is where I am having a problem - but I'll get back to it shortly)...then it gives the option to ""browse"" the module for all its classes, functions, etc. (using dir([module name]) ...).</p>

<p>The problem:</p>

<p><strong>when the module is loaded dynamically - it is embedded in a try/except statement - if it succeeds it reports that the ""module is loaded"" and if it fails it reports...duh...""Failed to load...""</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you type the name of a module, for example a module named ""uu"", it says ""loaded"".  So I know it is loading - however, when I go back and call the function that checks all of the LOADED modules - it is blank (using sys.modules)</strong></p>

<p>I am thinking that python is loading the module into a temporary place which is not sys.modules because when I exit out of the script and check sys.modules it is not there.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated...</p>

<p>for the script - it wont entirely because it requires a module/script that I borrowed from someone else.  But you can see the calls I am using from the standard library in the menu options 2, 3, and 4.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Static methods are inherited just as any other method and follow the same inheritance rules about access modifiers (private methods are not inherited etc.)</p>

<p>Static methods are not over-ridden they are redefined. If a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as one in the superclass, it is said to be shadowing or hiding the superclass's version not over-riding it since they are not polymorphic as instance methods.</p>

<p>The redefined static methods still seem to be following some of (if not all) of the over-riding rules. </p>

<p><strong>Firstly</strong>, the re-defined static method cannot be more access restricted than the superclass's static method. Why??</p>

<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, the return types must also be compatible in both the superclass's and subclass's method. For example:</p>

<pre><code>class Test2 {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println(""Test2 static show"");
    }
}

public class StaticTest extends Test2 {
    static StaticTest show() {
        System.out.println(""StaticTest static show"");
        return new StaticTest();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>In eclipse it shows an error at line at:
<code>The return type is incompatible with Test2.show()</code>
Why??</p>

<p>And <strong>Thirdly</strong>, are there any other rules that are followed in re-defining static methods which are same as the rules for over-riding, and what is the reason for those rules?</p>

<p>Thanx in advance!!</p>

<p>For example: I want to be able to load up a Plugin (simple, just defined via a specific interface) within a separate Assembly within an ASP.NET application, but I only want the plugin to be able to access certain Data Access Layer component and not be able to connect to any databases directly.

Let's call it <code>SecondEntity</code>. There is a requirement that when the entity is persisted its field <code>dateInserted</code> is set to the current date (in practice the requirements may be more complex - I want to know if the concept is OK or if I am going totally in the wrong direction).</p>

<p>Now I define a new entity - let's call it <code>FirstEntity</code> - which contains <code>SecondEntity</code> as an attribute. I implement another EJB which implements a method for persisting <code>FirstEntity</code> - so each time <code>FirstEntity</code> is persisted, <code>SecondEntity</code> must be persisted too. I know I can use <code>@ManyToOne(optional = false, cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)</code> on the <code>secondEntity</code> attribute in <code>FirstEntity</code> (that would do auto persist). But remember, there is a <code>dateInserted</code> requirement and logic is already implemented. The idea is to reuse the already implemented method for persisting <code>SecondEntity</code> in <code>SecondController</code> by injecting it into <code>FirstController</code>.</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class SecondEntity implements Serializable
{
}

@Entity 
public class FirstEntity implements Serializable
{
    @JoinColumn(name = ""second_id"", referencedColumnName = ""second_id"")
    @ManyToOne(optional = false)
    private SecondEntity secondEntity;
}

public class SecondController implements Serializable
{
    @PersistenceUnit(name = ""PU"")

    public SecondController()

    }

    {
        EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();

        try
        {
            secondEntity.setDateInserted(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()));
            em.persist(secondEntity);
        }

        finally
        {
            em.close();
        }
    }
}

@Stateless
public class FirstController implements Serializable

    @PersistenceUnit(name = ""PU"")

    }


    public void create(FirstEntity firstEntity)
    {
        EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();

        try
        {
            secondController.create(firstEntity.getSecondEntity());
            em.persist(firstEntity);

        {
            em.close();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The point of the sample code above is to call <code>secondController.create(firstEntity.getSecondEntity())</code>. Is this OK or is it considered a bad practice? I have two such cases in my application and one works (<code>SecondEntity</code> is optional - can be <code>null</code>), and one which does not (<code>SecondEntity</code> is mandatory - cannot be <code>null</code>). The code fails at <code>em.persist(firstEntity)</code> by saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>java.lang.IllegalStateException: During synchronization a new object was found through a relationship that was not marked cascade PERSIST</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I replace the mentioned call with <code>em.persist(firstEntity.getSecondEntity)</code> the code works fine.</p>

<p>How can I solve this problem?</p>

<p>I know of two posts which I've seen about this...</p>

<p>This one - forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/142038/317146.aspx doesn't help as I've tried forcing a GC to no avail, and this one - <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2692737/automatically-calling-ondetaching-for-silverlight-behaviors"">Automatically calling OnDetaching() for Silverlight Behaviors</a> I don't really get their explination as they claim its the hooking up of the UIElement to the behaviour that causes it, but surely when the root reference UIElement is broken, the root reference to the behaviour will be removed too and consequently both become eligable for GC.</p>

<p>I was hoping this'd be simple, but if not I'll get started with WinDbg to see what's actually going on!</p>

<p>Any help is much appreciated! :)</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

(The error is that a certain transient DOM element for the animation is not in the page, when it should actually be there.)</p>

<p>this flickering goes away.  I'm worried that this is somehow bad form/hackish and might cause more problems than it solves.  Does anyone have any experience in this area?  Is there a better solution?</p>

<p>Without storecodes the redirects only work when the last opened store is the one it should redirect to. 
e.g. domain2.com/en/product2 to domain2.com/product2 works if the last opened store was ""eng"". If the last opened store was ""nld"" I get a 404.</p>

<p>With storecodes the redirects from domain2.com give a 404, but the site suddenly has the design of domain1.com</p>

<p>Looking at the <code>""java.lang.OutOfMemoryError""</code> and <code>""StateListDrawable.java:173""</code> it seems to be somehow related to the ImageView background state. 
How is this happening? I do keep references to the imageview in my fragment but I set them to null in onDestroyView. What might I be doing wrong? </p>

<p>PS. No context saved anywhere.</p>

<p>In general, the member function (and therefore, the parent thread) that launched the daughter thread can continue or it can return.  In every case where I use this technique, I let the launcher method just return to the app in the parent thread that called it; something like Qt threads.</p>

<p>When the daughter thread has finished its work, the final thing it does is return into the friend function which itself returns to something waiting to catch its return (pthread_koin or WaitForSingleEvent) or, if there is no catcher, I guess you'd say it returns to nowhere.  </p>

<p>So, here is the question.  If there is no catcher for the return from the friend function, that is, the parent thread is not in a member function, can I safely destroy the object that launched the child thread from the friend function?</p>

<p>Obvious from the responses, I need an example.  We'll go for Windows.  Not that different from Linux.  I have left out lots of stuff, the class definition, etc.</p>

<li>Main calls so->run() and goes off to do other stuff.  </li>
<li>Run() launches the daughter thread that runs SomeFriend(). </li>
<li>SomeFriend() calls so->Worker()  (that == so)</li>
<li>Worker() does whatever and returns to SomeFriend(). </li>
<li>CAN I DELETE so HERE?  i.e. <code>delete that</code>  &lt;&lt;&lt;=== the subject of this question.</li>
<li>SomeFriend() returns terminating the daughter thread.</li>

<p>Lets assume that <code>Item_A</code> contains <code>Item_B</code> which contains <code>Item_C</code> as it is shown above.

Consider now that something happens to an an object shown as <code>Item_B</code> (e.g name change). Then of course both items
must be updated. Consider now thousands of items in the treeview with complex hierarchies. What strategy would you use to update the treeview? Speed is of course the main concern here but also ease of use and maintenance. Currently I hold internal mappings of list items to objects and vice-versa to find and update items quickly. Is that a correct strategy? By recreating the list after each update I can throw lots of code away, but I wouldn't know which item paths were expanded or collapsed. How could I solve this problem? Should I store expanded paths in an internal container? </p>

<p>PS : What I want is just to reach the text that the webpage provides. For example, if the webpages is only providing a div and a img object with a simple link, I just need that link and nothing more.</p>

I have simple application with 4 views which just displays a bunch of data. I am testing performance of my application on various devices and thought turning off animations would be one of the test cases to follow. </p>

<p>I tried several ways, such as: (caution: these are all the solutions I found on the internet, some of them might not make sense. I am still learning the framework :) </p>

<p><strong>Trial I:</strong> (in launch function)</p>

<pre><code>Ext.override(Ext.Window, {
            animShow: function(){
                this.afterShow();
            },
            animHide: function(){
                this.el.hide();
                this.afterHide();
            }
        });
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Trial II:</strong> (in launch function, replacing Trial I)</p>

<pre><code>Ext.Anim.override({
            disableAnimations:true
        });
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Trial III:</strong> (inside my view class)</p>

<pre><code>config: {
        showAnimation: false,
        hideAnimation: false,
        navigationBar: {
            hidden   : false,
            animation: false
        },
        items: [
            {
                xtype: 'logincard',
                flex : 1
            }
        ]
    }
</code></pre>

<p>However, I could turn off animation in navigation bar using: (in my view class as well)</p>

<pre><code>navigationBar: {
                hidden   : false,
                animation: false
            }
</code></pre>

<p>So is there someway of totally disabling the page transition animation in Sencha Touch 2.2.1? </p>

<p>Any help would be highly appreciated!</p>

Basically now, after user login with mobile number and a code sent by SMS, the authentication server returns an access token that will be used for accessing to all apis. For the authentication server, I've used Laravel with jwt-auth library.
When the access token will expired I will ask a new one using the credential of user stored in the AccountManager.
Is it the correct way to implement this authentication?</p>

<p>Or I'm missing the refresh token, which I ask a new access token when this expired?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,
Daniele</p>
