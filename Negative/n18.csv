At <code>./manage.py syncdb</code> time, a <code>ContentType</code> with a name ""<strong>blog post</strong>"" is created automatically. At some later point of time, <code>Meta.verbose_name</code> of ""<strong>Blog post</strong>"" is added.</p>

<p>Now there is a discrepancy: <code>ContentType</code> is called ""<strong>blog post</strong>"", while the model goes by verbose name of ""<strong>Blog post</strong>"", this difference is shown in any framework using generic relationships, e.g. in comments' admin. I would like to correct this situation by changing the name of the <code>ContentType</code>, however, I wouldn't want to do that either by hand (for obvious reasons) or via a migration (since I don't migrate anything else, <code>Meta.verbose_name</code> is just a code change).</p>

<p>How would you update the <code>ContentType</code>'s name upon <code>Meta.verbose_name</code> change?</p>

"18195943","1","","","2013-08-12 20:17:11","","0","772","<p>All I want is for each list to toggle in and out when you click the span that precedes it. What happens now is that clicking one span toggles all the lists. I'm a jQuery beginner, but I feel like this is a really simple thing to do, so I'm frustrated that I can't figure it out. Also, there will be a LOT of these on the page, so I don't want to have to add a bunch of code for each new list.</p>

<p>This is my HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class=""rental""&gt;123 Main Street&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul class=""rental-det""&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 bedrooms&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1 bathroom&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;New carpets throughout&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All large kitchen appliances included&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In-unit washer and dryer&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Central air&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Dishwasher&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Renter responsible for all utilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;span class=""rental""&gt;321 Main Street&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul class=""rental-det""&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 bedrooms&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1 bathroom&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;New carpets throughout&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All large kitchen appliances included&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In-unit washer and dryer&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Central air&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Dishwasher&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Renter responsible for all utilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, again, I want to be able to click each span with a class of ""rental"" and toggle the list that immediately follows it.</p>

<p>Here is the jQuery I have been using:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
$('.rental').click(function() {
$('.rental-det').slideToggle()
});
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>I have also added <code>display: none;</code> to the .rental-det class to make them hidden by default.</p>

<pre><code>const char &amp;ToBoolean(bool val) const 
{ 
    return val ? (const char &amp;)""1"" : (const char &amp;)""0""; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>, but when using <code>inline</code> I'm guessing this should be ok since the literal's scope is now in the calling function, or no? Example:</p>

<pre><code>inline const char &amp;ToBoolean(bool val) const 
{ 
    return val ? (const char &amp;)""1"" : (const char &amp;)""0""; 
}

<p>This is how I plan to use it:</p>

<pre><code>void testToBoolean1()
{
     bool val = true;
     const char *valStr = ToBoolean(val);
     int result = strcmp(""1"", valStr);
     CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL(0, result);

<p>If static strings are ok, then how about this?</p>

<pre><code>inline const char *ToBoolean(bool val) const { 
    char boolStr[6];
    if (val) strcpy(boolStr, ""true"");
    else strcpy(boolStr, ""false"");
    return &amp;boolStr;

<p>Up to 640 x 480? That's weird. Am I misinterpreting that? How would I play videos of a higher resolution?</p>

<p>What's also weird is that lowering the resolution of the video to 1840 x 1376 plays the video, but anything higher and I am unable to play it on the device. It seems to me that the device may be running in to some memory trouble, but I'm sure this can be done. How does Apple play, say, HD trailers or movies downloaded from iTunes?</p>

<p>This workflow is used for orchestration of other workflow services. It literally needs to run forever - but we need the ability to shut it down softly. Previously I had this same type of thing implemented in a State Machine, the Delay was the trigger for one transition and the Receive was the trigger for another. As long as the first mentioned transition wasn't running I was able to get the Receive to take the message and transition to the final state. Here what I want to do, as you can see, is just set the boolean value to False indicating that the While loop should exit and thus the workflow would terminate.</p>

<p>Please help me understand why this isn't working.</p>

<pre><code>class BaseSession : public boost::enable_shared_from_this&lt;BaseSession&gt;

<p>Within the derived class functions, I regularly call functions like this:</p>

<pre><code>Func(boost::dynamic_pointer_cast&lt;DerivedSessionA&gt;(shared_from_this()));
</code></pre>

<p>Since I was working with <code>shared_ptr</code> to manage the sessions, this was working fine. Recently, I discovered that my use of <code>shared_ptr</code> is not optimal for this case. That is because these sessions are singleton objects that maintain one socket per client. If socket is reconnected, the session copies used to become zombies.</p>

<p>As workaround, I started passing <code>shared_ptr</code> by reference rather than copies. This solved the zombie problem.</p>

<p>Ideally, I felt I should be using <code>unique_ptr</code> to store the session and then pass references to other functions. That opened a whole can of worms.</p>

<p>How do I cast a base class <code>unique_ptr</code> object to derived class <code>unique_ptr</code> object? What is the <code>unique_ptr</code> version of the following line?</p>

But I have an issue there in special case, when a dataset has an attribute, what is ""null"". So the dataset will not be found although it should found cos it matches on one attibute.</p>

<p>The situtation in beginning is like follows. You see there is a dataset with apprentice Fabio Bartels, who has not Fachrichtung. And a dataset with Viktoria.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/tElxy.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now when I search for Viktoria, the filter works as expected:</p>

<p>When I search for Fabio, then Dataset is not found:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LnsXN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>=====</p>

<p>The problem I have is, that I don't know how to handle the filter, that a attribute will only be validated against the search string when the attribute is not null.</p>

<p>=====</p>

<p>Serverside Java Classes see like follows:</p>

<p><strong>QueryClass:</strong></p>

<pre><code>class ContractSearchQuery {

private static QContract contract = QContract.contract;

static BooleanExpression getPredicate(final ContractSearch filter) {
    BooleanExpression predicate;

    if (filter == null || filter.isEmpty()) {
        // SHOW ALL PREDICATE ...
    } else {
        final String search = filter.getSearch();

        final List&lt;BooleanExpression&gt; expressions = new ArrayList&lt;BooleanExpression&gt;();

        // EXPRESSIONS CURRENTLY ONLY ON AUSZUBILDENDER AND FACHRICHTUNG
        // FOR SHOWCASE
        expressions.add(containsApprenticeName(search)); // AUSZUBILDENDER
        expressions.add(containsSpecialisation(search)); // FACHRICHTUNG

        BooleanExpression expression = expressions.get(INTEGER_ZERO);
        for (int i = 1; i &lt; expressions.size(); i++) {
            expression = expression.or(expressions.get(i));
        }

        predicate = expression;
    }
    return predicate;
}

private static BooleanExpression containsApprenticeName(final String search) {
    final BooleanExpression expLastName = contract.apprentice.lastName.containsIgnoreCase(search);
    final BooleanExpression expFirstName = contract.apprentice.firstName.containsIgnoreCase(search);
    return expLastName.or(expFirstName);
}

private static BooleanExpression containsSpecialisation(final String search) {
    return contract.companyOccupationCombination.occupationCombination.specialisation.name.containsIgnoreCase(search);
}

<p>}</p>

<p><strong>Spring-Data-Repository Call:</strong></p>

<pre><code>final PageRequest pageRequest = new PageRequest(firstResult / maxResults, maxResults, orderSort);
final Page&lt;Contract&gt; page = contractRepository.findAll(predicate, pageRequest);
return page.getContent();
</code></pre>

<p>=======</p>

<p><strong>Database:</strong></p>

<p>By the way I recognized when I do direct request against my db with joining Specialisation Table, then I only get Fabio as record, when not joining Specialisation, I get all three persons. Maybe somethings to do with my issue:</p>

<pre><code>select a.first_name, a.last_name from contract c 
    join company_occupation_combination coc on c.company_occupation_combination = coc.id 
    join occupation_combination oc on coc.occupation_combination = oc.id
    join apprentice a on c.apprentice = a.id
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Result:</strong>
""Fabio"";""Bartels""
""Viktoria"";""Kruczek""
""Lina"";""Ehleiter""</p>

<p><strong>With Join:</strong></p>

<pre><code>select a.first_name, a.last_name from contract c 
    join company_occupation_combination coc on         c.company_occupation_combination = coc.id 
    join occupation_combination oc on coc.occupation_combination = oc.id
    join specialisation s on oc.specialisation = s.id 
    join apprentice a on c.apprentice = a.id
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Result:</strong>      ""Viktoria"";""Kruczek""</p>

<p>====</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Okay, on db site I found out (with Hibernate and JPA I start forgetting SQL-Basices ;-)), that I need a left join for the nullable relation, so my query should result to an sql like:</p>

<pre><code>select a.first_name, a.last_name from contract c 
join company_occupation_combination coc on c.company_occupation_combination = coc.id 
join occupation_combination oc on coc.occupation_combination = oc.id
left join specialisation s on oc.specialisation = s.id 
join apprentice a on c.apprentice = a.id
</code></pre>

<p>====</p>

<p><strong>So my question is, how can I manage left Join when I have a Query-Class using QueryDSL and Spring-Data-Repository like mentioned above?</strong></p>

Much learned so far, but I've hit a wall. The class detailed <a href=""https://dev.visucore.com/doom3/doxygen/classid_vec2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> has methods</p>

<pre><code>float  operator[] (int index) const

<pre><code>float &amp;  operator[] (int index)

<p>whose bodies both read</p>

<pre><code>return ( &amp;x )[ index ];
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>x</code> is one of the class' two data members (the other being <code>y</code>; this class is for 2-vectors). </p>

<p>While I can understand the syntax of each version's header/prototype, I don't get why they're both present. </p>

<p><code>const</code> seems to appear (or not appear, as preferred) only to distinguish the headers sufficiently to allow compilation. (That is, remove <code>const</code> and VS2010 refuses to compile, similarly if both headers end in <code>const</code>.)</p>

<p>And why return a ref to a float? None of the class' seven other float-type methods do this, so I'm guessing efficiency isn't a factor (tho' maybe this operator's called vastly more often than the others).</p>

<p>Basically I have a form on an HTML page which uses jQuery AJAX to post to an ASP.NET page, which then takes the form fields and puts them into a database.</p>

<p>The form itself contains some standard fields, such as article title, article content and date.  However, the form also allows for numerous author details to be added, comprising author name, author email address, author age.  So on the form, the user fills in the form title and content fields and can add one or more authors, the fields for which are built dynamically using jQuery.clone().</p>

<p>So there is an unknown number of authors, and as a result the .NET control which accepts the form post doesn't know what fields it is due to receive.</p>

<p>The standard form details are added to one table, called 'Article'.  The authors are each individually added to a different table, called 'Author'.</p>

<p>So the question is, what is the best way to handle this type of thing?</p>

<p>Thanks for any advice here.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>To add my initial ideas to this...  Firstly, I could name each of the author form fields with an incremental number, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;fieldset&gt;
  Author 1 name: &lt;input name=""name-1"" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Author 1 email: &lt;input name=""email-1"" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Author 1 age: &lt;input name=""age-1"" /&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;
&lt;fieldset&gt;
  Author 2 name: &lt;input name=""name-2"" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Author 2 email: &lt;input name=""email-2"" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Author 2 age: &lt;input name=""age-2"" /&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And also have a hidden field called 'number-of-authors' which is incremented/decremented when new author fieldsets are added/removed by the jQuery script.  Then in the .NET code which receives the form post, I could loop through each form field from 0 to x (where x is the value of 'number-of-authors'.  The difficulty here is I'd have to re-index each of the form fields when a fieldset is removed, in case the user deletes the first set, for example.</p>

<p>My second thought is that I could use jQuery serialisation to serialise the form field values into a single string, then process that string back into an object in the .NET code.  Although I don't really know how to do this, I'm sure it would be possible.</p>

<p>What would people's advice be in this situation?</p>

    &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
&lt;/activity&gt;

</ul>

<p>The plan is, that the first application does not need internet permissions and the second is some kind of add-on to the first.</p>

<p>The second application should sync a file with Dropbox (with the Core API, not with the Sync API).</p>

<p>From my first app, I start 'MyActivity' from the second app like this:</p>

<pre><code>    Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
    intent.setComponent(new ComponentName(""my.package"",""my.package.MyActivity""));
    intent.putExtra(""filePath"", ""/myFile.txt"");
    startActivityForResult(intent, SYNC_REQUEST);
</code></pre>

<p>That works. The Activity comes up and there, if not authorized yet, the user must press a button. Then the following code will be executed</p>

<pre><code>    AndroidAuthSession session = buildSession();
    mApi = new DropboxAPI&lt;AndroidAuthSession&gt;(session);

    mApi.getSession().startAuthentication(MyActivity.this);
</code></pre>

<p>If the user does not have dropbox installed, the browser will pop up.</p>

<h2>Now my troubles begin:<br/></h2>

<p>As soon as the user presses 'Accept' or 'Decline', the browser does not disappear. It stays open and MyActivity does not get resumed (onResume is not called!).</p>

<p>I found out, that adding</p>

<pre><code>    intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
</code></pre>

<p>before starting MyActivity from my first application will solve the problem, but then I can not listen/wait for the result of MyActivity.</p>

<p>I am frustrated. Can anyone help me or give me some advise?</p>

However, my <code>test.rb</code> file, which I just put on the Go's directory in order to do test purpose, didn't import the tags file correctly.</p>

<p>Also, when I executed the <code>ctags</code> command on <code>~/another_go_workspace/src</code>, and then opened up the file located in <code>~/another_go_workspace/src/hello/hello.go</code>, then the file didn't import the tags file... However, since I appended <code>set tags=./tags,tags;$HOME</code> on my <code>~/.vimrc</code>, doesn't it automatically look for higher directories, right?</p>

<p>So what am I missing?</p>

<p>And if it doesn't import the tags file in higher directories, do I have to execute the <code>ctag</code> command on EVERY directory, i.e. on <code>~/go/src/soccer_analysis</code>, <code>~/go/src/coffee</code>, <code>~/go/src/utility</code>, etc, etc... ?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<ol>
<li>ImageList localization blows up my complex winfors very often, I don't know why but the problem is definetly on ImageList, I had to create a tool that removes the ImageStream from my localized resources in order to open correctly the form in the designer.</li>
<li>The size of compiled resources grows</li>
<li>If I add an image on the default language I have to switch all the languages to add it or I have to run my tool to remove ImageStream from resources</li>
</ol>

<p>The same question can be asked for some UserControl properties (such as usercontrol with images that should not change).</p>

I'm working on 2 different approach to do so:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new REST Service which will act as a proxy to
expose my WCF Service as REST Services (11 services / 130 web methods to
migrate...) and secure it using an IP STS / RS STS</li>
<li>Use a existing product like Apigee which will do all those job for me and even more feature than initially planned.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm trying to play with Apigee first, but I'm facing an issue while creating the API Proxy.</p>

<p>I've deployed a simple WCF Service (with only 2 methods) on a Windows Azure VM exposed in basicHttp (which works as expected - means I test it in a Console app successfully, even when the client app is located outside my Azure's VM -).</p>

<p>Problem comes when I follow the Apigee workflow to expose it as a REST Service. I try to fetch service's wsdl on Apigee portal and got following error:</p>

<p><strong>Error: Cannot invoke method getOperation() on null object</strong></p>

<p>Does someone know where the issue come from ? I don't have much information from Apigee portal.
I already validate my wsdl through <a href=""http://www.wsdl-analyzer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsdl-analyzer.com/</a> but everything looks fine...
Meantime, Amazone webservice works fine on Apigee and generate the REST Service so problem seems to come from my service's WSDL</p>

<p>I've pretty much copied the TStrings visualiser example suplied by EMBT, but am running into problems when the form is being shown, as it gives me an AV without showing any data.</p>

<p>The top part of the callstack in the AV looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>[5003C49E]{rtl150.bpl  } System.@UStrAsg (Line 17745, ""System.pas"" + 30) + $0
[149038D1]{DatasetVisualiserProject.bpl} Datasetvisualiserframe.TDatasetVisualiserFrame.ThreadNotify + $151
[20A2CA9A]{coreide150.bpl} DebuggerMgr.TDebuggerMgr.OnShowVisualizer (Line 1112, ""DebuggerMgr.pas"" + 4) + $3B
</code></pre>

<p>So it's a problem with string assignments, likely unallocated memory? Like the TStrings implementation my ThreadNotify procedure has no code in it.</p>

<p>My 'work' routine replaces the TStrings implementation's AddStringListItems call, and looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>procedure TDatasetVisualiserFrame.SetDataset(const Expression, TypeName, EvalResult: string);
var
  TempFilename: string;
begin
  FAvailableState := asAvailable;
  FExpression := Expression;
  IntDataset.Close;

  TempFileName := GetTempFile('DSDebug');
  try
    if FTypeName = TADODataset.Classname then
    begin
      Evaluate(Format('%s.SaveToFile(%s)', [FExpression, TempFileName]));

      IntDataset_ADO.LoadFromFile(TempFileName);
      srcIntDataset.DataSet := IntDataset_ADO;
    end
    else if FTypeName = TKBMMemTable.Classname then
    begin
      Evaluate(Format('%s.SaveToFile(%s)', [FExpression, TempFileName]));
      IntDataset.LoadFromFile(TempFileName);
      srcIntDataset.DataSet := IntDataset;
    end
    else raise Exception.Create('Unhandled class type ' + TypeName);
  finally
    if fileexists(TempFileName) then
    begin
      DeleteFile(TempFileName);
    end;
  end;

  DebugDatasetView.beginupdate;
  try
    DebugDatasetView.ClearItems;
    DebugDatasetView.DataController.CreateAllItems(false);
  finally
    DebugDatasetView.endupdate;
  end;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>The frame itself has a TADODataset, Datasource and a QuantumGrid component for display (though a DBGrid should work)</p>

<p>Do I need to do something with thread handling because I'm dealing with Datasets or is it something more fundamental?</p>

<p>As a bonus question: My original plan was to take a TDataset and use KBMMemTable's LoadFromDataset routine passing in the original dataset, but soon after starting I discovered I was limited to getting strings back from the debugger so this wasn't possible. Am I mistaken, or is there a tricksy way around it?</p>

When the view was loaded the nearest pin gets searched and the map will get zoomed so it shows both, the user's location and the nearest pin. I do that with <code>[map setRegion:region animated:YES];</code>. Everything works fine up to here. The same method is also called by tapping on a button which locates the user and then does exactly what I just described.</p>

<p>I also have a search field with which the user can search for map points. When the user taps on one of the search results the map sets the region so the searched pin is in the middle.
Now, there's something strange with that. I also set this region animated, at least I do the same command as above. But if the map point is too far away from the current visible part of the map it doesn't show the animation when changing the region.
Am I missing something? I've already had a look at Apples docs, they don't mention anything regarding any maximum distance for animations.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to any help!</p>

<p><br/>
<strong>Update 1:</strong><br/>
Just tested it again in the Simulator. An interesting fact is, that when I search for a <strong>MapPoint</strong> for the first time and then select a search result it doesn't animate. If I perform another search just after the first one and select a result it does animate. As soon as I tap on the locate button which brings the user back to his location and the closest point it doesn't animate for this <code>setRegion:</code> and the first search after that. But only in the Simulator, on my 4S it does exactly what I've described in the original question above.</p>

<p><br/>
<strong>Update 2:</strong><br/>
In the comments I was asked to provide example coordinates.<br/>
So here the coordinates for the first step (searching of the own location and the nearest pin):<br/>
<strong>My Location:</strong> 47.227131 / 8.264251<br/>
<strong>Nearest pin:</strong> 47.251347 / 8.357191<br/>
The distance between them is about 22 kilometers. The center of the map is the center between the two pins. The distance from the center to the screen border is 1.5 times the distance between the two points which means about 33 kilometers in this case.<br/>
And here a set of coordinates for the second step (searching a map point and selecting it):<br/>
<strong>Searched pin:</strong> 46.790680 / 9.818824<br/>
The distance to the screen border is here fixed to 500 meters.</p>

         )
</code></pre>

<p>I do not want the <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/FSCs0.png"" rel=""nofollow"">0</a> and so on.</p>

<p>Just for example, it should look like this:   </p>

<pre><code> (use print_r)
 Array ( [0] =&gt; Array ( [id] =&gt; 1 
                        [tbl1_id] =&gt; 1 
                        [tbl2_id] =&gt; 1 
                        [tbl2_tbl1id] =&gt; 1 
                        [tbl3_id] =&gt; 1 
                        [tbl2_tbl1id] =&gt; 1  ...
                      )
       )
</code></pre>

<p>or something similar. I use PDO and when it invokes sql looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM `tbl` 
  INNER JOIN (tbl2, tbll) 
   ON tbl.tbl1_id=tbl1.id 
      AND tbl.tbl2_id=tbl2.id 
WHERE 1 
</code></pre>

<p>after using it in mysql gets such an effect as in the picture(Run SQL query/queries on databas)</p>

Inside this element is the Visual element and so on so forth. My main project is pulling in the xaml file like this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window.Background&gt;
    &lt;VisualBrush Visual={DynamicResource Theme}"" /&gt;
&lt;/Window.Background
</code></pre>

<p>If I manually put the xaml code in this area it works perfect but I want the user to be able to flip through different xaml ""themes"". The problem is that right now because visualbrush in the xaml file has the key property the visual property won't convert to visualbrush... obviously... is there a way to set the visualbrush to the dynamicresource of the visualbrush element in the xaml file in resourcelibrary? This would give the effect I want to achieve. Thanks.</p>

&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(Illustrative only; the actual app does cleaner setup of its <code>ondblclick</code> event, and I know the bubbling cancel isn't cross-browser as written.)</p>

<p>The desired behaviour is that a doubleclick anywhere on or within the dashed border triggers the handler on the outer span, which tests OK in Firefox and Opera.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the target browser is IE8 or later, which (if the mouse is over a portion of the span which overlaps the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) only triggers the span <code>ondblclick</code> if the mouse is right on the dashed border or the innerspan text when the event is raised (it triggers the doc <code>ondblclick</code> instead). In our tests IE9 behaved the same way.</p>

<p>Already tried: setting <code>display:block;</code> on both spans and <code>width:100%;height:100%;</code> on the inner block; no luck. It works as required if a background colour is set on the outerspan, but unfortunately we need the background to be transparent, IE8 doesn't support RGBA for background colour, and using the gradient filter approach doesn't solve the event problem.</p>

<p>Is it possible via CSS (or the markup) to make the event work properly without resorting to a transparent background image?</p>

<p>(The ideal answer here would be a cross-browser solution, but one targeted to IE8+ is sufficient; thanks.)</p>

<p>Customer will call our client with a <code>userId</code> and we will construct a URL from that <code>userId</code> and make a HTTP call to that URL and we will get a JSON String back after hitting the URL. And after we get the response back as a JSON String, then we will send that JSON String back to our customer. </p>

<p>So in this case, as I mentioned above, I need to have <code>synchronous</code> and <code>asynchronous</code> methods, some customer will call <code>executeSynchronous</code> method to get the same feature and some customer will call our <code>executeAsynchronous</code> method to get the data back.</p>

<p>Below is my Interface - </p>

<pre><code>public interface Client {

    // for synchronous
    public String executeSynchronous(final String userId);

    // for asynchronous
    public Future&lt;String&gt; executeAsynchronous(final String userId);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then I have our <code>SmartClient</code> which implements the above <code>Client</code> interface.</p>

<pre><code>public class SmartClient implements Client {

    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

    // This is for synchronous call
    @Override
    public String execute(String userId) {

        String response = null;
        Future&lt;String&gt; handle = getHandle(userId);

        try {
            response = handle.get(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
        } catch (TimeoutException e) {

        }

        return response;
    }

    // This is for asynchronous call
    @Override
    public Future&lt;String&gt; executeAsync(String userId) {

        return getHandle(userId);

    }

    private Future&lt;String&gt; getHandle(String userId) {
        Future&lt;String&gt; future = null;

        Task task = new Task(userId);
        future = executor.submit(task);

        return future;

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Below is my simple class which will perform the actual task - </p>

<pre><code>class Task implements Callable&lt;String&gt; {

    private final String userId;

    public Task(String userId) {
        this.userId = userId;   
    }

    public String call() throws Exception {

        String url = createURL(userId);

        // make a HTTP call to the URL
        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
        String jsonResponse = restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class);

        return jsonResponse;
    }

    // create a URL
    private String createURL(String userId) {
        String generateURL = somecode;

        return generateURL;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is this the correct and efficient way of doing this problem? And how about exception handling? Do I need any other catch blocks at any places? If any, then just a high level code example will help me understand to better.</p>

I have a DB with tables; country, regions and properties [and a few more tables]
Now when I do a view for the regions to displays the properties sorted by region: for example domain.com/regions/view/33 the Paginator counts and displays information related to the regions [a total of 60 regions] and I would like to have the Paginator to show/count for the amount of properties [3 properties] in region 33, How to get this done?</p>

<p>Non-standard attributes can be fairly useful for passing along meta-data to Javascript however. For instance, if a link is suppose to show a popup, you can set the name of the popup in an attribute:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#null"" class=""popup"" title=""See the Popup!"" 
   popup_title=""Title for My Popup""&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can store the title for the popup in a hidden element, like a span:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
    .popup .title { display: none; }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;a href=""#null"" title=""See the Popup!"" class=""popup""&gt;
    click me
    &lt;span class=""title""&gt;Title for My Popup&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I am torn however as to which should be a preferred method. The first method is more concise and, I'm guessing, doesn't screw with search engines and screen readers as much. Conversely, the second option makes storing large amounts of data easier and is thus, more versatile. It is also standards compliant.</p>

<p>I am curious what this communities thoughts are. How do you handle a situation like this? Does the simplicity of the first method outweigh the potential downsides (if there are any)?</p>

<p>The only other caveat to this is that I'm attempting to get this to work within an opensource java cms called Opencms.  But not sure that's relevant as the files that I'm wiring to are vanilla java support class, not controllers or anything(not really looking to do Spring-MVC with it just yet).</p>

<p>In fact all of this works in a Spring MVC servlet-context on a seperate smaller application but I just cannot seem to get these same objects/annotations to register in the applicationContext.</p>

<p>I have three files in the following directory structure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tester.java</li>
<li>approach1\Approach.java</li>
<li>approach2\Approach.java</li>
</ul>

<p>Their code is as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Tester.java</strong></p>

<pre><code>import approach1.Approach;

public class Tester {

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        approach1.Approach.sharedMethod(""TEXT"");

        sharedMethod(""TEXT"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>approach1\Approach.java</strong></p>

<pre><code>package approach1; 

public class Approach {

    public static void sharedMethod(String approachText)
    {
        System.out.println(""Approach Text: "" + approachText);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>approach2\Approach.java</strong></p>

<pre><code>package approach2;

public class Approach {

    public static void sharedMethod(String approachText) { }

}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can likely guess, I'm trying to elicit different responses from the different approaches based on what package/class is imported. The problem I encounter is within <strong>Tester.java</strong>. The first, explicit line works fine whereas the second, imported line (sharedMethod(""TEXT"")) throws an error of <em>""The method sharedMethod(String) is undefined for the type Tester""</em>. I don't understand as I have imported one of the packages, so the method should be visible.</p>

<p>Any clarification would be appreicated as I'm a Java newb. Thanks!</p>

See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12569018/why-is-adding-attributes-to-an-already-instantiated-object-allowed-in-python"">this question</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5907937/adding-attributes-to-python-objects/"">this answer</a>, also the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Python Data model</a> reference which explains that <code>c.x</code> is (to the first approximation) equivalent to <code>c.__dict__['x']</code> and in particular <code>c.x = y</code> is equivalent to <code>c.__dict__['x'] = y</code>, and therefore one can in general add arbitrary attributes to Python objects unless it's explicitly suppressed.]</p>

<p>It seems that arbitrary attributes can be set on an object of type <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/request-response/"" rel=""nofollow"">HttpRequest</a> from <code>django.http</code> (and indeed, this is <a href=""https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/HttpRequest"" rel=""nofollow"">done</a> by various <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/middleware/"" rel=""nofollow"">middleware</a>). For instance, consider the following <code>ipython</code> session:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: from django.http import HttpRequest

In [2]: request = HttpRequest()

In [3]: request.asdf_foo = 5

In [4]: request.asdf_foo
Out[4]: 5

In [5]: setattr(request, 'asdgadshasdh', 42)

In [6]: request.asdgadshasdh
Out[6]: 42
</code></pre>

<p>But I cannot figure out from looking at the <a href=""https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/http/request.py"" rel=""nofollow"">source code</a> (<a href=""https://github.com/django/django/blob/9f825b9e28547b1310526c9be9fca9e6dbcd57e7/django/http/request.py#L41,L314"" rel=""nofollow"">current version</a>) how this has been achieved. The <code>HttpRequest</code> class just inherits from <code>object</code>, and doesn't seem to override <code>__setattr__</code> anwyhere:</p>

<pre><code>class HttpRequest(object):
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>So what's going on, how does it work, how come <code>request.asdf = 42</code> doesn't raise <code>AttributeError</code>? This doesn't seem to be documented anywhere either.</p>

<p>(My actual original question was whether setting such attributes (e.g. <code>request.user_has_logged_in</code> in middleware is secure and cannot be faked by malicious users, but I guess it is fine, because standard authentication middleware do similar things — right now I'm more surprised by how it works in the first place.)</p>

<p>I have the following HTML structure and I've attached the <code>dragenter</code> and <code>dragleave</code> events to the <code>&lt;div id=""dropzone""&gt;</code> element.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""dropzone""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""dropzone-content""&gt;
        &lt;div id=""drag-n-drop""&gt;
            &lt;div class=""text""&gt;this is some text&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=""text""&gt;this is a container with text and images&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>When I drag a file over the <code>&lt;div id=""dropzone""&gt;</code>, the <code>dragenter</code> event is fired as expected. However, when I move my mouse over a child element, such as <code>&lt;div id=""drag-n-drop""&gt;</code>, the <code>dragenter</code> event is fired for the <code>&lt;div id=""drag-n-drop""&gt;</code> element and then the <code>dragleave</code> event is fired for the <code>&lt;div id=""dropzone""&gt;</code> element.</p>

<p>If I hover over the <code>&lt;div id=""dropzone""&gt;</code> element again, the <code>dragenter</code> event is again fired, which is cool, but then the <code>dragleave</code> event is fired for the child element just left, so the <code>removeClass</code> instruction is executed, which is not cool.</p>

<p>This behavior is problematic for 2 reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I'm only attaching <code>dragenter</code> &amp; <code>dragleave</code> to the <code>&lt;div id=""dropzone""&gt;</code> so I don't understand why the children elements have these events attached as well.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm still dragging over the <code>&lt;div id=""dropzone""&gt;</code> element while hovering over its children so I don't want <code>dragleave</code> to fire!</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>jsFiddle</h2>

<p>Here's a jsFiddle to tinker with: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/yYF3S/2/"">http://jsfiddle.net/yYF3S/2/</a></p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>So... how can I make it such that when I'm dragging a file over the <code>&lt;div id=""dropzone""&gt;</code> element, <code>dragleave</code> doesn't fire even if I'm dragging over any children elements... it should only fire when I leave the <code>&lt;div id=""dropzone""&gt;</code> element... hovering/dragging around anywhere within the boundaries of the element <em>should not</em> trigger the <code>dragleave</code> event.</p>

<p>I need this to be cross-browser compatible, at least in the browsers that support HTML5 drag-n-drop, so <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/7115883/196921"">this answer</a> is not adequate.</p>

<p>It seems like Google and Dropbox have figured this out, but their source code is minified/complex so I haven't been able to figure this out from their implementation.</p>

I have a Status class that has a User object (the User that posted the Status). When posting the Status in JSON form, it has the user object as well. The problem is, instead of adding the Status with that User, it adds the Status AND a new User, which is obviously not what I want.</p>

<p>Here is what the JSON looks like. The User with the id 2 already exists in the database, but when this is posted, another user is created.</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""User"": {
        ""Id"": 2,
        ""First"": ""Tobin"",
        ""Last"": ""Brown"",
        ""Email"": null,
        ""Profile"": null,
        ""Height"": 75,
        ""Weight"": 165,
        ""BirthDate"": ""1991-04-24T00:00:00""
    },
    ""Id"": 2,
    ""Type"": 0,
    ""Time"": ""2015-03-08T11:01:48""
}
</code></pre>

<p>User class:</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
    [Key]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string First { get; set; }
    public string Last { get; set; }
    [DataType(DataType.EmailAddress)]
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public Profile Profile { get; set; }
    public double Height { get; set; }
    public double Weight { get; set; }
    public DateTime BirthDate { get; set; }
    public virtual List&lt;TeamUser&gt; Teams { get; set; }
    [JsonIgnore]
    public virtual List&lt;Status&gt; Statuses { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Status class:</p>

<pre><code>public class Status
{
    [Key]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public StatusType Type { get; set; }
    public DateTime Time { get; set; }
    public virtual User User { get; set; }
    public virtual Activity Activity { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally here is my controller method that handles the addition of the status to the database using the entity framework:</p>

<pre><code>[ResponseType(typeof(Status))]
public IHttpActionResult PostStatus(Status status)
{
    if (!ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        return BadRequest(ModelState);
    }
    db.Statuses.Add(Status);
    db.SaveChanges();
    return Ok(status);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Why would it be creating a new User if I am passing it the User Id in the JSON?</p>

<ul>
<li>Each user creates a ""project"".</li>
<li>In a project, the user specifies the number of items for 2 categories: cat_1 and cat_2.</li>
<li>cat_1 and cat_2 will have n1 and n2 items respectively.</li>
<li>The program then converts cat_1 and cat_2 into two matrices mat_1 mat_2 such that for each matrix rows = columns = n1 or n2. I.e. if a category has 3 records ('a', 'b', and 'c'), the matrix will be 3 by 3 with the rows and columns being 'a', 'b' and 'c'.</li>
<li>The matrix will be then multiplied by a factor (K_r).</li>
<li>The multiplication returns 48 matrices, 96 matrices, 48 for cat_1 and 48 for cat_2.</li>
<li>In each matrix there are control array/variables mat_1_aij and mat_2_bi2j2 that the user specifies and provides values for.</li>
<li>These variables represent field collected data that the simulation should match.</li>

<p>New items are being added to the page on document scroll. I am unable though to append these new items to the current masonry layout. This is why I am creating a second masonry container. On the first new set ot items, they are being generated on the top of the page and then, they move down to the bottom in a quite ugly way. After that all new Items are being added correctly, sometimes they overlap each other, sometimes not, I guess non cached images overlap. What I want to achieve is to be able to find the "".box"" html item from <code>data</code> and then append it to the existing masonry container. I have been struggling to do this for some time now after reading all related questions here, but still no success.</p>

    &lt;td&gt;

<p>This is my controller:</p>

<pre><code>def show

      respond_to do |format|
        format.html

<p>When i click the next button or the number this message appears:</p>

<p>Is it because I have the _ofertas_ativas partial? I really don't know how to fix this. I still don't understand very well this respond_to in the controller.</p>

<ol>
<li>I could not imagine how to implement the formulas using MATLAB.</li>
<li>The formulas are shaped to find <code>x'</code>,<code>y'</code> values but I already have got <code>x</code>,<code>x'</code>,<code>y</code>,<code>y'</code> values. I need to find rotation angle (theta) and <code>t</code><sub><code>x</code></sub> and <code>t</code><sub><code>y</code></sub>.</li>
<li>I want to know the equivailence of <code>x</code>, <code>x'</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>y'</code> in the the matrix.</li>

<p>I have got the following code:</p>

<pre><code>rotationMatrix = [   cos(theta) sin(theta) 0 ; ...
                    -sin(theta) cos(theta) 0 ; ...

</code></pre>

<p><em>The <code>ServerCredential</code> are null</em></p>

<pre><code>filter.ServerCredential = null
</code></pre>

<h2>Getting response from server</h2>

<pre><code>using(httpClient)
{
   using(HttpRequestMessage requestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(new HttpMethod(method), RequestUri))
   {
       using(HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.SendRequestAsync(requestMessage))
       {
           // Do something with response
       }
   }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>The issue</h2>

<p>If the <code>HttpClient</code> request returns a 200 (OK) using <code>ServerCredential</code>, then every following <code>Bearer</code> request also returns 200 (OK) even if the <code>Bearer</code> token is invalid and <code>filter.ServerCredential</code> is null. </p>

<p>It looks as if the <code>filter.ServerCredential</code> is cached and all subsequent calls are authenticated with the cached credentials.</p>

<p>I have to restart the app if I want to do a <code>Bearer</code> authentication. </p>

<p><strong>How can I remove, disable or clear the <code>ServerCredential</code> of the Windows.Web.Http.HttpClient?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Things I've tried:</p>

<h3>Deleting all cookies</h3>

<pre><code>var cookieManager = filter.CookieManager;
HttpCookieCollection myCookieJar = cookieManager.GetCookies(RequestUri);
foreach (HttpCookie cookie in myCookieJar)
{
    cookieManager.DeleteCookie(cookie);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>myCookieJar</code> is empty.</p>

<h3>Something with <code>PasswordCredentialPropertyStore</code></h3>

<pre><code>Windows.Security.Credentials.PasswordCredentialPropertyStore credentialPropertyStore = new Windows.Security.Credentials.PasswordCredentialPropertyStore();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>credentialPropertyStore</code> is empty.</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p><code>PasswordCredentialPropertyStore</code>'s method Clear <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.security.credentials.passwordcredentialpropertystore.clear"">is reserved for internal use and is not intended to be used in your code.</a></p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Is it possible to grant access to full database/or single table, but not to particular IP?</p>

<p>Lets assume I would create in MySQL some user with login and password. And then, when logging from Navicat I would have to pass these login/password to connect to db?</p>

<p>I couldn't find a Pros vs Cons about the new version 2.0 or a benchmark or something, all I have found are tutorial about doing the migration but not something to convince me on why I should migrate form 1.3 to 2.0. </p>

<p>For simple straight-through workflows, where a message comes in, is processed by a few steps, and then leaves, this could be as simple as just keeping a sequential log of the exchanges.  I can do this by writing a custom TraceEventHandler, which is called at each exchange and allows me to do logging.</p>

<p>However, if a splitter is involved, I don't know how to calculate the provenance of any given exchange.  I could maintain my own log of exchanges, but in the case of a splitter, not all previous activity would be an ancestor of the current exchange.  That is, if an incoming message is split into part1 and part2, which are then each processed separately, I don't want to consider the processing of part1 when calculating the history of part2.</p>

<p>A TraceEventHandler has this method:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void traceExchange(ProcessorDefinition&lt;?&gt; node, Processor target, 
  TraceInterceptor traceInterceptor,Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
}
</code></pre>

<p>and I expected that there would be an Exchange method like <code>Exchange getPreviousExchange()</code> that I could call inside traceExchange, but I can find no such thing.</p>

<p>Any advice?  I'm not married to using a custom TraceEventHandler if there's a better way to do this.</p>

class ConcreteValueB implements Value {
    @Override
    public Integer getValue() {
        return 3;
    }
 }

<p>and a service implementation with overloaded methods like below which perform operations based on input type.</p>

<pre><code>public class ImplA implements Interface{

    private final Function&lt;ConcreteValueA, Optional&lt;String&gt;&gt; handleConcreteA = this::handle;

I have selected the text book <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0763772062"">Discrete Structures, Logic, and Computability</a> in part because it contains examples and concepts that are conducive to implementation with a functional programming language. (I also think it's a good textbook.)</p>

<p>I want an easy-to-understand FP language to illustrate DS concepts and that the students can use. Most students will have had only one or two semesters of programming in Java, at best. After looking at Scheme, Erlang, Haskell, Ocaml, and SML, I've settled on either Haskell or Standard ML. I'm leaning towards Haskell for the reasons outlined below, but I'd like the opinion of those who are active programmers in one or the other.</p>

<ul>
<li>Both Haskell and SML have pattern matching which makes describing a recursive algorithm a cinch.</li>
<li>Haskell has nice list comprehensions that match nicely with the way such lists are expressed mathematically.</li>
<li>Haskell has lazy evaluation. Great for constructing infinite lists using the list comprehension technique.</li>
<li>SML has a truly interactive interpreter in which functions can be both defined and used. In Haskell, functions must be defined in a separate file and compiled before being used in the interactive shell.</li>
<li>SML gives explicit confirmation of the function argument and return types in a syntax that's easy to understand. For example: val foo = fn : int * int -> int. Haskell's implicit curry syntax is a bit more obtuse, but not totally alien. For example: foo :: Int -> Int -> Int.</li>
<li>Haskell uses arbitrary-precision integers by default. It's an external library in SML/NJ. And SML/NJ truncates output to 70 characters by default.</li>
<li>Haskell's lambda syntax is subtle -- it uses a single backslash. SML is more explicit. Not sure if we'll ever need lambda in this class, though.</li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially, SML and Haskell are roughly equivalent. I lean toward Haskell because I'm loving the list comprehensions and infinite lists in Haskell. But I'm worried that the extensive number of symbols in Haskell's compact syntax might cause students problems. From what I've gathered reading other posts on SO, Haskell is not recommended for beginners starting out with FP. But we're not going to be building full-fledged applications, just trying out simple algorithms.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Edit: Upon reading some of your great responses, I should clarify some of my bullet points.</p>

<p>In SML, there's no syntactic distinction between defining a function in the interpreter and defining it in an external file. Let's say you want to write the factorial function. In Haskell you can put this definition into a file and load it into GHCi:</p>

<pre><code>fac 0 = 1
fac n = n * fac (n-1)
</code></pre>

<p>To me, that's clear, succinct, and matches the mathematical definition in the book. But if you want to write the function in GHCi directly, you have to use a different syntax:</p>

<pre><code>let fac 0 = 1; fac n = n * fac (n-1)
</code></pre>

<p>When working with interactive interpreters, from a teaching perspective it's very, very handy when the student can use the same code in both a file and the command line.</p>

<p>By ""explicit confirmation of the function,"" I meant that upon defining the function, SML right away tells you the name of the function, the types of the arguments, and the return type. In Haskell you have to use the :type command and then you get the somewhat confusing curry notation.</p>

<p>One more cool thing about Haskell--this is a valid function definition:</p>

<pre><code>fac 0 = 1
fac (n+1) = (n+1) * fac n
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this matches a definition they might find in the textbook. Can't do that in SML!</p>

<p><strong>Part 2</strong><br>
Here's what I'm trying to do - the sp returns requested financial data from a web form.   A user chooses the following options from a form:</p>

<pre><code>""financial item"", ""financial year"", ""minimum value"", ""maximum value"", ""and/or""  
Revenue, 2010, 1000000, 10000000, 'and'  
EPS, 2011, 0.5, 1.5, 'or'  
</code></pre>

<p>There could be 1 row or 50 rows depending on the users request.  I want to load those items into a UDTT. In the stored procedure I create a dynamic query. A cursor iterates over the rows of the UDTT and creates the conditions in the where clause of the dynamic query. The data is then returned.  </p>

<p>The problem I'm having is I don't seem to be able to get PHP to return any results when I use the UDTT. I just used the simplified example above to see if anyone could get data returned.</p>

<p>I should add that when I print the ""real"" string I'm passing from PHP to SQL the stored procedure does return data. And that my connection to SQL is good.</p>

<p><strong>Third and final part</strong>
I should have prefaced the original question by saying I'm a complete novice when it comes to PHP. Not bad at SQL though.</p>

<p>OK here's what I've tried:</p>

<p>SQL with no UDTT</p>

<pre><code>drop procedure testUDTT

go

create PROCEDURE [testUDTT]
as
SET NOCOUNT ON
select XmlRequest = '###Data Returned###'

go
</code></pre>

<p>if I run the following PHP code data is returned:</p>

<pre><code>$select=""exec testUDTT"";
$sqlResponse=sqlsrv_query($conn, $select);
while( $row = sqlsrv_fetch_array( $sqlResponse, SQLSRV_FETCH_ASSOC) ) {
  print '####'.$row['XmlRequest'];
  }
</code></pre>

<p>If I change $select to:</p>

<pre><code>$select=""declare @ScreensParam [ScreensTableType] exec testUDTT"";
</code></pre>

<p>data is returned.</p>

<p>However if I change $select to:</p>

<pre><code>$select=""declare @ScreensParam [ScreensTableType] insert @ScreensParam values (5101.00,2011,0,100,1),(5103.00,2011,0,100,1) exec testUDTT"";
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NO</strong> data is returned and there are no errors???. I suspect SQL wants a ""GO"" between the ""insert"" and ""exec"" statements although this works fine when I run from SSMS.</p>

<p>I was thinking about this another way as well. If the above stored procedure had one input param like an int eg:</p>

<pre><code>create PROCEDURE [testUDTT]
@InputInt int
as
SET NOCOUNT ON
if @InputInt &gt; 0
  select XmlRequest = '###Data Returned###'
</code></pre>

<p>my PHP code could look something like:</p>

<pre><code>$inputInt=1;
$select=""exec testUDTT @InputInt=?"";
$params = array(
  array($inputInt, SQLSRV_PARAM_IN)
  );
$sqlResponse=sqlsrv_query($conn, $select, $params);
</code></pre>

<p>Now If I had this stored procedure using a UDTT:</p>

<pre><code>create PROCEDURE [testUDTT]
@ScreensParam ScreensTableType READONLY
as
SET NOCOUNT ON
select XmlRequest = '###Data Returned###'
from @ScreensParam

go
</code></pre>

<p>and I try to break the PHP call to sql into 2 parts (not sure if this is correct, but gave it a try):</p>

<pre><code>$add='declare @ScreensParam [ScreensTableType] insert @ScreensParam values (5101.00,2011,0,100,1),(5103.00,2011,0,100,1)';
$select='exec testUDTT @ScreensParam='.$screensParam;

sqlsrv_query($conn, $add);
$sqlResponse=sqlsrv_query($conn, $select);
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following error: <code>SQLSTATE: 42000 code: 137 message: [Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 11.0][SQL Server]Must declare the scalar variable ""@ScreensParam"".</code> as I guess the UDTT is not in scope.
Also I wonder what the PHP syntax should be for passing @ScreensParam in the array? Would $select become <code>exec testUDTT @ScreensParam=?</code> where <code>""?"" = '@ScreensParam'</code>. Don't know?</p>

<p>So I've found a solution creating XML instead of using UDTT which is acceptable. And I've spent more than enough time trying to get it to work. I have a sneaking suspicion that what I want to do can't be done with PHP currently.</p>

<p>If anyone has/finds a solution though, I'd love to know.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>and I try to break the PHP call to sql into 2 parts (not sure if this is correct, but gave it a try):</p>

<pre><code>$add='declare @ScreensParam [ScreensTableType] insert @ScreensParam values (5101.00,2011,0,100,1),(5103.00,2011,0,100,1)';
$select='exec testUDTT @ScreensParam='.$screensParam;

sqlsrv_query($conn, $add);
$sqlResponse=sqlsrv_query($conn, $select);
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following error: <code>SQLSTATE: 42000 code: 137 message: [Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 11.0][SQL Server]Must declare the scalar variable ""@ScreensParam"".</code> as I guess the UDTT is not in scope.
Also I wonder what the PHP syntax should be for passing @ScreensParam in the array? Would $select become <code>exec testUDTT @ScreensParam=?</code> where <code>""?"" = '@ScreensParam'</code>. Don't know?</p>

<p>So I've found a solution creating XML instead of using UDTT which is acceptable. And I've spent more than enough time trying to get it to work. I have a sneaking suspicion that what I want to do can't be done with PHP currently.</p>

<p>If anyone has/finds a solution though, I'd love to know.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help Fuzzy Button. It was fun trying.</p>

<p>To illustrate the problem I am adding a series of data to the chart each time the button is pressed, and the current data is on the left hand side. I want to use the same color for each column, and just to demarcate the spaces in the bar using a line. But, the column stacks appear to be very slightly misaligned and I'm not sure why.</p>

"10553112","1","10553207","","2012-05-11 14:15:44","","0","513","<p>I am trying to come up with a solid SVN repository structure and branching strategy for a small team of four.  We have four major and several minor projects in development at any one time, and there is often some overlap between projects.  Our current strategy is totally inefficient and consists of having each of these folders (approximately 15 or so) under a single versioned ""trunk"" folder.  This means whenever we branch, we branch all 15 projects (it takes around 20 minutes to update the working copy and pull down a branch, to put this into perspective).</p>

<p>The main concern is that some projects overlap, and it's not uncommon for a feature or task to require changing something in Project A as well as in Project B (all of these projects talk to the same database and use the same database tables; in addition they share a business layer so that changing a class in one project will affect the other), as the projects are all essentially related parts of one ""umbrella"" application.  As an example, for the major projects there is basically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project A: Front-end e-commerce site</li>
<li>Project B: Back-end fulfillment/management system</li>
<li>Project C: An unbranded copy of the front-end site (same thing minus CSS styles and with less functionality)</li>
<li>Project D: Web Service API</li>
</ul>

<p>A and B are intertwined, but B is a software-as-a-service application (we act as our own client) with C as it's front end for customers (A serves as the front end for our own company, since C is essentially A with less features and without company-specific details).  D is only accessed by clients, but it's my ultimate goal to have A, B and C all use the functionality of D via web services (eating our own dogfood, basically).</p>

<p>We have just decided to go with a three-week deployment strategy (meaning we do a production deployment every three weeks) and our current SVN strategy is cumbersome and makes branching extremely painful.</p>

<p>With several projects having an overlap, would it make sense to keep them all under one project folder with the branches/tags/trunks format, or should we treat them as individual projects?  Maybe combine some, for instance having the SaaS frontend/backend together, with our own site and the web service being separate?  </p>

<p>Any suggestions or advice from people involved in similar projects would be great.</p>

<p>If I have a server side view model that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class InventoryIndexViewModel
{
    public bool IsDeleteReceiverButtonVisible { get; set; }
    public IList&lt;Receiver&gt; Receivers { get; set; }

    public string ReceiversAsJson

            return receivers;
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>And the Receiver property is an object that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Receiver
{
    public Cooperative Cooperative { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the Cooperative property is an object that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Cooperative
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My view looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>@model InventoryIndexViewModel

@{
    Layout = ""~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml"";
    ViewBag.Title = ""Inventory List"";
}

@section scripts{
    &lt;script&gt;
        $(function() {
            var inventoryViewModel = function() {

                var self = this;

                self.isDeleteButtonVisible = function() { return @Model.IsDeleteReceiverButtonVisible.ToString().ToLower(); }();
                self.receivers = ko.observableArray(@Html.Raw(Model.ReceiversAsJson));
            };

            ko.applyBindings(new inventoryViewModel());
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;
}

&lt;div class=""col-md-10""&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;table class=""table table-striped""&gt;
        &lt;tbody data-bind=""foreach: receivers""&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td data-bind=""text: serialNumber""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td data-bind=""text: cooperative.Name""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So the question is, how to work with the complex Receiver object.  In my view code, I've tried to data-bind to cooperative.Name, but that does not work.  I am guessing that I need to use the Knockout mapping plugin, but I've tried the syntax at the Knockout page along with several different syntax variations I've found by Googling, but nothing I have tried seems to work.</p>

<p>On a side note, the code shown here is vastly simplified from my real code.  So, while there probably is a very easy way in this simplified code to get to the cooperative.Name through data-binding, just consider that the Receiver object is a complex object with many properties that are themselves, complex objects, so that is where the Knockout mapping engine would do the grunt work of turning everything into observables throughout the entire object hierarchy.</p>

<p>Or maybe it can't and I am way off base.  Thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Updated server side view model to correctly include the ReceiversAsJson method that I forgot to include originally.</p>

<li><p>files dir, which is a persistence folder which <strong>doesn't</strong> get deleted when storage space is low:</p>

Will files saved to the cache dir act like the MODE_PRIVATE in the files dir?
meaning - will they be accessible only to my app, or will other apps also be able to access the files?</p>

<p>The thing i'm tripping up on is figuring out how to get the updated values back into my custom object and update the values in array at the correct index.</p>

<p>For example:
I'll add an item and set it's quantity to 2. This will appear in my ListView. Great. I decide i need 3 instead of 2, so i click the item to open the new activity, see 2 sitting in quantity, update it to 3 and hit save. On the save click i want to go back to my listview and have the updated quantity value displaying there and also updated in the array at the index.</p>

<p>Code for segments:</p>

                                int arg2, long arg3) {

            bean = (CustomObject) listview.getItemAtPosition(arg2);

            Intent in1 = new Intent(Itemlist.this, SingleItem.class);

<p>However this doesn't work because DBIx::Class treats <code>DAYOFYEAR(entry_time)</code> as a column. Is there anyway I could have it use that value litteraly? I know sometimes making it a scalar such as <code>\'DAYOFYEAR(entry_time)'</code> will work for some situations, but I've tried that and it doesn't work. Does anyone know of a way that I could do this? Thanks!</p>

<p>As I have mainly been testing on the emulators and only every now and again exporting to a real phone I am not sure when this happened. What is the likely cause of it not installing on a physical phone but running fine in the emulators?</p>

I want to see the most subtle differences - inches - between the outputted coordinates on two calls of my method. However, the geolocator seems to remember its last measurement when I hit the ""Read Again"" button, then just spit out the same coordinates. To confirm this I tried two tests:</p>

<p>In test A, I kept spamming measure again as I was walking. The same measurement was outputted.</p>

<p>In test B, I turned off location services and turned it back on. Then, I made a measurement. I changed my position. Then, I turned it off and back on again and made another measurement. The location changed.</p>

<p>This is my current code for the geolocator.  (It is async and called each time a button is tapped) My goal is to make it forget the last measurement, similar to what happens when I turn location services off.</p>

<pre><code>        async void Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {

            Geolocator geolocator = new Geolocator();

            else
            {

                Geoposition geoposition = await locationTask;
                distances.Children.Add(new TextBlock(){Text = geoposition.Coordinate.Latitude.ToString() + "","" + geoposition.Coordinate.Longitude.ToString()} );
                updnum = updnum + 1;
                //Numupd.Text = updnum.ToString();

<p>I use <a href=""https://www.rstudio.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">R-studio</a> for debugging purpose, and I see that <strong><a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pracma/"" rel=""nofollow"">integral</a></strong> function pass a vector to the <strong>f</strong> function.</p>

<p>I understand that <strong>v2</strong> is a vector and <strong>x</strong> is a vector. But I'm currently don't know how to make this work without warnings. I have tried to put <strong><a href=""http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Vectorize.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Vectorize(x)</a></strong> in the <strong><a href=""http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/sum.html"" rel=""nofollow"">sum</a></strong> function, but warnings are still here.</p>

<p>How to properly handle this situation?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usually <code>MapperFactoryBean</code> is preferred to this class, since it
  requires no extra code. But, this class(<code>DAO</code>) is useful if you need to do
  other non-MyBatis work in your <code>DAO</code> and concrete classes are required and use <code>SqlSessionDaoSupport</code> or <code>SqlSessionFactory</code> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In case I chose to use <code>MapperFactoryBean</code> today in my project, but later I would need to use <code>concrete DAO</code> (may be because you may not do 100% using SQLs in mapper), then I need to change the design.</p>

<p>If the above is true, then MapperFactoryBean would be very less useful and would never(or mostly) be a choice. </p>

<p>In other words: Can MapperFactoryBean and DAO co-exists? Even if yes, should they be?</p>

"9177755","1","","","2012-02-07 14:12:21","","1","193","<p>I'm working on a software whose main job is doing lots of arithmetic. 
The user provides a set of inputs, the program does the maths and produces a set of outputs. It's important though that the user gets a report/log of the calculations done to reach the produced results. As a simple example, let's say the user wants to calculate the weight of some particle, a calculation report would look something like the following :</p>

<h1>Inputs:</h1>

<p>Mass = 50 Kg</p>

<p>G = 10 m/s^2</p>

<h1>Step 1:</h1>

<p>Weight = Mass \times G = 500 N</p>

<h1>Outputs:</h1>

<p>Weight = 500 N</p>

<p>(I have used latex syntax because the equations need to be rendered properly later). Imagine lots of ""maths problems"" like this one, but each incurring 70+ equations with a set of 10+ inputs and a comparable number of outputs. And not all equations are going to be invoked. Each run will invoke a set of equations depending on the provided set of inputs, and there could be backtracking in the middle of the run, so if an equation is logged and then a backtracking decision takes place, a different calculation path maybe taken, and thus the said equation should be removed from the log.</p>

<p>My main problem is how to design a sheet-building module/sub-system with minimal duplication. If there's an open-source program that does something similar so I can take some ideas that would be perfect.</p>

<p>Currently, I treat each equation as an object, each has a function performing the intended calculation and a string holding its latex representation.</p>

<p>Variables are a different story though, off the top of my head, I'm thinking of just logging the variables of each step in a dictionary or some similar data structure. But then there are the problems of duplication and hardcoding a variable's textual representation.</p>

<p>I know the scope of the question seems to be too wide, but I'm trying to explain the problem as much as I can. But I think I can summarize this in :</p>

<p>Is there a clean generic abstraction of such problem that I am failing to see ?</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I am thinking of logging the computations in a structured format (XML for example). 
Continuing on the weight example above, the code will output the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;problem name=""Weight Calculation"" &gt;
       &lt;inputs&gt;
              &lt;var name=""Mass"" &gt;50&lt;/var&gt;
              &lt;var name=""G"" &gt;10&lt;/var&gt;
       &lt;/inputs&gt;
       &lt;step name=""Get Weight"" &gt;
              &lt;eqn id=""1"" &gt;
                     &lt;var name=""Weight"" &gt;500&lt;/var&gt;
              &lt;/eqn&gt;
       &lt;/step&gt;
&lt;/problem&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note: The latex string for equation 1 will be in an external file, so that - <em>if needed</em> - it could be found using the equation's ID, which is unique all over the program.</strong></p>

<p>The code to do this will probably look something like the following :</p>

<pre><code>eqn_1(weight, mass, g)
{
    LOG_BEGINEQN(""1"");

    weight = mass * g;

    LOG_RES(""Weight"", weight);
    LOG_ENDEQN();

}

GetWeight_Step(Weight, Mass, G)
{
    LOG_BEGINSTEP(""Get Weight"");

    eqn_1(Weight, Mass, G);

    LOG_ENDSTEP();
}

Weight_Problem(Mass, G)
{
   LOG_BEGINPROB(""Weight Calculation"");

   LOG_BEGININPUTS();
   LOG_VAR(""Mass"", Mass);
   LOG_VAR(""G"", Mass);
   LOG_ENDINPUTS();

   var Weight;
   GetWeigh_Step(Weight, Mass, G);

   LOG_ENDPROB();

}

main()
{
    Weight_Problem(50, 10);
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>This code of course is very loosely typed. It's just there to serve as an aid in explaining the problem.</em></p>

<p>Advantages:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Separated the output data (or model) of the calculation log from its presentation. Anything could now read the XML file and manipulate how the data should be presented to the user.</p></li>
<li><p>Equation objects no longer need to hold their latex representation. An equation just needs a unique ID, which is already something we do. "" <em>Code is code, Data is data, and life is good.</em> ""</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It looks to me that this method is highly error prone. I can use a script that would be hooked to the build to check the balance _BEGIN's and <em>END's ... I could also take this further and write a script that would actually insert the LOG</em> functions in their proper places before the code is compiled, but this would not be possible without enforcing some coding conventions, like how inputs, equations and steps should be named ... etc. Again, this depends very much on the coder, and thus is still highly error prone.</p></li>
<li><p>No separation of concerns/responsibilities. Code that does the computation also handles logging. Although I think this will always be the case with logging, and so this may not be a real disadvantage.</p></li>

<code>&lt;input name=""ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$gvTime$ctl03$txtbTimeStartTime"" type=""text"" id=""ContentPlaceHolder1_gvTime_txtbTimeStartTime"" class=""textbox""&gt;</code></p>

<p>This is making it hard to attach my date time pickers as I can no longer select just the correct ones by class.</p>

In that episode, they talked about the possibilities to extend your application to expose functionality for PowerShell.</p>

<p>Now this sounds interesting.
Have any of you done such extensions that exposes functionality in your application?
If so, what kind of functionallity?</p>

<p>EDIT:
To be more precise: I am not interested in hosting PowerShell in my application. I'm more interested in opening up my application with an API-like interface. So a PowerShell Provider seems to be the technology I'm looking for more insight in.</p>

<li>Event is triggered and the listening application loads.</li>

<p>The application could also listen for a <em>save to camera roll event</em>, as this will allow for the same types of modification.</p>

In case someone intentionally disable the JavaScript on their browser and try to upload huge files to the server, what back-end options do I have to intercept this ? Is reading the multi-part header file size a reliable approach ? Or should I use limited buffer file/input reader that drop the stream if it exceeds certain number of bytes ?

<p>I'm having trouble with this question.</p>

<p>write a function<code>doubles()</code> that takes as input a list of integers and outputs the integers in the list that are exactly twice that previous integer in the list, one per line.</p>

<p>So what I've been trying to do at first was to write a code that goes through the list of integers by using index</p>

<p>Such as:</p>

<pre><code>integers = []

def doubles(integers):
    index = 0
    while index &lt; len(integers):
        if index == (2*(index+1)):           
            print(index)

doubles([3,0,1,2,3,6,2,4,5,6,5])
</code></pre>

<p>What I think of the code I've written is that. While the index is less than the length of the list of integers, if the index is equal to double the next index it will print out that number. However I've seem to not get the result I want. Thank you.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
$_anyActive = false; 

foreach ($this-&gt;getStoreCategories() as $_category) 
{ 
   $_anyActive = $_anyActive || $this-&gt;isCategoryActive($_category);

<p>This code now makes the home link shows but now its only shows in the default store but i want it to show in all other stores, i dont understand this but as they whole stores shares the same theme, i thought maybe they should also be able to read this code and display the home link, i could duplicate the themes and then assign them to each store (which i'm not even sure would work) but that would make the code deficult to maintain as i though if they share the same design, i could just make one change and reflect on the entire sub stores. </p>

<p>The following is the content of template/page/navigation/top.php</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?php $_menu = ''?&gt;

<p>I managed to get jstree's <em>rename</em> context menu item to ""work"", meaning: I bound an ajax call to the jstree rename event, so when the user renames a node, it tells a WCF method to update the database (to ""save"" the new name).</p>

<p><strong>Problem: If I go to another page and then come back later, the node has reverted to the old name!</strong></p>

<p>It looks like there is some kind of caching going on, either in jstree or the browser, or WCF, and the tree isn't being refreshed somehow.</p>

<p>The data is coming from a database via a WCF service method over JSON. When you first visit the page, the data is loaded. But when you come <em>back</em> to the page, it isn't: the breakpoint in the server-side load method is never hit. It seems likely to me that either:</p>

<ul>
<li>jstree has cached the data and doesn't try to load it again (but why doesn't it stay renamed?) </li>
</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<ul>
<li>jstree asks the service, but WCF just gives the same data again from a cache rather than actually running the service method. </li>
</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<ul>
<li>The browser is caching the request and giving the same result back to jstree without calling the WCF method.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any ideas? How can I check this?</p>

<p>I am currently working on a web-app that stores information and meta-data for a large amount of applications. For each application there could be anywhere from 10 to 100's of comments that are tied to the application and an application version id. I am using MongoDB because of a need for easy future scalability and speed. I have read that comments should be embedded in a collection for read performance reasons, but I'm not sure that this works in my case. I read on another post:</p>

<blockquote>
In general, if you need to work with a given data set on its own, make it a collection.
<br />By: @kb
</blockquote>

<p>In my case however I don't need to work on the collection by themselves. Let me explain further. I will have a table of apps (that can be filtered) and will dynamically load entries as you scroll, or filter, through the list of apps. If I embed the comments within the application collection, I am sending ALL the comments when I dynamically load the application entry into the table. However, I would like to do ""lazy loading"" in that I only want to load the comments when the user requests to see them (by clicking on the entry in the table).</p>

<p>As an example, my table might look like the following</p>

<pre><code>| app name | version | rating | etc. | view comments |
------------------------------------------------------
| app1     | v.1.0   | 4 star | etc. | click me!     |
| app2     | v.2.4.5 | 3 star | etc. | click me!     |
| ...
</code></pre>

<p>My question is what would be more efficient? Are reads fast enough on MongoDB that it really doesn't matter that I am pulling all the comments with each application? If a user did not filter any of the applications and scrolled all the way to the bottom, they might load somewhere between 125k to 250k entries/applications.</p>

I didn't write most of the code, so I'm not exactly sure how everything works.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, MGRS/USNG zones are basically renamed UTM zones, which in turn are defined in terms of lat/long.</p>

<p>Let's say I have an MGRS coordinate and I move a certain displacement. Can I accurately determine whether I crossed a zone boundary without first converting to lat/long? I know how to update coordinates as I move within a zone because most everything is square within zones.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to detect zone changes without having to convert to lat/long?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Are there any libraries, in any language, that do this?</strong></p>

<p>The existing code requires a latitude and longitude, so I guess I could convert to lat/long, apply the transformation, and then convert back to MGRS. This wouldn't be that bad if I only want to determine the zone I'm in, then I can keep the rest of the transformation stuff in MGRS to maintain precision. The only issue is, I want to be as precise as possible.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>For obvious reasons this is not optimal. How would I use map strings to methods like this in a reusable way (also note that I need to pass in arguments to the called functions).</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<p>INCOMING JSON:</p>

<pre><code>{
    'method': 'say_something',
    'args': [
        135487,
        'a_465cc1'
    ]
    'kwargs': {
        'message': 'Hello World',
        'volume': 'Loud'
    }
}

# JSON would be turned into Python with Python's built in json module.
</code></pre>

<p>Resulting call:</p>

<pre><code># Either this
say_something(135487, 'a_465cc1', message='Hello World', volume='Loud')

# Or this (this is more preferable of course)
say_something(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to delete a speific element in an array of class objects. i am overwriting the element i want to delete with the element after it. My algorithm works but the output is not correct, after debugging and going through the code step by step it seems my objects just dont copy, is there a way to copy a class object, i have looked up copy constructors and attempted to write one but it does not seem to have any effect on the output. I would appreciate any help. thanks</p>

<p>As you can see, at the bottom of the page, the most 5 recents comments is opened and below them a button to load more comments. This button is what I intended to auto-click and I believe it's a css button. </p>

<p>As my attempt to click failed I tryied an alternate solution without success.
The hidden comments are marked with the: </p>

<pre><code>class=""off""
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/99Tq9.png"" alt=""class=off""></p>

<p>When I remove this class on firebug, the comment instantly appears on the page, but I couldn't get it selected or founded with jQuery, when I tryied the following:</p>

<pre><code>$(""li"").removeClass(""off"");

Here is my fail code, which appears to never found the elements waited:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python2.5
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works fine except that the application name in the OSX menubar is still ""Python"" although I have set the CFBundleName in Info.plist (I copied the result of py2app, actually). <a href=""https://github.com/gyim/stupidgit/blob/435a6a8d55a7c95ca174a3b769a27b2ef842f74d/setup/osx/Info.plist"" rel=""nofollow"">The full Info.plist can be viewed here</a>.</p>

<p>How can I change this? I have read everywhere that the menubar name is only determined by CFBundleName. How is it possible that the Python interpreter can change this in runtime?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I was using py2app before, but the result was too large (>50 MB instead of the current 100KB) and it was not even portable between Leopard and Snow Leopard... so it  seems to be much easier to create a pure-Python app bundle ""by hand"" than transforming the output of py2app.</p>

According to the book I'm working off by Cormen we are to use the first element in an array as the pivot. I'm just stuck on what to do since the first element happens to be 1. <br> 
The array looks as follows: <br>
[1, 16, 2, 3, 14, 5, 12, 7, 10, 8, 9, 17, 19, 21, 23, 26, 27] <br> 
Again, the problem with the algorithm in the book is that it chooses the first element as the pivot. And once we have compared 1 to all the other elements and find that there is no other element smaller than or equal to then we are to swap the pivot and the middle element of the sub arrays, where subarray on the left is smaller than the pivot and the subarray on the right is greater than the pivot. But if our pivot IS 1 then there is no way we can swap. Really confused, any help would be great. The title of the book is Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition in case someone out there is familiar with it. </p>

<p><strong>The code to solve it was as follows:</strong></p>

<pre><code>/*Function to left rotate arr[] of siz n by d*/
void leftRotate(int arr[], int d, int n)
{
  int i, j, k, temp;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; gcd(d, n); i++)
  {
    /* move i-th values of blocks */
    temp = arr[i];
    j = i;
    while(1)
    {
      k = j + d;
      if (k &gt;= n)
        k = k - n;
      if (k == i)
        break;
      arr[j] = arr[k];
      j = k;
    }
    arr[j] = temp;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have two questions regarding this algorithm - </p>

<ol>
<li>How does the GCD decide the number of cycles needed to rotate the
array?</li>
<li>Why is it that once we finish a cycle, we start the new
cycle from the next element ie. can't the next element be already a
part of a processed cycle?</li>
</ol>

<p>I feel, I am missing something fundamental regarding the working of <strong>GCD</strong>, <strong>modulus</strong> and the <strong>cycles</strong>. </p>

<p>The following question had an answer to my first question, but still I was not able to understand it.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21910835/juggling-algorithm-of-string-rotation"">Juggling algorithm of string rotation</a></p>

<p>So, it would be helpful if someone can explain it in layman terms and the principle behind how they all gel together to make this algorithm work.</p>

We have an upload control, which we use with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>if(fileUpload.HasFile)
{
   retArr = fileUpload.FileBytes;
   return retArr;

</code></pre>

<p>We then take the <code>byte[]</code> and save this in to a DB. This works for binary types and also looks fine for SVG files.</p>

<p>For displaying the files we use a generic handler <code>ashx</code>. We use the following code specificly for SVG files (i.e. when we can't decode the file in to an <code>Image</code> object via a <code>MemoryStream</code>):</p>

<pre><code>var svg = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(image.StandardConImage);
context.Response.ContentType = ""image/svg+xml"";
context.Response.Write(svg);
</code></pre>

<p>This code gives me a Hex encoded string, while I was expecting XML. I searched around, but could not find anything on what the browser / IIS / ASP.NET does to the SVG file to make it a <code>byte[]</code> for the upload control, so that I can undo this on the way back.</p>

<p>I have tried to resolve the situation using the API Explorer.  It has been very helpful.  When I try to authenticate using the YouTube Manager Owner profile account.  The query fails.  But if I use the Google+ page account, which is different, I can get the query to work.  The Google+ page account has an email account but all correspondence with the Google+ page account is directed to the manager owner profile account.  So I tried to add the Google+ page account to the project permissions, but there is no way of confirming the link. I think my problem is that the YouTube Channel is owned by the Google+ page account.  The manager owner assigned has a different account, a profile account, even though it is the manager of the youtube account.  I know this sounds really confusing.  Does anyone have any ideas on how to solve the problem.  Thanks</p>

<p>What is the best practice around orders, customers and products. Should my client be able to delete orders, customers and products?</p>

<p>Currently I have designed my database around the principle of relationships between order, customer and product like this:</p>

<br>...</p>

<p><strong>Product</strong>
<br>ID
<br>Name

<p><strong>Order Line</strong>
<br>ID
<br>OrderID
<br>ProductID</p>

<p>Like this I can connect all the different tables. But what if my client delete a product, what happens when he later open a order he created months ago which had that item in it. It would be gone, since it has been deleted. Same goes for customer.</p>

<p>Should I just disable the products and customers when the delete button is clicked or what is the best practice?</p>

<p>If I lets say diable a product whenever my client decides to delete it, what happens then if he later tries to add a new product with the same product ID as a disabled product, should I just enable that item again?</p>

<p>The idea stems from implementing a 'Dispose' pattern across all view models. One area in particular I think is a major headache as far as memory leaks are concerned are events, and therefore I believe this solution should address this nicely.</p>

<p>The way I think about it is that this should allow 1 and only one subscriber to subscribe to events at a time. Meaning that the same object shouldn't be able to subscribe for the same event twice and having the subsequent side effects.</p>

<p>Second, since I keep a reference to the subscribers of the event - when dispose comes around I can get rid of those references, regardless of the fact that the EventHandler internally keeps the same references. I get a chance to unhook the event completely by unhooking all of it's subscribers and thus preventing the pesky memory leaks.</p>

<p>Does anyone think this will introduce issues in the app? I mean it's rather large and I don't want to push experimental stuff without researching a bit more.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Start with the <code>DisposableObject</code> base class:</p>

<pre><code>public class DisposableObject : IDisposable
{
  private bool disposed = false; // to detect redundant calls

  /// &lt;summary&gt;
  /// Default constructor
  /// &lt;/summary&gt;
  public DisposableObject() { }

  /// &lt;summary&gt;
  /// Object that inherit from this base class should override this method instead,
  /// since it's called from the Dispose() method by the base.
  /// &lt;/summary&gt;
  /// &lt;param name=""disposing""&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
  protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
  {
    if (!disposed)
    {
      if (disposing)
      {
        // dispose-only, i.e. non-finalizable logic
      }

      // shared cleanup logic
      disposed = true;
    }
  }

  /// &lt;summary&gt;
  /// Destructor
  /// &lt;/summary&gt;
  ~DisposableObject()
  {
    Dispose(false);
  }

  /// &lt;summary&gt;
  /// Implementation of IDisposable. Object that inherit from this base class
  /// should override the Dispose(bool) method instead.
  /// &lt;/summary&gt;
  public void Dispose()
  {
    Dispose(true);
    GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then the actual implementation: <code>DelegateCommand</code> (or rather it's base class).</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class DelegateCommandBase : DisposableObject, ICommand
{
  private bool _isDisposed = false;
  private event EventHandler _canExecuteChanged;

<p>So I've got a solution with a C# project and the C++ data interface project.  The C++ interface project is compiling with /clr, /MDd, and /EHa, but it depends on a lot of libs that are compiled with /EHsc and MTd.  The linker doesn't like it when those flags don't match.  </p>

<p>If I change the data interface to use /MTd and /EHsc like its dependencies, it tells me that is inconsistent with /clr.  I assume I have to get the C++ data interface to compile with /clr so it can talk to the C# visualization, right?  But I don't own the C++ project's dependency libraries, so I can't change how they are compiled.  </p>

<p>So my question is, can you get a C# application to talk to a C++ DLL when that DLL has dependencies that were compiled with the /MTd and EHsc options?  </p>

<p>Lib Project - only has 2 libs on build path: Android 2.1 and com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.LIBRARIES</p>

<p>First stub project that uses above lib - has the same 2 libs as above project, plus sometimes I use ""Add JAR"" to include the JAR from the above project's bin\ folder.</p>

<p>2nd stub project - same libs as first stub project</p>

<p>Should I reference the JAR from my ""lib project"" using one of the other tabs under build path options?  Maybe the ""Project"" tab instead, or the ""Source"" tab?  I don't currently have it under any of those other areas.</p>

<p>When I get in to the weird state, doing a ""Clean project"" also doesn't help, I've tried that several times and open/close the IDE between cleaning, to no resolve.</p>

<p>At this point we are in the final testing stages, so my normal daily task is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make a minor update (bug fix) in the LIB project</p></li>
<li><p>Use the publish wizard to export both projects and update Android Market and other places we keep the APK files</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So I'd like those steps to stay simple, without having to open/close multiple workspaces or go through a lot of build steps if possible.</p>

<p>but I'd rather have some more type-safety by requiring a more specialized type and not detect that <code>""""</code> is no valid filename within the method.</p>

<p>The class <code>File</code> doesn't work because it's static. </p>

<p>The class <code>FileInfo</code> could be used but I cannot remember that I've come across a filename argument of this type.</p>

<p>In personal projects I made up my own class that simply does some checking if the filename is well-formed etc. so e.g. an exception is thrown upon creation of the filename and not in the method itself.</p>

<p>Since the new project is of wider scope I'd thought it would be better to use a common standard to not confuse other users (or my future self in some weeks).</p>

<p>Some of my services call other services, my question is how can i pass the same UnitOfWork between service layers?</p>

<p>In my case all controller actions are initiated from a GUI on each button action or event on a timer, this is why I have a factory to create UnitOfWork on demand, but it is causing issues as i dont know how to pass this UnitOfWork between services.</p>

<p>Especially difficult is knowing how to get this specific UnitOfWork instance injected into the service constructor. Please note that some of the services may be long running (10 minutes or so on a background thread), i don't know if that has any impact on the design or not.</p>

<p>Currently the service that is called from the other service is then creating its own UnitOfWork which is causing issues for both transactional design, and Entity framework entity tracking.</p>

<p>When compiled and linked (with gcc 4.2.4) like this the preprocessor finds the sqlite3.h header for version 3.7.4 in /usr/local/include/, but the linker fails as it's looking in /usr/lib/libsqlite3.so for the symbols.</p>

<p>Of course I can specify the lib directory and it links the correct version of the library.</p>

<pre><code>$ gcc -Wall test.c -o cpp -L/usr/local/lib -lsqlite3

<p>It seems by default gcc looks in /usr/local/include/ before /usr/include/ for headers, but not for libraries when linking. Why?</p>

<p>visual studio is automatically inserting 'object' after I type <code>new {</code> to give me:</p>

<p>These titles have an unknown amount of content and so need to cover multiple lines.</p>

<p>If this was a table cell then <code>myCell.numberOfLines = 0</code> would work (along with <code>estimatedHeightForRowAtIndexPath</code> returning <code>UITableViewAutomaticDimension</code>).  But I can't get anything similar to work with table headers.</p>

<p>I've tried setting <code>textLabel.numberOfLines = 0</code> in <code>viewForHeaderInSection</code> and/or in <code>willDisplayHeaderView</code>.  I've also tried setting it in a custom subclass I've created that the headers are using (set up with <code>let sectionHeader = tableView.dequeueReusableHeaderFooterViewWithIdentifier(""myIdentifier"") as MyTableSectionHeaderSubclass</code>).  In that subclass I've tried setting <code>textLabel.numberOfLines = 0</code> in the <code>init</code> function, as well as in <code>layoutSubviews()</code></p>

<p>I've already set the correct height of each header by calculating the amount of space the text string will take up (using <code>CGSizeMake</code> in <code>heightForHeaderInSection</code>, can provide more info about this if it's of any help).  So, there's enough vertical space for the labels to expand - they're just stuck on one line, with their text cut off and ending with an ellipsis.</p>

<p>I'm trying this approach in order to avoid using a custom UILabel to display the title.  While I can apply multiline that way, this brings other problems such as label position/frame being lost when table rows are added or deleted.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if multi-line text is even possible with a <code>UITableViewHeaderFooterView</code>'s built-in <code>textLabel</code>?  Or is a custom <code>UILabel</code> my only option?</p>

<p>Many thanks!</p>

<p><strong>What I would like to do is build the codebase itself into a Windows DLL that I can then reference from C# and write a wrapper around it to access some parts of it programatically.</strong> </p>

<p>I have tried this approach with the very simple ""hello world"" example at <a href=""http://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/dll.html"">http://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/dll.html</a> and it doesn't seem to work. </p>

{
  printf (""Hello World!\n"");
 return 42;
}

<p>I believe I should be able to reference a DLL built with the above code in C# using something like: </p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(""kernel32.dll"")]
public static extern IntPtr LoadLibrary(string dllToLoad);

[DllImport(""kernel32.dll"")]
public static extern IntPtr GetProcAddress(IntPtr hModule, string procedureName);

[DllImport(""kernel32.dll"")]
public static extern bool FreeLibrary(IntPtr hModule);


[UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
private delegate int hello();

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var path = Path.Combine(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory, ""helloworld.dll"");
    IntPtr pDll = LoadLibrary(path);
    IntPtr pAddressOfFunctionToCall = GetProcAddress(pDll, ""hello"");

    hello hello = (hello)Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(
                                                                pAddressOfFunctionToCall,

    int theResult = hello();
    Console.WriteLine(theResult.ToString());
    bool result = FreeLibrary(pDll);
    Console.ReadKey();
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this approach doesn't seem to work. <strong>LoadLibrary returns null</strong>. It can find the DLL (helloworld.dll), it is just like it can't load it or find the exported function.</p>

<p>I am sure that if I get this basic case working I can reference the rest of my codebase in this way. Any suggestions or pointers, or does anyone know if what I want is even possible? Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Examined my DLL with Dependency Walker (great tool, thanks) and it seems to export the function correctly. Question: should I be referencing it as the function name Dependency Walker seems to find (_Z5hellov)?

<p><strong>Edit 4</strong> Thanks everyone for the help, I managed to get it working. Oleg's answer gave me the information I needed to find out what I was doing wrong. </p>

<p><strong>There are 2 ways to do this.</strong> One is to build with the gcc -mno-cygwin compiler flag, which builds the dll without the cygwin dll, basically as if you had built it in MingW. Building it this way got my hello world example working! However, MingW doesn't have all the libraries that cygwin has in the installer, so if your POSIX code has dependencies on these libraries (mine had heaps) you can't do this way. And if your POSIX code didn't have those dependencies, why not just build for Win32 from the beginning. So that's not much help unless you want to spend time setting up MingW properly.</p>

<p>The other option is to build with the Cygwin DLL. The Cygwin DLL needs an initialization function init() to be called before it can be used. This is why my code wasn't working before. The code below loads and runs my hello world example.</p>

<pre><code>    //[DllImport(@""hello.dll"", EntryPoint = ""#1"",SetLastError = true)]
    //static extern int helloworld(); //don't do this! cygwin needs to be init first

    [DllImport(""kernel32"", CharSet = CharSet.Ansi, ExactSpelling = true, SetLastError = true)]
    static extern IntPtr GetProcAddress(IntPtr hModule, string procName);

    [DllImport(""kernel32"", SetLastError = true)]
    static extern IntPtr LoadLibrary(string lpFileName);


    public delegate int MyFunction();

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        //load cygwin dll
        IntPtr pcygwin = LoadLibrary(""cygwin1.dll"");
        IntPtr pcyginit = GetProcAddress(pcygwin, ""cygwin_dll_init"");
        Action init = (Action)Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(pcyginit, typeof(Action));
        init(); 

        IntPtr phello = LoadLibrary(""hello.dll"");
        IntPtr pfn = GetProcAddress(phello, ""helloworld"");
        MyFunction helloworld = (MyFunction)Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(pfn, typeof(MyFunction));

        Console.WriteLine(helloworld());
        Console.ReadKey();
    }

"16046178","1","","","2013-04-16 20:12:03","","2","201","<p>I'm building an MVC app in which the user will have the possibilities of using a lot of filters to get exactly what he wants.</p>

<p>Here's an overview of those filters based on the controller method:</p>

<pre><code>//
// GET: /Card/SearchIndex
public ActionResult SearchIndex(string objName, string objType, string objCostSymbol, string objCost, string powerSymbol,
                                        string powerValue, string ratingSymbol, string ratingValue, string ownerName, string objSet, 
                                        string objRarity, string addCostValue, int? objNumber,
                                        string addCostValue2, string addCostValue3, string addCostValue4, string addCostValue5, string addCostValue6,
                                        bool? blueColor, bool? redColor, bool? yellowColor, bool? purpleColor, bool? greyColor, bool? blackColor,
                                        bool? musicColor, bool? allColor)
        {
             // MORE CODE HERE...
        }
</code></pre>

<p>I want to know how would be the best way to deal with all these filters, and how could I get a List of objInfo based on the given parameters. Keep in mind that some values may be null. All I've done up to now is load ""all"" the objInfo I could, then sort them by removing the non-wanted item, which is in my sense ""not smart"", but I'm new to MVC App and I'm trying to find a better way to do this.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Here's the view that generates the data:</p>

<pre><code>@using System.Web.Mvc.Html

"19308064","1","","","2013-10-10 23:44:56","","0","435","<p>OK- I have been wrestling with this issue for a couple days now. I've searched google and stackoverflow and other places and I've tried lots of things to try to make this work but no luck thus far. I attribute this to my noob-ness to php and mysql, as I've probably misplaced a } or done something out of order in the code.</p>

<p>The scenario: I am trying to use a form to generate a search query and display the results. This is attempting to search my single-table database. Also, this is all on a closed network, so I'm not worried right now about injection/security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>The problem originated when I was trying to write the search function and got to learn about how you can't use $_POST anymore because it's a superglobal.</p>

<p>Right now it's not generating any errors when I try to use the search form, so I'm really stumped as to how to get it to work. </p>

<p>EDIT: I'm recycling a lot of the code from the form I used to create the records. Hopefully that isn't a mistake. </p>

<p>Here's the code: </p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?php
if(isset($_POST['search']))
{
$dbhost = 'localhost';
$dbuser = 'root';
$dbpass = '';
$conn = mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass);

{
  die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
}

   $Date = addslashes ($_POST['Date']);
   $Category = addslashes ($_POST['Category']);
   $Disc = addslashes ($_POST['Disc']);
}
else
{
   $Client =  ($_POST['Client']);
   $Product =  ($_POST['Product']);
   $Type =  ($_POST['Type']);
   $Date =  ($_POST['Date']);
   $Category =  ($_POST['Category']);
   $Disc =  ($_POST['Disc']);
}
//search function!
function search_designarchive($_post) {
    $Client = $_post['Client'];
    $Product = $_post['Product'];
    $Type = $_post['Type'];
    $Date = $_post['Date'];
$Category = $_post['Category'];
$Disc = $_upost['Disc'];

    //is this where 'real escaping' should be?
    mysql_select_db('desarch');
$query = ""SELECT * FROM designarchive"";

<p>Hers my question: can drop the <code>FindByOne()</code> statement and simply use <code>$em-&gt;merge()</code> instead of <code>$em-&gt;persist()</code></p>

<p>Am i right in thinking that the <code>$em-&gt;merge</code> sets the entity to either update or insert depending on whether the id exists or not? making my extra call to he repo unnecessary?</p>

I have included the bundle as a Liberty feature (awesome.test.feature) and I have it installed on a WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile V8.5.5. I also have an OSGI bundle (awesometest) that is a part of an OSGI application (awesometest.app) and it has an Activator class.</p>

<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/RlbYrvj"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is a picture of my workspace setup</a></p>

<p>What I want to do is call methods in testlibrary.jar through methods in awesome.test, which includes testlibrary.jar in its build path. My awesome.test.feature is available to any applicaions running on my Liberty server. I want my applications to be able to use that feature to gain access to the functionality in testlibrary.jar through what I provide in awesome.test. I don't want OSGI applications to directly import packages from testlibrary.jar.</p>

<p>The following error appears in the binary logs when I run the application on the server:</p>

<p>CWWKZ0402E: A bundle exception was generated when trying to install the application awesometest.app into an OSGi framework.  The error text from the OSGi framework is: Exception in awesometest.Activator.start() of bundle awesometest.</p>

<p>Debugging the problem finds that this exception is thrown:</p>

<p>java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: testlibrary.test.TestAPI</p>

<p>Source from TestLibraryRunner.java in awesome.test:</p>

<pre><code>package awesome.test;

import testlibrary.test.TestAPI;

public class TestLibraryRunner { 

    public static void runNonLibTest() {
        System.out.println(""No Library code is being called"");
    }

    public static void runLibTest() {
        TestAPI ta = new TestAPI(""This is a message."");
        ta.display();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that runNonLibTest() will work when called from the OSGI application. Calling the TestAPI code in runLibTest from the OSGI application will cause the error above.</p>

<p>Source from Activator.java in awesometest:</p>

<pre><code>public class Activator implements BundleActivator {

    public void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception {

        System.out.println(""Finishing..."");
    }

    public void stop(BundleContext context) throws Exception {

    }

}

<p>In summary, my OSGI application cannot touch code from the jar in the build path of the bundle included in my Liberty feature. Is there something fundamental I'm missing here? Is what I'm trying to do even possible?</p>

"27079064","1","","","2014-11-22 15:29:00","","1","552","<p>I'm concerned with the design of an adaptive jitter buffer that increases and decreases capacity with increases and decreases in the jitter calculation.</p>

<p>I see no reason to make any adjustments to latency or capacity unless there is a buffer underrun which might then be followed by a burst of incoming packets that exceeds capacity (assuming buffer capacity equals buffer depth/latency in the first place).  As an example, if I'm receiving 20ms packets, I might well implement a buffer that is 100ms deep and therefore has capacity for 5 packets.  If 160ms passes between packets, then I might be expecting to see as many as 8 packets come in nearly all at once.  I have two choices at this point:</p>

<ol>
<li>drop three of the packets according to the rules of overflow</li>
<li>drop no packets and increase buffer capacity as well as latency</li>
</ol>

<p>Assume choice 2 and that network conditions improve and packet delivery becomes regular again (the jitter value drops).  Now what?  Again, I think I have two choices:</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>do nothing and live with the increased latency</li>
<li>reduce latency (and capacity)</li>
</ol>

<p>With an adaptive buffer, I think I'm supposed to make choice 4, but that doesn't seem right because it requires that I artificially/arbitrarily drop packets of audio that were specifically saved when I took choice 2 upon encountering the greater jitter in the first place.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the correct course of action is to initially take choice #1 to maintain latency while dropping packets, if necessary, that are delivered late due to increased jitter.</p>

<p>A similar scenario might be that instead of getting a burst of 8 packets after the 160ms gap, I only get 5 (perhaps 3 packets were just lost).  In that case, having increased the buffer capacity doesn't do much of any good but does serve to reduce the potential of overflow later on.  But if the idea of overflow is something to be avoided (from the network side), then I would simply make buffer capacity some fixed amount greater than the configured 'depth/latency' in the first place.  In other words, if overflow is not something caused by the local application failing to get packets out of the buffer in a timely manner, then overflow can only happen for two reasons: either the sender lies and sends packets at a faster rate than agreed upon (or sends packets from the future), or, there is a gap between packet bursts that exceeds my buffer depth.</p>

<p>Clearly, the whole point of the 'adaptive' buffer would be to recognize the latter condition, increase buffer capacity, and avoid dropping any packets.  But that brings me right to the stated problem: how do I 'adapt' back to the ideal settings when network jitter clears up while still enforcing the same 'drop no packets' philosophy?</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I would like something like this (which works):</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import tweepy
consumer_key = 'secret'
consumer_secret = 'secret'
access_token = 'secret'
access_token_secret = 'secret'
# OAuth process, using the keys and tokens
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth)
trends1 = api.trends_place(1)

print trends1

<p>That gives a massive JSON string,</p>

<p>I would like to extract each trend name to a variable, in string format <code>str(trendsname)</code> ideally.</p>

<p>Which would ideally have the names of trends like so:
    <code>trendsname = str(trend1) + "" "" +str(trend2) + "" ""</code>
and so on, for each of the trend names.</p>

    $('.dataTables_length select option').each(function(){

<pre><code>/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_01/bin/keytool -delete -alias app -keystore keystore.jks.test

<p>I then restarted GlassFish.</p>

<p>Then I navigated to the SSL site on my browser but got the same Invalid Certificate warning.</p>

<p>When I use the browsers ""View Certificate"" option and look at the ""Thumbprint"" the hex key matches the old ""app"" key from the keystore, i.e. GlassFish doesn't seem to be picking up the new keystore.</p>

It does involve a native call and remote resources; thus, I really want to be able to tightly control this processing using my own threadpool/queue.</p>

<p>My initial implementation uses a ThreadPoolExecutor which is accessible from my ChannelHandler.  Once my handler identifies a message that requires special handling, I submit my Worker to the Executor for processing.  Note, I did see the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14593192/conditional-executionhandler-in-pipeline/14597416#14597416"">post</a> about extending the ExecutionHandler and filtering at that point, but think I would still have the same issue.</p>

<p><strong>The issue being</strong> that after the worker process completes, I would like the message to continue in the ExecutionHandler/ThreadPool defined in my pipeline.  Thus, freeing up the ""worker"" thread; again the worker threadpool has tight restrictions in terms of queue size, max threads, etc.</p>

<p>Below is my Worker (inner class of my ChannleHandler).  Towards the bottom, I get the ExecutionHandler used in the pipeline and call the handleUpstream method.  Seems to work for me, but wondering if there are any hidden issues that I am not considering...</p>

It works correctly but quite slow and require constant Internet connetion to work.  Each button clicked or any event triggered will require the browser to connect to the Web Server (Intraweb).</p>

<p>I am thinking of creating an offline web application using Intraweb in Delphi XE2, HTML5 cache manifest feature, and use the browser-based SQL storage (such as webSQL or IndexedDB) as local browser storage when the mobile device goes offline.  It will only connect to real DataSnap server when Internet connection is available to do initialization or synchronization back to the DataSnap Server.</p>

<p>Is is possible?</p>

<p>My main problem is to get the webpages' url out from the intraweb web application, and I do not want to put all the browser's storage code inside the template files.</p>

<p>It is also quite tedious to move the JavaScript code generated by Intraweb to other js files, and by doing this I may break the Intraweb application codes and logic.  Is there any workaround on this?</p>

<pre><code>struct s_molecule
{
  std::string res_name;
  std::vector&lt;t_particle&gt; my_particles;
  std::vector&lt;t_bond&gt; my_bonds;
  std::vector&lt;t_angle&gt; my_angles;

    my_bonds = to_assign.my_bonds;
    my_angles = to_assign.my_angles;
    my_dihedrals = to_assign.my_dihedrals;
    return *this;
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>and these structures:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct s_particle
{
  t_coordinates position;
  double charge;
  double mass;
  std::string name;
  std::vector&lt;t_lj_param&gt;::iterator my_particle_kind_iter;

    particle_2 = to_assign.particle_2;
    my_bond_kind_iter = to_assign.my_bond_kind_iter;
    return *this;
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>and then in my code I return a pointer to an s_molecule (typedef'd to t_molecule, but still).</p>

<p>Using this pointer I can get this code to work:</p>

<pre><code>for  (unsigned int i = 0;
      i &lt; current_molecule-&gt;my_particles.size();
      i++)
    {
      std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Particle "" 
        &lt;&lt; current_molecule-&gt;my_particles[i].name &lt;&lt; std::endl
            &lt;&lt; ""Charge: "" 
        &lt;&lt; current_molecule-&gt;my_particles[i].charge &lt;&lt; std::endl
        &lt;&lt; ""Mass: "" 
        &lt;&lt; current_molecule-&gt;my_particles[i].mass &lt;&lt; std::endl
        &lt;&lt; ""Particle Kind Name: "" 
        &lt;&lt; (*current_molecule-&gt;my_particles[i].my_particle_kind_iter).atom_kind_name

        &lt;&lt; ""z: "" &lt;&lt; current_molecule-&gt;my_particles[i].position.z
    #endif
        &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If I replace it with:</p>

<pre><code>for  (std::vector&lt;t_particle&gt;::iterator it = current_molecule-&gt;my_particles.begin();
      it !=current_molecule-&gt;my_particles.end();
      it++)
    {
      std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Particle "" 
        &lt;&lt; (*it).name &lt;&lt; std::endl
            &lt;&lt; ""Charge: "" 
        &lt;&lt; (*it).charge &lt;&lt; std::endl
        &lt;&lt; ""Mass: "" 
        &lt;&lt; (*it).mass &lt;&lt; std::endl
        &lt;&lt; ""Particle Kind Name: "" 
        &lt;&lt; (*(*it).my_particle_kind_iter).atom_kind_name 
        &lt;&lt; std::endl

        &lt;&lt; "" y: "" &lt;&lt; (*it).position.y
    #ifdef USE_3D_GEOM
        &lt;&lt; ""z: "" &lt;&lt; (*it).position.z
    #endif
        &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I now get nasty segfaults...</p>

<p>Not to put too much here, but I'm also getting segfaults when I tried to do this:</p>

<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Bond ATOMS : "" 
          &lt;&lt; (*current_molecule).my_bonds[0].particle_1-&gt;name
          &lt;&lt; std::endl
</code></pre>

<p>Again, current_molecule is a pointer to a s_molecule structure, which contains arrays of structures, which in turn either directly have vars or are pointers.  I can't get these multiple layers of indirection to work.  Suggestions on fixing these segfaults.</p>

<p>FYI I'm compiling on Linux Centos 5.4 with g++ and using a custom makefile system.</p>

<p>The problem is, when I input numbers, the chart displays perfectly (showing my two input numbers as the two components of a pie equal to their sum), but when I try to feed it dynamic data, it seems to PICK UP the data but NOT USE it correctly -- instead displaying the two numbers as slivers in an otherwise blank chart. Code examples:</p>

<p>This works perfectly, turning into a pretty pie chart with the correct values (sold and left, below):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""chart_div""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""https://www.google.com/jsapi""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
  google.load(""visualization"", ""1"", {packages:[""corechart""]});
  google.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);
  function drawChart() {
    var sold = 406;
    var left = 38; 
    var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
      ['Pounds', 'Sold/Left'],
      ['Pounds Sold', sold],
      ['Left', left]
    ]);

    var options = {

    };

    var chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('chart_div'));
    chart.draw(data, options);
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This, however, produces a chart with a hover showing (in this case) the exact same numbers (406, and 38), but the two chart sections are extremely small, accounting for about 1% of the chart's volume (as opposed to the ideal 100%). The remaining 99ish% of the chart is blank:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""chart_div"" data-sold=&lt;%= @animal.pounds_sold.to_i %&gt; data-left=&lt;%= @animal.pounds_left.to_i %&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
// Here, the numbers equal 406 and 38, as in the above. 

&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""https://www.google.com/jsapi""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
  google.load(""visualization"", ""1"", {packages:[""corechart""]});
  google.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);
  function drawChart() {
    var sold = $(document).find('#chart_div').attr('data-sold');
    var left = $(document).find('#chart_div').attr('data-left');
    var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
      ['Pounds', 'Sold/Left'],
      ['Pounds Sold', sold],
      ['Left', left]
    ]);

    var options = {

    };

    var chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('chart_div'));
    chart.draw(data, options);
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>One possible clue is that when I hover over the sections in this erroring chart, although the hover says the right numbers (406, 38), it says these sections account for only 1 and 0.2 percent of the pie, respectively, even though the rest of the pie is blank (and has no hover/hover value). </p>

<p>Any ideas what's going on here? I'm guessing I'm committing some javascript/jquery crime, cause I'm fairly new to it, but I don't know what. </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT -- Another weird thing. I tried to see what would happen in a hybrid scenario with both dynamic numbers and straight numbers, i.e the below modification to the dynamic version above:</p>

<pre><code>...
var other = 50;
var sold = $(document).find('#chart_div').attr('data-sold');
var left = $(document).find('#chart_div').attr('data-left');
var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
  ['Pounds', 'Sold/Left'],
  ['Pounds Sold', sold],
  ['Left', left],
  ['Test', other]
]);
...
</code></pre>

<p>This, inexplicably (to me), led to NO CHART AT ALL.</p>

- I'd like to store the latest entries (let's say max. 100 per user) in Redis (a list with combination of LPUSH and LTRIM). What to store? HTML output? Only IDs from PGSQL database? My idea was to store only IDs.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

The app is based in a two activies: one general and other for weather detail with a fragment inside.</p>

<p>I've been experimenting with menu creation and I have and issue that I would like to comment with you all.</p>

<p>AFAIK, If I want to share an option between different fragments, it seems a good idea to put that option in the activity menu instead of the fragment menu, so that's what I'm doing with the Share button.
But I've seen that I have two possible situations:</p>

<p>1) If the menu item inside the xml is declared as showAsAction = never I can create the instance of the ShareActionProvider and the intent inside the onOptionsItemSelected, within the corresponding if sentence (and works fine):</p>

<pre><code>public class DetailActivity extends Activity {

ShareActionProvider mShareActionProvider;  

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_detail);

    getActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);

    if (savedInstanceState == null) {
        getFragmentManager().beginTransaction().add(R.id.container, new DetailFragment()).commit();
    }
}

@Override
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {

    // Inflate the menu; this adds items to the action bar if it is present.
    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.detail, menu);
    return true;
}

@Override
public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
    // Handle action bar item clicks here. The action bar will
    // automatically handle clicks on the Home/Up button, so long
    // as you specify a parent activity in AndroidManifest.xml.
    int id = item.getItemId();
    if (id == R.id.action_settings) {
        startActivity(new Intent(this, SettingsActivity.class));
        return true;
    }
    if (id == R.id.action_share) {
        mShareActionProvider = (ShareActionProvider) item.getActionProvider();
        Intent shareIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
        shareIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_WHEN_TASK_RESET);
        shareIntent.setType(""text/plain"");
        shareIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, ""nada"");
        mShareActionProvider.setShareIntent(shareIntent);
        return true;                
    }
    return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
}
</code></pre>

<p>2) If the menu item is declared as showAsAction = always and the Share button is in the action bar, the above doesn't work as the Share button isn't even clickable. I have to declare the above code inside the onCreateOptionsMenu to make things work.
Why is that? Is different the chain of events for creating a menu when is not in the action bar Vs. when it's in it?</p>

Unfortunately they appear to be stacking in the bottom left corner of the stage and not vertically. Does anyone have an idea of why this might be? I defined my TextButton styles manually so I was thinking maybe the vertical group doesn't know how tall they are for some reason and it just stacks them on top of each other? I really don't want to make a skin because there seems to be no comprehensive way to make one. I've tried in the past and it has never worked easily. All I want to do is make one simple vertical layout with some buttons. Here is the gist of my code (I've tried many different options but this is basically it):</p>

<pre><code>vg = new VerticalGroup();
vg.setFillParent(true);
resumeButton = new TextButton(""Resume"", buttonStyle64x16);
vg.addActor(resumeButton);
// ...add more buttons...
stage.addActor(vg);

If I use "" var datastring  = $('#idForm').serialize(); "" the return doesn't work.
The variables get passed in the url, but the issue seems that the page=""+page isn't passed. Which makes the load script not work. I tried to add a hidden field in the form like:
&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""page"" value=""+page""&gt;
But, seems it's not passed as expected by the load script. The +page becomes just a string, think in the $.ajax it functions as a counter?

Any ideas?

<p>everything work great except I want to pass a string from the first view controller to the second view controller which ever one that may be.</p>

<p>As you can see I have put in the code just above detailViewController.which2 = which;</p>

<p>I have created the property and synthesized NSString *which in my first view controller and NSString *which2 in all the subsequent view controllers.  in the first instance where mission is &lt;1 everything works ok and NSLog shows the string being passed.  However with the second detailViewController (which is the variable view controller) I get the error Property 'which2' not found on object of type""_strong id'  Does anyone have any suggestion on how to resolve this?</p>

<p>the other viewControllers are gameViewController1, gameViewController2, etc.  Each is rather long and complex.  But they all load into the same xib file gameViewController.  There is a UIlabel that update to one higher once the user finishes that gameView so they can go on the the next on in the series or go back to the main menu.  If they go back to the main menu the number is added to ""gameViewController"" so the correct one is loaded.  So I can't specify which view controller is going to load since it depends on the user's place.  Thus the missionViewController with the # of mission added to load the correct view controller.   Each of the subsequent view controllers has a which2 created and synthesized.   What if we pretend that all subsequent view controllers just had a UILabel that is going to display the string ""which2 in it.  All I want to do is pass the string ""which"" to the next viewController (whichever one that is) as ""which2"".</p>

<p>when i add sprites from the binding it runs the dependency property changed callback but the properties inside the spriteToggleButton class are not updating when the control is used standalone</p>

<p>Is there a way I can have subforms for entry that will allow me to save data to the table within that same button click? Basically I want to add more entry options for the user, and while I know other ways to do it, I am particularly curious about doing it this way (if it can be done).</p>

<p>So lets say the 'parent form' is frmMain. And there are two child forms ""sub1"" and ""sub2"". Just for example sake lets say on frmMain there are two text boxes: txtTitle &amp; txtAuthor.
sub1 and sub2 both have a text Box on them that represent something like prices. The idea is Title &amp; author of a book, and then a price at each store (simplified).</p>

<p>So I tried this (because I thought it was worth a shot):</p>

<pre><code>Dim db as DAO.database
Dim sql as String


sql = ""INSERT INTO (Title, Author, PriceA, PriceB) VALUES (""

if not isnull(me.txtTitle) then
    sql = sql &amp; """""""" &amp; me.txtTitle &amp; """""",""
Else
    sql = sql &amp; "" NULL,""
End If

if not IsNull(me.txtAuthor) then
    sql = sql &amp; "" """""" &amp; me.txtAuthor &amp; """""",""
else
    sql = sql &amp; "" NULL,""
end if

if not IsNull (forms!sub1.txtPrice) then
    sql = sql &amp; "" """""" &amp; forms!sub1.txtPrice &amp; """""",""
else
    sql = sql &amp; "" NULL,""
end if
</code></pre>

<p>without finishing the code, i think you may see the GOTCHA i am headed for. I tried this and got an ""Access cannot find the form """"  "". I think I can pretty much see why on this approach too, because when I click the button that calls the new sub form into the parent form, the values that were just entered are not held/saved as sub1 closes and sub2 opens. 
I should mention that the idea above is not intended to be a one or the other approach, rather both sub forms used everytime. </p>

<p>so this is an example. i want to use this method (if possible) to have about 7 different sub form choices in one form, and be able to save to a table via a SQL statement.</p>

<p>I realize that there may be better ways, but I am just wondering if I can get there with this approach out of curiousity.</p>

<p>Thanks as always!</p>

<p>What are the best practices to implement such a workflow writing update (up and down) scripts in SQL language for <strong>production use</strong>? Are there any supporting tools?</p>

<p><strong>Deployment</strong> scenarios are also very important. How to automate migrations on a build server (using MSBuild, for example)?</p>

<p>However, when the user selects more files( the size also increase let say by 500MB) so when he presses download the zipping starts on server. The web page is hanging and the user can't do anything until the zipping process has completed. </p>

<p>Sometimes the browser (like Chrome) gives messages (process is taking too long , kill this process). So I am looking for some help here.</p>

<p>I need a solid suggestion  </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>my code for zipping the file is:</p>

<pre><code>public string Zip(string f, bool original)
{

    string zip = """";
    try
    {
        files = HttpContext.Current.Server.UrlDecode(files);
        string[] fileCollection = files.Split('*');
        zipFile = class1.zipfile(fileCollection, IsOriginal);


        int fileLength = files.Length;
    }

    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Exception during processing {0}"", ex);


    }
    return File;

<p>I have an app correctly running on device and simulator using iOS 5 but when I try it on a iOS6 device or simulator I have a weird situation. A black bar appears at the top of the screen between the navigation bar and my tableview.</p>

<p>I did some research, others have the same problem but, what solved their problem didn't work for me.
See: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12547570/black-bar-between-navigation-bar-and-table-view-appears-on-ios-6"">Black bar between navigation bar and table view appears on iOS 6</a></p>

<p>I'm facing this problem since I upgraded my xcode version to 4.5 and the iOS6 SDK. See the following screenshots of the simulator, firstly running iOS6 then iOS5. The weird thing is that the black bar is here just after the application is launched. If I changed tab (obviously viewcontrollers are switched) then the black bar is no longer present.</p>

<p>I try to change the first viewController by switching the element of my tabBar but the same situation appears even if I put the tab called ""Tendances"" in first. The black bar is on this view but not on the others.</p>

<p>I have made these screenshots on the iphone 3 simulator but using iphone4 or 5 simulator or a real device didn't resolve my issue.</p>

<p><strong>Screenshot 1</strong>: I launch the application on a iOS6 simulator. You may see that the black bar is betwen the navigation bar and the tableView header.</p>

<p><img src=""http://imageshack.us/a/img40/3883/39381540.png"" alt=""Screenshot 1""></p>

<p><strong>Screenshot 2</strong>: I'm still running the same app on the same simulation (iOS6), I decided to switch tab, using the tabBarController. The black bar disappear.</p>

<p><img src=""http://imageshack.us/a/img833/7802/19961589.png"" alt=""Screenshot 2""></p>

<p><strong>Screenshot 4</strong>: I closed the simulator running iOS6 for another running iOS5. I launched the app then as you may seen there is no black bar.</p>

<p>However, I'd like ,as an output, several files as below instead of a large one. For this example, I have set only one name per file..but this should be a parameter.</p>

<p>Output file for first person:</p>

<p>What would be the preferred and most elegant approach using XSLT 1.0? Is there a way to call a chained XSLT within the XSLT so as to split the output files?</p>

<p>After some research, it seams like the best idea would be to use ActionBarSherlock and make each one of these views a ""Fragment"" inside a master ""Main"" Activity. This seams like a very easy to do thing but is causing me massive amounts of trouble (indeed, seams to be a pain for everyone from what I can find online).</p>

<p>First, my code.
<strong>ActivityMain.java</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class ActivityMain extends SherlockFragmentActivity
{
    static String CLASS_NAME = ""ActivityMain"";

    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {
        Log.v(CLASS_NAME, ""here"");
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);

        this.createMenu();
    }

    public void createMenu()
    {
        this.getSupportActionBar().setDisplayShowHomeEnabled(false);
        this.getSupportActionBar().setDisplayShowTitleEnabled(false);

        this.getSupportActionBar().setNavigationMode(ActionBar.NAVIGATION_MODE_TABS);

        Tab tab1 = getSupportActionBar()
                .newTab()
                .setText(""First tab"")
                .setTabListener(new MyTabListener&lt;FragmentOne&gt;(this, FragmentOne.class));

        getSupportActionBar().addTab(tab1);

        Tab tab2 = getSupportActionBar()
                .newTab()
                .setText(""Second tab"")
                .setTabListener(new MyTabListener&lt;FragmentTwo&gt;(this, FragmentTwo.class));

        getSupportActionBar().addTab(tab2);
    }

    public class MyTabListener&lt;T extends Fragment&gt; implements TabListener
    {

        private ActivityMain mActivity;
        private Fragment mFragment;
        private Class&lt;T&gt; mClass;

        public MyTabListener(ActivityMain activity, Class&lt;T&gt; fragmentClass)
        {
            mActivity = activity;
            mClass = fragmentClass;
        }

        @Override
        public void onTabSelected(Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft)
        {
            if (mFragment == null)
            {
                mFragment = Fragment.instantiate(mActivity, mClass.getName());
                ft.add(android.R.id.content, mFragment, null);
            }
            else
            {
                //ft.setCustomAnimations(android.R.animator.fade_in, android.R.animator.animationtest);
                ft.attach(mFragment);
            }
        }

        @Override
        public void onTabUnselected(Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft)
        {
            if (mFragment != null)
            {
                ft.detach(mFragment);
            }
        }

        @Override
        public void onTabReselected(Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft)
        {
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>FragmentOne loads just fine, no problems on that one. FragmentTwo is where the trouble begins. Here is the files:
<strong>FragmentTwo.java</strong></p>

<pre><code>package com.test;

import com.actionbarsherlock.app.SherlockFragment;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;
import android.view.LayoutInflater;
import android.view.View;
import android.view.ViewGroup;

public class FragmentTwo extends SherlockFragment
{
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        Log.v(""Test"", ""Two!"");
    }

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {
        View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.two, container, false);
        return view;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the corresponding layout looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    android:layout_width=""fill_parent""

    android:orientation=""vertical"" &gt;

    &lt;com.google.android.maps.MapView

        android:id=""@+id/mapMapView""
        android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
        android:layout_height=""0dip""
        android:layout_weight=""0.40""
        android:clickable=""true""
        android:apiKey=""MY_KEY""
    /&gt;

    &lt;LinearLayout
        xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
        style=""@android:style/ButtonBar""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content"" &gt;

        &lt;Button

            android:onClick=""refreshSightings""
            android:text=""@string/A_MAP_REFRESH_BUTTON"" /&gt;

    &lt;/LinearLayout&gt;

&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now of course this is giving me the error <em>Binary XML file line #7: Error inflating class com.google.android.maps.MapView</em></p>

<p>I have tried importing the <a href=""https://github.com/petedoyle/android-support-v4-googlemaps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/petedoyle/android-support-v4-googlemaps</a> package and replacing the already existing android-support-v4 package but when I try to run my app, it dies with the error that it can't find the ActivityMain class.</p>

<p>First question, am I even going about this in the right way? Should I be using this 1 main activity and loading all the other things in Fragments?</p>

<p>Next, if I am doing this in a correct way, is there a <em>good</em> tutorial for how to get this to work in a decent way? I can't find anything online except for other people asking the same questions and a few tutorials that haven't worked for me.</p>

<p>Basically, how can I have tabbed navigation with 2 maps in 2 different tabs?</p>

    {
        cities = (from c in context.cities

                   select new

    return Json(cities, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);
}

<code>clock_t start = clock();</code> (and similarly stop) to time it. On compilation, I get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>tex1.cu(14): error: expression preceding parentheses of apparent call must have (pointer-to-) function type`</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I missing a header file, or a compiler option?</p>

<p>Also, I tried using CUDA timers (<code>cudaEvent_t start, stop;</code>) but the elapsed time I get is 0 ms. I create start and stop, record start, do some cuda stuff, synchronize, record stop, event synchronize and measure elapsed time. This part compiles fine but gives me elapsed time as zero. </p>

<p>It is a simple kernel that I am using to test my understanding of texture memory.
The Kernel:</p>

<pre><code>    __global__ void magic(float *mean, int *clock){
    int i, tid = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    float t, sum=0.0;
    clock_t start = clock();
    if ( tid &lt; dimy )
    {
    for(i=0;i&lt;dimx; i++){
    t = tex2D( input, i, tid );
    sum = sum + t*t;
    }
    clock_t stop = clock();
    clock[tid] = (int)(stop-start);
    }

I just lost three hours of debugging time because I accidentally used F' instead of F.  In C++, the type-checker doesn't catch this kind of error because both variables are <code>Eigen::Matrix&lt;double, 2, 2&gt;</code> objects.</p>

<p>I was wondering, for the Haskell/ML/etc. people, whether if you were writing this program you would have constructed a type system where F and F' had different types?  What would that look like?  I'm basically trying to get an idea how I can outsource some logic errors onto the type checker.</p>

<p>Edit: The basis of a matrix is like the unit.  You can say 1L or however many gallons, they both mean the same thing.  Or, to give a vector example, you can say (0,1) in Cartesian coordinates or (1,pi/2) in polar.  But even though the meaning is the same, the numerical values are different.</p>

<p>Edit: Maybe units was the wrong analogy.  I'm not looking for some kind of record type where I can specify that the first field will be litres and the second gallons, but rather a way to say that this matrix as a whole, is defined in terms of some other matrix (the basis), where the basis could be any matrix of the same dimensions.  E.g., the constructor would look something like <code>mkMatrix [[1, 2], [3, 4]] [[5, 6], [7, 8]]</code> and then adding that object to another matrix would type-check only if both objects had the same matrix as their second parameters.  Does that make sense?</p>

imageView.animationDuration = 0.50;        
[imageView setAnimationRepeatCount: 1];        
[imageView startAnimating]; `
</code></pre>

<p>There is a little delay when the user pushes the button, but the animation runs great. The problem is that this method uses too much memory. </p>

<p>It’s not an option to use less or smaller images for the animations (I tried).
The images show a 3d movement so it’s not possible to just move, turn or flip the images.</p>

<p>I have been looking at OpenGL and Cocos2d but is that the right way to go?</p>

<p>However all this is for an application that users should be able to use offline, so I had to copy all the external files and move them into a subdirectory /external, e.g.</p>

    &lt;script src='/external/customEvents.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

<p>Since the change, frequently when running the server and opening localhost, one or more of the files hasn't loaded. When I switch back including the links to the online versions of the files, this doesn't happen at all and it gets progressively worse as I move more of the files offline.</p>

<p>I'm not experienced at all with servers and the like, so any guidance or hints as to what is the issue (and how I could resolve it) would be appreciated!</p>

<p>I am using two different fonts in my current project and want to enable font-feature-settings on both of them.
Currently I have to do this via the <code>*</code> selector:</p>

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>*, *:before, *:after {
  -webkit-font-feature-settings: ""kern"", ""liga"", ""pnum"" ""ss01"";

          font-feature-settings: ""kern"", ""liga"", ""pnum"" ""ss01"";
}

<p>So far so good; this way I set kerning, ligatures and proportional numbers as a default. The problem is the alternative stylistic set.
I want to have this one on every instance of <strong>one</strong> of my fonts. The other font has another stylistic set, which I do not want to use.</p>

<p>My prefered way would be to incorporate defaults in the <code>@font-face</code> like this:</p>

<p>My form action is empty but the onSubmit is this:</p>

<pre><code>function validateInput()
    {

                        document.forms['orderform'].woonplaats.value == """" ||

            document.orderform.action =""index.php?page=pizza_bestelling"";
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So whenever 1 of those 5 fields is empty the action will be <code>index.php?page=pizzaorder</code> if all is well the action will be <code>index.php?page=pizza_bestelling</code> this is all working just as it should. However if one of those fields is empty, it will submit to itself which is page=pizzaorder. </p>

<p>(the reason i can't use <code>$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']</code> is because i'm using an include menu. Which means i am always on the same page, it will just include different files based on menu options. So if i were to use <code>$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']</code> i would be send to the default index.php which would be my homepage, which isn't what i want)</p>

<p>Anyway, if one of those fields isn't filled it will send to the same page with the error messages next to the field that is empty, which is working fine as well.:</p>

<pre><code>if ($_SERVER[""REQUEST_METHOD""] == ""POST"")
 {
    if (empty($_POST[""naam""]))
    {$naamErr = ""Vul uw naam in"";}
    else
    {$naam = test_name($_POST[""naam""]);}

    if (empty($_POST[""woonplaats""]))
    {$woonplaatsErr = ""Vul uw Woonplaats in"";}
    else
    {$woonplaats = test_name($_POST[""woonplaats""]);}

    if (empty($_POST[""straatnaam""]))
    {$straatErr = ""Vul uw straat in"";}
    else
    {$straatnaam = test_name($_POST[""straatnaam""]);}

    if (empty($_POST[""huisnummer""]))
    {$huisnummerErr = ""Vul uw Huisnummer in"";}
    else
    {$huisnummer = test_name($_POST[""huisnummer""]);}

    if (empty($_POST[""telefoonnummer""]))
    {$telefoonErr = ""Vul uw Telefoonnummer in"";}
    else
    {$telefoonnummer = test_name($_POST[""telefoonnummer""]);}
}
</code></pre>

<p>However all fields are empty if this happens, which is NOT what i want. If the user fills in correctly all his info but forgets his, let's say, street he only sees the error message Street is required, but all his other data is empty as well. Only difference is there is no error message.</p>

<p>So what i want is that if he gets sent back to this page with the error messages, the other info shouldn't be empty as well.</p>

<p>I hope it's somewhat clear what my problem is, otherwise feel free to ask for clarification!</p>

<p>Also I've surfed the web but considering are ""variable"" rows, in other words every time changes it may have 4 elements class '1' or 5, or 6 etc...
I thought in making a loop with a counter, but I'm not able to get 1 element.</p>

It is a kind of log file. To do this I should improve the timestamp resolution to microsecs(I do not think is possible for pg write a million of records in a sec). This kind of precision is possible for postgres.<a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/datatype-datetime.html"" rel=""nofollow"">See here</a> It is something like this:</p>

  blabla bigint,

<p>But it does not work. When I check, with pgAdmin3, it writes ever with millisecs precision.
And of course , it is possible write more records in the same millisecond.
So, did I need to set some misterious variable or something else, in order to save with microsecs precision?</p>

<p>Now what I really want, instead of MySQL, is to have an embedded database running HSQL or H2. So I’ve working on my own project trying to implement such a system.</p>

<p>In the tutorial code, he creates a database. And then h2 + hibernates creates the future tables for him – so it would be create if I could do this without having to have an sql schema or anything to set it up. 
 So I’ve gotten rid of mySql maven dependencies and am working on replacing the persistence-beans.xml
Now I have to replace my dataSource with a relevant h2 or hsql version.
So this is what I’ve gotten.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""dataSource"" class=""org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource""
    destroy-method=""close""&gt;

    &lt;property name = ""username"" value = ""sa"" /&gt;
    &lt;property name = ""password"" value = """" /&gt; 
&lt;/bean&gt;

// I also tried this (but again, having a schema with his code is tricky I’ve found

&lt;jdbc:embedded-database id=""dataSource"" type=""H2""&gt;
    &lt;jdbc:script location=""classpath:schema.sql""/&gt;
    &lt;jdbc:script location=""classpath:test-data.sql""/&gt;
&lt;/jdbc:embedded-database&gt;

<p>But it fails upon running HibernateConfigurationTest.Java (and in extension – all the others)
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I've managed to get this test work with my schema </p>

<p>This sets post excerpt length universally across the site.  However, for a specific page ID, Id like to display full length of the post.  </p>

<p>My thought is to include and elseif similar to:</p>

<pre><code>function my_excerpt_length($len) {

"13920823","1","","","2012-12-17 19:30:24","","3","328","<p>We developed a site using JSF 2 running on jBoss EAP 6.0, we are having problems in our production environment that basically after a period of time (with current levels of users about 24 hrs) the application makes the server load average go up to 100 and the server kind of stops responding (it actually doesn't stop responding it just takes too long to response so in practicall terms it's the same)</p>

<p>Now if we just stop and start jBoss again the application works fine (so it's not a problem of load but more something that happens over time, the more load the faster it happens) </p>

<p>In order to test this we created a simple application (just a war) that basically has a login page, and s very simple page that renders some text with a button and a simple popup that also just renders some text.</p>

<p>We are using jMeter  (running in another machine) to stress this simple application hitting it with 100 concurrent threads (or as concurrent as jMeter allows anyway). The jBoss EAP running on a Mac with i5 and 8gb of ram (using 4gb for the server) lasts around 20 minutes before escalating load average to 50 and continus climbing, If instead of 100 I use 200 threads </p>

<p>The other thing I noticed is that If I start testing with a fresh jBoss instance it takes X amount of time for the load average to escalate, now, If I start a test, get the load average up to say 50, then stop that test and start a new test without restarting jBoss the Load Average spikes in seconds to a 50 again.</p>

<p>We can stress our services using the Restful services without problems (and no load average spikes) so we are guessing that it's not a general jBoss issue but more of a JSF issue. </p>

<p>I'm uploading some images of Visual VM as a reference (where you can see that GC is done periodically and looks fine and the curb of both CPU and load average escalation) and the contents of the pom.xml for library versions.</p>

<p>So my questions are basically has anyone encountered this problem? is this normal behaviour? can anyone think of a reason for this happening? (we have also created a ticket with RedHat support but we are hopping that someone in the community had already faced this issue or could help us figure out a way to find out wht's happening)</p>

<p>I can provide the code of the sample application and the jMeter test script if anyone is interested </p>

<p>As maple_shaft suggested I tested this in on glassfish getting an entirely different result, I configured a base glassfish server just changing Xmx Xms and NewSize and ran the test with 200 threads and the load average never spiked over 6 (actually it stayed around 5 in what i'm guessing is the confort zone for the load)</p>

<p>I'm adding the result images and will update RH support case accordingly</p>

When I change parameters in that sample drawing it gets larger . That drawing needs to be displayed in scroll view (it doesn't need to be shrinked to fit the screen). This is the code I used:</p>

<p><strong>DrawPoints.java</strong></p>

<pre><code>    public class DrawPoints extends myActivity {


    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.routes); 

    }

    public static class SampleView extends View {
        private Paint   mPaint = new Paint();
        private float[] mPts;

       /*here comes declaration of parametars



        private void buildPoints() {

        /*here comes some coding*/

            }
        }

        public SampleView(Context context, AttributeSet attributeset) {
            super(context, attributeSet);

            buildPoints();
        }

        @Override 
        protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
            Paint paint = mPaint;

            //here also comes code
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>here is xml Code:</p>

<p><strong>routes.xml</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
    &lt;ScrollView 
            xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""

                android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
                android:layout_height=""fill_parent""&gt;

                    &lt;!-- This code is just to make sure that scroll views work how

        &lt;/HorizontalScrollView&gt;
    &lt;/ScrollView&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I run that application and push the button in main activity application crashes. 
Drawing looks like Figure1 when I'm not using xml layout or scrollviews:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/za5MP.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.stack.imgur.com/za5MP.png</a>
         <strong>Figure1</strong></p>

<p>I also tried to use this code after method setContentView:</p>

<pre><code>View v = new SampleView(this);
addContentView(v, new ViewGroup.LayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.FILL_PARENT,
            ViewGroup.LayoutParams.FILL_PARENT));
</code></pre>

<p>and also this one:</p>

<pre><code>View v = new SampleView(this);
    ScrollView.LayoutParams lp = new ScrollView.LayoutParams(1000, 1000);

    addContentView(v, lp);
</code></pre>

<p>when I use codes, shown above, app displays Figure1 without scrollview, it seems like second content view overwrites that xml but it doesn't show correctly. 
After that I tried to use this code after setContentView:</p>

<pre><code>View v = new SampleView(this);
    FrameLayout fl = new FrameLayout(this);
    fl.findViewById(R.id.FrameLayout1);
    fl.addView(v);
</code></pre>

<p>Frame layout (FrameLayout1) is added in routes.xml file after horizontal scroll view. When application runs I get blank screen without Figure1.
Does Anyone have an idea how to upgrade my code that would display Figure1 in ScrollView?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

I just noticed that it returns the same error when I try to call the fancybox gems javascript functions. Could this be related? and maybe be a general problem with my rails setup?</p>

If I have a checkbox defined as follows... </p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id=""check"" type=""checkbox""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... how can I get an image from a directory, and display it in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> based on the current state of the checkbox (without messing with the HTML)? What I've found so far is this, but this is simply for showing the existing contents of a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, correct?</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $('#check').click(function(){

(No jsf annotations are used in the whole project, only CDI annotation to avoid potential conflicts)</p>

<p>At some point in time (we don't know what triggers it) during the processing of one request the @SessionScoped bean give contradictory informations. Yet the processing occurs always in only one session and one Thread.</p>

<p>Here are log lines (simplified example) when the processing of the requests is normal (here two successive requests):</p>

<pre><code>15:00:00 : thread 1 - req 1 - OurWeirdSessionScopedBean.process.step1 : login : ""UserA"";
15:00:00 : thread 1 - req 1 - OurWeirdSessionScopedBean.process.step2 : login : ""UserA"";
15:00:00 : thread 1 - req 1 - OurWeirdSessionScopedBean.process.step3 : login : ""UserA"";
15:00:00 : thread 1 - req 1 - OurWeirdSessionScopedBean.process.step4 : login : ""UserA"";
15:00:00 : thread 1 - req 1 - OurWeirdSessionScopedBean.process.step5 : login : ""UserA"";
15:00:01 : thread 1 - req 1 - OurWeirdSessionScopedBean.process.step6 : login : ""UserA"";
15:00:01 : thread 1 - req 1 - OurWeirdSessionScopedBean.process.step7 : login : ""UserA"";

15:00:04 : thread 2 - req 2 - OurWeirdSessionScopedBean.process.step1 : login : ""UserB"";
15:00:04 : thread 2 - req 2 - OurWeirdSessionScopedBean.process.step2 : login : ""UserB"";

15:00:04 : thread 2 - req 2 - OurWeirdSessionScopedBean.process.step7 : login : ""UserB"";
</code></pre>

<p>Here are log lines when the processing of the request is ""corrupted"" (two successive requests). Watch for login value :</p>

<pre><code>16:00:00 : thread 1 - req 1 - OurWeirdSessionScopedBean.process.step1 : login : ""UserA"";
16:00:00 : thread 1 - req 1 - OurWeirdSessionScopedBean.process.step2 : login : ""UserB"";

<p>For a long time (generally 5-10 hour) all is ok, then something occurs (time / thread exhaustion / bad luck / .... ? no idea) and then the webapp is ""broken"". When it is broken, the data mismatch as illustrated above is frequent but not systematic.</p>

<p>The only solution is to reboot wildfly.</p>

<p>In the 'corrupted' state, this buggy behavior can be observed with only one user with an http session pending (no http session disconnect / connect), with only successive clicks on a button in the web page). The point is that I am positive that when the server is 'broken' the bug can be reproduced with only one user and no load.</p>

<p>Hint : OurWeirdSessionScopedBean is a managedBean backing our xhtml page, and is injected (CDI @Inject) in other CDI beans involved in the processing.</p>

<p>It seems like if the proxy for OurWeirdSessionScopedBean injected in the other CDI beans doesn't always reference the same data that the backingBean of the xhtml page. But it should be the same object. OurWeirdSessionScopedBean is annotated as @SessionScoped and @Named. </p>

<p>Did anybody encounter such a behaviour ? Does somebody have an explanation / a solution or a workaround ?</p>

<p>Many thanks</p>

The divs have a hover container over top that I would like to always be on top, but when I get to my break point (850px and below) it is hard, without precise pixels, to keep the cover on top of the container.

<p>I'm almost positive this isn't working due to the fact that the <code>covers</code> have to be absolutely positioned over the <code>case-studys</code>. Is there a better way to go about this, or can any of you help me make this work? It looks good for screen sizes 851px and higher, just need to figure out a way to get this working in mobile.</p>

<p>Here is a <strong><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/o341927q/3/"">Fiddle</a></strong> of my current problem, it may help to expand it into fullscreen.</p>

<p>Thank you for the help!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Things I have tried:</strong></p>

<p>• I have tried to make the container that holds the cover a certain width then <code>overflow:hidden</code> to hide the excess hover, but this hasn't worked.</p>

<p>• I've tried to do this with precise pixels but this has also failed me.</p>

The problem is when it starts at the first tab, it will call <code>onCreateView</code> in <code>class PlaceholderFragment</code>. When i switch to the 2nd tab, it calls it again for that tab. Now the problem starts with going back to tab1, it doesn't call <code>onCreateView</code>. Now if i go to tab3 it gets called for that tab, then go back to tab1 it <b>now</b> gets called. So tab1's <code>onCreateView</code> never gets called if i go from tab2 to tab1 but gets called going from tab3 to tab1.

<p>To clarify: After I've logged in as shown above, I would need to access a page, with the session from above, that requires you to be logged in (e.g. membersonly.php or whatever), and then read and use the content from this page in Java.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><b><code>throw;</code> inside <code>try</code>-block:</b> I've never seen this before. The only place I've thought <code>throw;</code> to be valid was inside a <code>catch</code>-block to rethrow what was caught. So what does this do? Some debugging apparently shows that the thrown exception is what was thrown previously, but that was inside a completely different <code>try</code>-block. In fact, it was even outside the <code>struct</code> declaration!</p></li>
<li><p><b>Swap fields:</b> Why do we need to <em>swap</em> the exception fields? Wouldn't just copying of the pointers be enough? Is this to prevent the structures to which the fields point at from being deleted from the heap prematurely?</p></li>
<li><p><b>Check <code>link</code> <em>and</em> <code>link</code>'s link:</b> I can understand checking that <code>link</code> is not <code>NULL</code> (even though deleting a <code>NULL</code> pointer has no effect), but why the need to check the <code>link</code>'s link?</p></li>
<li><p><b>Throw dummy exception:</b> Why is this dummy needed? It's thrown but then dropped. Why do we need this as an end to the chain?</p></li>

"3721800","1","3721856","","2010-09-15 21:07:10","","1","533","<p>In C# it is not possible to override a static method. Nevertheless I have some type specific methods (instead of the usual instance methods) and I want to give the user the ability to override those methods, and in addition, have the ability to call those (overridden) methods from my own code without knowing about the 'overriding' done by the user. Would the method be static, I would have to know the type name of the user's class in advance, which is not what I want.</p>

<p><strong>How to implement type specific methods like <code>Read</code>, <code>Write</code> and <code>GetLength</code> and allow overriding?</strong></p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>There is an abstract <code>Row</code> class whose derived types/classes represents a <em>type of row</em> and whose instance represents the actual row and its fields/data in a very simple table. Each type of row has a fixed length and the table is just a head-to-tail run of rows in a file. The <code>Row</code> class needs three methods: <code>Read</code> and <code>Write</code> methods which perform their obvious function on a stream given an offset, and a <code>GetLength</code> method which returns the fixed length of the type of row.</p>

<p>Now the user may extend my <code>Row</code> class and provide implementations for <code>Read</code>, <code>Write</code> and <code>GetLength</code> for his or her specific <em>row type</em>, and fields and properties to be used in his or her specific <em>row instance</em>. For example, the <code>SomeUserRow</code> class may have a 32-bit integer field and a single byte field, a fixed length of 5 bytes and corresponding read and write method implementation.</p>

<h2>The methods</h2>

<h3>Read</h3>

<p>An obvious factory method, related to the type and therefore I would define it in the class itself. I'd make it <code>static</code>, but then it cannot be overridden. Then I could make it <code>protected abstract</code> and create a static generic <code>Read&lt;T&gt;</code> method to call it, as suggested in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/1380087/146622"">this post</a>. But I also need to be able to call this method from my code without knowing the type of the user implemented class. I can't just call <code>Row.Read&lt;UserType&gt;()</code> because I don't know about the user's types yet.</p>

<h3>Write</h3>

<p>A possible instance method, because most people want to write an existing <code>Row</code> to the stream. But having <code>Read</code> static, it seems weird to make <code>Write</code> an instance method.</p>

<h3>GetLength</h3>

<p>Not a factory method, but still related to the type. Again, I would make it static but this prevents overriding. I can choose to make it an instance method, which <em>can</em> be overridden but it feels wrong to do that in an Object Oriented environment: creating an instance just to get a value which does not depend on the instance (<code>int length = new T().GetLength()</code>) but rather on its type.</p>

<p>I have also been thinking about moving the three methods out of the classes into a separate class, but that still does not address the overriding. Or to have a class which keeps a list or dictionary of delegates pointing to the correct methods. It does not allow for <em>real</em> overriding (replacing a method pointer in a delegate array is not what I'd consider <em>true</em> overriding) and it moves the type specific methods away from the type which I think is not good from a developers point of view: having two or more places to change when you just want to change the type.</p>

<p>Via reflection it is possible to call the correct static method on a type, but as I was reading many rows, I found it to be too slow.</p>

<p>I thought based on webpack's output section, webpack would generate a physical file in my build folder while creating a virtual file in '/static/bundle.js'</p>

<p>Currently, the virtual file with hot-loader is working, but no physical file has been built in the 'build' path.</p>

<p>Am I correct that webpack can replace gulp and generate both a physical &amp; virtual build file? If so, where is my code in err as far as creating a physical build file?</p>

I am trying to minimize the overall time required to render/display the buttons when the corresponding xib file is loaded. If I simply setup each button in turn in <code>viewDidLoad</code>, the time required for the view to appear is about 5-6 seconds, which is clearly too much.</p>

<p>In order to speed-up the buttons setup, I am using Grand Central Dispatch as follows. In <em>viewDidLoad</em>, I setup each button layers using <code>dispatch_async</code> on the global queue (adding to the base layer the shape and the gradient layers), so that the buttons can be rendered in a different thread. A the end of the block, the CATextLayer is added to the gradient layer.</p>

<p>Google App Script can be used in so many  ways. I know cause I have tried some of them but Iam not an expert so, the situation is.</p>

<p>I have created an Spreadsheet</li>
create a form using the new UI Building that comes with the script editor.
named:gtest01<br>
UI compose of:</p>

<ul>
<li>label, id=label_caption</li>
<li>button 1, id=button_hide, event-onmouseclick=hide_label</li>
<li>button 2, id=button_show, event-onmouseclick=show_label</li>
<li>button 3, id=button_message, event-onmouseclick=message_me</li>
</ul>

<p>now, the code is:</p>

<pre><code>/* This is so when I want to just deploy it as a [webapp] using the
script editor -&gt; Publish Deploy as Web App
*/
function doGet(e) {
 var app = UiApp.createApplication().setTitle(""Sheet Application"");
  app.add(app.loadComponent(""gtest01""));
  Logger.log(""Application UI Loaded"");  
  return app;
}

function message_me(e) {  
  Browser.msgBox(""my message""); 
}

function hide_label(e) {
  var app = UiApp.getActiveApplication();
  label =app.getElementById(""label_caption"");
  label.setVisible(false);
}

function show_label(e) {
  var app = UiApp.getActiveApplication();
  label =app.getElementById(""label_caption"");
  label.setVisible(true);
}

// this code is for when the spreadsheet is shared so they can access the form
function showform_() {
  var app = UiApp.createApplication();
  app.add(app.loadComponent(""gtest01""));
  SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().show(app); 
}

function onOpen() {
  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var menuEntries = [];
  menuEntries.push({name: ""Show Form"", functionName: ""showform_""});
  ss.addMenu(""e-Test"", menuEntries);
}
</code></pre>

<p>First scenario is that when spreadsheet is shared</p>

<ul>
<li>when menu is clicked the form will load - thats good</li>
<li>when show and hide button nothing happens - why and how can i fixed
this?</li>
<li>when message button is click - message will show but the form will
close, how can I display a message without closing the form?</li>
</ul>

<p>Second scenario is that when publish as Webapp.</p>

<ul>
<li>When Developer Link is Access the UI is always updated - ok</li>
<li>When URL Link is Access the UI is always updated its like it is
cache, how can I fixed this?</li>
<li>on dev link: when show and hide button nothing happens - why and how
can i fixed this?</li>
<li>on dev link: when message button is click - will generate an error,
how can I display an alert message on WebApp</li>
</ul>

<p>Please help I have search and tried the sample codes and answer in the forum am missing something.</p>

My teacher seems to be convinced that the only way to have a menu (with fixed pages like ""display"", etc) is to use case statements.
My first guess would have been to just use a function which echo's some hrefs.</p>

<p>He also keeps saying that PHP is event driven. Is this true? I was always thought the interpreter on the server went through the code and then sent the html to the browser.</p>

<p>The issue I'm having is that I have other selects defined on the page that are being modified by this process, but when I do the following:</p>

<pre><code>clonedTr.find('select').each(function() {

<p>it confirms that I am only working with the selects within the cloned table row.  See this jsfiddle: <a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/fud4wej2/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jsfiddle.net/fud4wej2/2/</a></p>

<p>I also tried to call <code>rowTemplate.remove()</code> after the <code>clone()</code>, thinking that the issue might have to do with duplicated ids, but to no avail.  Otherwise, to see the top pulldown being displayed correctly - showing <code>Foobar</code> as it's option - comment in the <code>return;</code> statement.</p>

<p>As is -- with <code>$(this).append(option);</code> commented out -- the top pulldown shows the second entry <code>WB-730-2</code> from <code>optionsToAdd</code> as its option.  If you comment in the final <code>$(this).append(option);</code> statement, the top pulldown has no options. </p>

<p>I have looked everywhere to see if I've used the wrong sqlite3 commands wrong since I'm not very familiar to it, but I tried everything I found and nothing worked. The <code>print(""hi"")</code>
 line doesn't execute, so that tells me that there are no rows in the table.</p>

<p>Also, if I say <code>db:nrows(""SELECT year, month, day FROM expenses"")</code>, sqlite3 gives me an error saying there is no year column. My overall guess is that I'm not inserting the information into the table properly, but I've tried everything I can think of. Can anyone help?</p>

UPDATE1: Marc Baumbach wrote a simple Adapter that is exactly what I need. Included below. Original question follows.</p>

<hr>

<p>A function that requires a <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Appendable.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>java.lang.Appendable</code></a> can accept a <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Writer.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>java.io.Writer</code></a>, because <code>Writer</code> implements <code>Appendable</code>.</p>

<p>What about the other way around? I am using a function that requires a writer, and I am trying to create another function that calls it, which accepts an appendable and passes it to the original writer-function.</p>

<p>I see that you can extend <code>Writer</code>, which is abstract, and redirect all <code>write(...)</code> functions to their corresponding <code>append(...)</code>-s. But you also have to implement <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Writer.html#flush%28%29"" rel=""nofollow""><code>flush()</code></a> and <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Writer.html#close%28%29"" rel=""nofollow""><code>close()</code></a>, and I'm clear on how to write those cleanly so this wrapper-class can accept <em>any</em> Appendable.</p>

<p>I'm surprised there isn't anything already out there, either on the web or stackoverflow, or in an existing library, that addresses this. At least not that I could find.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate a little guidance here. Thank you.</p>

<p>Adapter code that answers this question. Written by Marc Baumbach (my own version is below):</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.Closeable;
import java.io.Flushable;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.Writer;

public class AppendableWriterAdapter extends Writer {

      private Appendable appendable;

      public AppendableWriterAdapter(Appendable appendable) {
            this.appendable = appendable;
      }

      @Override
      public void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {
            appendable.append(String.valueOf(cbuf), off, len);
      }

      @Override
      public void flush() throws IOException {
            if (appendable instanceof Flushable) {
                  ((Flushable) appendable).flush();
            }
      }

      @Override
      public void close() throws IOException {
            flush();
            if (appendable instanceof Closeable) {
                  ((Closeable) appendable).close();
            }
      }

}

<p>Here is my own version, based on Marc's, that only uses <code>instanceof</code> only in the constructor, and a (Java 1.5) delta in <code>flush()</code> and <code>close()</code>. This is to avoid having to use any logic or reflection after object construction. This is also released as a <a href=""https://gist.github.com/aliteralmind/8494917"" rel=""nofollow"">gist</a>: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/aliteralmind/8494917"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/aliteralmind/8494917</a></p>

<p>This class contains a demo, followed by two do-nothing deltas (one <code>Flushable</code>, one <code>Closeable</code>), the main function (<code>newWriterForAppendable(apbl)</code>), and then the adapter class itself.</p>

The secondary pass-through service is a common endpoint for all public interactions.  To make it simpler, I'll call that <code>public-api</code> and the original service where the tests live <code>private-api</code></p>

<p>We're using a retrofit api to actually make the rest calls in combination with a couple hacks to make the headers more configurable.</p>

<p>The tests run fine when running as integration tests via failsafe in the <code>private-api</code>, but in the <code>public-api</code> we have a little more configuration that needs to happen programmatically before launching the tests.  To that end I've written a test method:</p>

<pre><code>@Test(groups = {""test""})
@Parameters({""xmlTestConfigFilePath""})
public void runCommonTests(String xmlTestConfigFilePath)
{
    log.info(""Launching common test library"");

    try
    {
        System.setProperty(""it.localServiceBaseUrl"", ""localhost:8080/public-endpoint"");

        TestListenerAdapter tla = new TestListenerAdapter();
        TestNG testNG = new TestNG();
        testNG.addListener(tla);
        testNG.setXmlSuites(new LinkedList&lt;&gt;(new Parser(xmlTestConfigFilePath).parse()));
        testNG.run();
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        log.error(""Exception thrown while executing common tests"", e);
        assertTrue(false);
    }
    assertTrue(true);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> xmlTestConfigFilePath is intentionally different from -DsuiteXmlFile to allow a secondary xml configuration for the common tests</p>

<p>The problem is, I'm not getting any useful output from the common tests when running this way.  Running <code>mvn clean test</code> results in the following output:</p>

<pre><code>===============================================
wfm_public_api_suite
Total tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Skips: 1
Configuration Failures: 1, Skips: 6
===============================================
</code></pre>

<p>No stack traces, nothing useful.  Is there a way to append the results of the common test run to the ""driver"" test run? add it to the session somehow?</p>

<pre><code>require 'spec_helper'
require 'rspec-rails'

#require 'shoulda-matchers'
#require 'shoulda/matchers/action_controller'

    it { should_not render_template :application }
    it { should_not render_with_layout }
    it { should_not set_the_flash }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is the controller under test:</p>

<pre><code>class StaticPagesController &lt; ApplicationController
  def home
    if signed_in?
      redirect_to user_path
    else
      render layout: false,

             formats: [:html],
             status: '404'
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>When I execute the test, the <code>respond_with</code> and <code>respond_with_content_type</code> matchers fail with</p>

<pre><code>NoMethodError: undefined method `content_type' for nil:NilClass
/home/rev/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194/gems/shoulda-matchers-\

<p>which is odd, to me, because those methods are:</p>

<pre><code>    def response_content_type
      @controller.response.content_type.to_s
    end
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>    def response_code

I am having a problem with <code>JUGGLING ASYNC</code>.
The problem is described as follows: <br />
You are given three urls as command line arguments. You are supposed to make <code>http.get()</code> calls to get data from these urls and then print them in the same order as their order in the list of arguments. 
Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>var http = require('http')
var truecount = 0;
var printlist = []
for(var i = 2; i &lt; process.argv.length; i++) {
    http.get(process.argv[i], function(response) {
    var printdata = """";
    response.setEncoding('utf8');
    response.on('data', function(data) {
        printdata += data;
    })
    response.on('end', function() {
        truecount += 1
        printlist.push(printdata)
            if(truecount == 3) {
            printlist.forEach(function(item) {
                console.log(item)
            })
            }
    })
    })
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the questions I do not understand:
I am trying to store the completed data in <code>response.on('end', function(){})</code>for each url using a dictionary. However, I do not know how to get the url for that <code>http.get()</code>. If I can do a local variable inside <code>http.get()</code>, that would be great but I think whenever I declare a variable as <code>var url</code>, it will always point to the last url. Since it is global and it keeps updating through the loop. What is the best way for me to store those completed data as the value with the key equal to the url?</p>

<p>Detail:
I know boxen is a wrapper written around puppet(correct me if I am wrong), but what is it exactly that boxen is doing that puppet cannot do?. In another words what is the difference between boxen and puppet?. I just started using boxen, have never used puppet before, but because of boxen I am also learning how to use puppet.
I have watched the boxen presentation, done by the team that created boxen <a href=""http://vimeo.com/61172067"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/61172067</a></p>

<p>In this presentation they talked about what boxen can do, but didn't really mentioned what puppet cant do that boxen can.</p>

<p>In this project it is used Structs 2 to do the dispatchment.</p>

<p>So I have done the following operations:</p>

<p>1) I create the <strong>TestPortlet1Action</strong> class into this folder: <strong>/Web/src/main/java/mypackage/actions/</strong> where I define the <strong>startTestPortlet1()</strong> method that is the starting method of my protlet (I think that this is the portlet entry point):</p>

<pre><code>package egp.prc.km.actions.testPortlet1;

import egp.prc.km.actions.KMAction;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;

@Controller(""TestPortlet1"")
@Scope(""prototype"")
public class TestPortlet1Action extends KMAction {

    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }

    public void setMessage(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    private String message;


    public String startTestPortlet1() {

        this.setMessage(""Hello World !!!"");

        return SUCCESS;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>where <strong>KMAction</strong> provde me this <strong>Action</strong> interface:</p>

<p>package com.opensymphony.xwork2;</p>

<pre><code>public interface Action  {
    java.lang.String SUCCESS = ""success"";
    java.lang.String NONE = ""none"";
    java.lang.String ERROR = ""error"";
    java.lang.String INPUT = ""input"";
    java.lang.String LOGIN = ""login"";

    java.lang.String execute() throws java.lang.Exception;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the <strong>return SUCCESS</strong> statment return the <strong>success</strong> string.</p>

<p>2) Then I have create a <strong>JSP view</strong> for this portlet named <strong>testPortlet1.jsp</strong> (into thi folder  : <strong>/Web/src/main/webapp/testPortlet1/testPortlet1.jsp</strong>):</p>

    &lt;/tr&gt;

    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;

        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>3) So now I know that I have to update the <strong>struts.xml</strong> file (that it is into <strong>Web/main/resources</strong> folder) that contains something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;struts&gt;
    &lt;constant name=""struts.objectFactory"" value=""spring""/&gt;
    &lt;constant name=""struts.devMode"" value=""false""/&gt;
    &lt;constant name=""struts.locale"" value=""en_US""/&gt;
    &lt;constant name=""struts.ognl.allowStaticMethodAccess"" value=""true""/&gt;
    &lt;constant name=""struts.custom.i18n.resources"" value=""km_international""/&gt;

    &lt;package name=""kmAjaxPackage"" extends=""struts-default"" namespace=""/""&gt;
        &lt;interceptors&gt;
            &lt;interceptor name=""liferayAjax"" class=""liferayAjaxInterceptor""/&gt;
            &lt;interceptor-stack name=""kmAjaxStack""&gt;
                &lt;interceptor-ref name=""defaultStack""/&gt;
                &lt;interceptor-ref name=""liferayAjax""/&gt;
            &lt;/interceptor-stack&gt;
        &lt;/interceptors&gt;
        &lt;default-interceptor-ref name=""kmAjaxStack""/&gt;
    &lt;/package&gt;

    &lt;include file=""chat-struts.xml""/&gt;
    ..................................
    ..................................
    ..................................
    &lt;include file=""TestPortlet1-struts.xml""/&gt;
&lt;/struts&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I have included the struts configuration file related to my hello world portlet, this one:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;include file=""TestPortlet1-struts.xml""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>4) So now I have configured the <strong>TestPortlet1-struts.xml</strong> file, in this way:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" ?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE struts PUBLIC
        ""-//Apache Software Foundation//DTD Struts Configuration 2.0//EN""
        ""http://struts.apache.org/dtds/struts-2.0.dtd""&gt;

&lt;struts&gt;

    &lt;package name=""TestPortlet1Package"" extends=""struts-portlet-default"" namespace=""/testPortlet1""&gt;
        &lt;action name=""startFocusAction"" class=""FocusAction"" method=""startFocus""&gt;
            &lt;result name=""success""&gt;/testPortlet1/testPortlet1.jsp&lt;/result&gt;
        &lt;/action&gt;
    &lt;/package&gt;

&lt;/struts&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>5) Now my problem is to understand how correctly configure the <strong>web.xml</strong> file (that I have into the folder **\Web\src\main\webapp\WEB-INF**). From what I understand in this file I have the mapping with the Struts 2 servlets (or am I wrong?)</p>

<p>So I have something like this (for another working servlet):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;servlet&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;calendar&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.liferay.portal.kernel.servlet.PortletServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
    &lt;init-param&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;portlet-class&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;org.apache.struts2.portlet.dispatcher.Jsr168Dispatcher&lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;/init-param&gt;
    &lt;load-on-startup&gt;0&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;

&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;calendar&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/calendar/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So the first section definied the servlet and the second section definied the URL pattern mapped to be handled by this servlet. Is it true or am I missing something?</p>

<p>So what have I to do to configure my previous ""Hello World test"" servlet? Is this ok?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;servlet&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;testPortlet1&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.liferay.portal.kernel.servlet.PortletServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
    &lt;init-param&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;portlet-class&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;org.apache.struts2.portlet.dispatcher.Jsr168Dispatcher&lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;/init-param&gt;
    &lt;load-on-startup&gt;0&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;

&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;testPortlet1&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/testPortlet1/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is this ok or am I missing something?</p>

<p>6) Then I have to configure the <strong>portlet.xml</strong> file into the folder **\Web\src\main\webapp\WEB-INF**, adding: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;portlet&gt;

        &lt;portlet-name&gt;testPortlet1&lt;/portlet-name&gt;
        &lt;display-name&gt;testPortlet1&lt;/display-name&gt;
        &lt;portlet-class&gt;org.apache.struts2.portlet.dispatcher.Jsr168Dispatcher&lt;/portlet-class&gt;

        &lt;init-param&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;viewNamespace&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;/testPortlet1&lt;/value&gt;
        &lt;/init-param&gt;

        &lt;init-param&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;defaultViewAction&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;!--&lt;value&gt;savePhoto&lt;/value&gt;--&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;startTestPortlet1&lt;/value&gt;
        &lt;/init-param&gt;

        &lt;expiration-cache&gt;0&lt;/expiration-cache&gt;

        &lt;supports&gt;
            &lt;mime-type&gt;text/html&lt;/mime-type&gt;
            &lt;portlet-mode&gt;VIEW&lt;/portlet-mode&gt;
        &lt;/supports&gt;

        &lt;portlet-info&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;testPortlet1&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/portlet-info&gt;

    &lt;/portlet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>where <strong>startTestPortlet1</strong> represent the method <strong>startTestPortlet1()</strong> definied in my action class.</p>

<p>7) Then i add this statment into the <strong>liferay-portlet.xml</strong> configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;portlet&gt;
    &lt;portlet-name&gt;testpPortlet1&lt;/portlet-name&gt;
    &lt;instanceable&gt;false&lt;/instanceable&gt;
&lt;/portlet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>8) Finally I configured the file <strong>liferay-display.cml</strong> to set the categories of my portlet, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE display PUBLIC
        ""-//Liferay//DTD Display 6.0.0//EN""
        ""http://www.liferay.com/dtd/liferay-display_6_0_0.dtd""&gt;

&lt;display&gt;

    &lt;category name=""First category""&gt;

        &lt;category name=""Second inner category""&gt;

            &lt;category name=""Third inner category""&gt;

                &lt;category name=""chat""&gt;
                    &lt;portlet id=""ChatNavigatorUser""/&gt;
                    &lt;portlet id=""ChatNavigator""/&gt;
                &lt;/category&gt;

                &lt;category name=""testcategory""&gt;
                    &lt;portlet id=""TestPortlet1""/&gt;
                    &lt;portlet id=""testPortlet1""/&gt;
                &lt;/category&gt;

              &lt;/category&gt;

        &lt;/category&gt;

    &lt;/category&gt;

&lt;/display&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when I try to add my portlet on the homepage of the portal I obtain this contet instead the expected Hello World output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>testPortlet1 is temporarily unavailable.</strong></p>

    public int Id { get; set;}
    public decimal Amount { get; set;}

04-01 17:40:41.254: V/into(28770): Setting empty text: 3
</code></pre>

<p>And all of the EditTexts have the correct text in them (""Setting empty text: #"")</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>I am adding a <code>TextChangedListener</code> to my <code>EditText</code> that I inflate and when the text is changed I update a <code>Map&lt;String, String&gt;</code> and put the uniqueId as the key and the comment text as the value.</p>

<p>The problem occurs when I rotate the phone after changing one of the comments. I save the comments <code>Map</code> inside of <code>onSaveInstanceState</code>:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
    super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
    outState.putSerializable(COMMENTS, (Serializable)comments);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and I then retrieve them inside of <code>onActivityCreated</code></p>

<pre><code>if(savedInstanceState != null) {
        Log.v(""into"",""Retrieving..."");
        comments = (Map&lt;String, String&gt;)savedInstanceState.getSerializable(COMMENTS);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also iterate through that <code>Map</code> and verify that there is one entry with the correct uniqueId and correct changed comment text.</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>Next I call <code>setupCommentViews()</code> again. This time the logs look right, but the <code>EditTexts</code> ALL have the same text as the final one (the last inflated one).</p>

<pre><code>04-01 17:42:49.664: V/into(28770): Setting empty text: 1
04-01 17:42:49.664: V/into(28770): Setting old text: Changed the second textview
04-01 17:42:49.674: V/into(28770): Setting empty text: 3
</code></pre>

<p>But all the <code>EditTexts</code> now say: ""Setting empty text: 3""</p>

<p>Using a <code>ListView</code> is NOT the solution I'm looking for as there are lots of bugs with <code>EditTexts</code> inside of <code>ListView</code> with <code>AdjustResize</code> <code>softInputMode</code> </p>

<p>-</p>

<p>Can anyone shed any light on what is going on here? </p>

<p>Next I train a model that uses lasso regularization using the lars function:</p>

<pre><code>m = lars(x,y,type = ""lasso"", normalize = FALSE, intercept = TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p>Now I would like to know what is the estimated model (<code>that I know to be: y = 0.5 + 3 * x[,1] + 0 * x[,2]</code>)</p>

<p>I am only interested in the coefficients obtained in the last step:</p>

<pre><code>cf = predict(m, x, s=1, mode = ""fraction"", type = ""coef"")$coef
cf
a b 
3 0
</code></pre>

<p>These are the coefficients that I expect, but I can't find a way to get the intercept (<code>0.5</code>) from <code>m</code>.</p>

<p>I have tried to check the code of <code>predict.lars</code>, where the fit is done as such:</p>

<pre><code>fit = drop(scale(newx, 
           object$meanx, FALSE) %*% t(newbetas)) + object$mu)
</code></pre>

<p>I can see that the variables are scaled, and that the mean of <code>y</code> (object$mu) is used, but I can't find an easy way to obtain the value of the intercept I am looking for. How can I get that?</p>

I have a toolbar with a button, when the button is pressed a popup should appear, mimicking an extension of the toolbar (like a menu), and this popup should show two columns of radio buttons (say 2x5) and a text box...
My main problem is that the toolbar is small in height, so the popup has to overflow the bounds of the window/client area..</p>

<p>I thought of two possible implementations:  </p>

<ul>
<li>by using a wxMenu, since a menu <em>can</em> be drawn outside the client area. I fear that the layout possibilities aren't flexible enough for my goal</li>
<li>by using a shaped frame. Pressing the button would re-shape the frame and draw the needed widgets as requested.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>



<p>I'm new to these kind of PHP programming so bear with me.</p>

<p>I want users to be able to post two dates, a startdate and a enddate and from these dates calculate the business dates (exclude Saturday and Sunday) and insert these to <code>MySQL</code></p>

<p>For example if I have this form...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action='update.php' method='post'&gt;
  &lt;input type='text' name='start_date'&gt;
  &lt;input type='text' name='end_date'&gt;
  &lt;input type='submit' name='submit'&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>update.php</strong></p>

<pre><code>if(isset($_POST['submit'])) {

   $start_date = $_POST['start_date']; //Let's say this is 2012-10-01
   $send_date = $_POST['end_date']; //Let's say this is 2012-10-10

}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I would like to loop through the dates and create a MySQL query that would run like this:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO tbl_dates (date_value) VALUES ('2012-10-01');
INSERT INTO tbl_dates (date_value) VALUES ('2012-10-02');
INSERT INTO tbl_dates (date_value) VALUES ('2012-10-03');
INSERT INTO tbl_dates (date_value) VALUES ('2012-10-04');
INSERT INTO tbl_dates (date_value) VALUES ('2012-10-05');
INSERT INTO tbl_dates (date_value) VALUES ('2012-10-08');
INSERT INTO tbl_dates (date_value) VALUES ('2012-10-09');
INSERT INTO tbl_dates (date_value) VALUES ('2012-10-10');
</code></pre>

<p>I know this is probably not a good solution but it's how I need it.</p>

<p>How do I create the loop?</p>

<p>I have my items being retrieved like so:</p>

<p>then i have the ajax code and the button:</p>

        $("".load_more"").click(function (){

            $.ajax({
                url: ""loadmore.php?lastid="" + (""&lt;?php echo $id; ?&gt;""),
                success: function(html){
                    if(html){
                        $("".main_page"").append(html);
                        $('.load_more').html('Load More');
                    }else{
                        $('.load_more').replaceWith('&lt;center&gt;No more posts to show.&lt;/center&gt;');
                    }
                }
            });
        });
    });
&lt;/script&gt;



    &lt;button class=""load_more""&gt;Load More&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And finally the loadmore.php file that is being called when the button is clicked:</p>

<pre><code>    $res17 = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM `posts` WHERE id &lt; '"".addslashes($_GET['lastid']).""' LIMIT 0, 25 LIMIT 10""); 
while($row17 = mysql_fetch_assoc($res17)){
            $id = $row17['id'];
            $user_id = $row17['user_id'];

<p>how do i call the correct id? i know that
  url: ""loadmore.php?lastid="" + (""""), is probably wrong but not sure how to fix it</p>

<p>I'd typically use a ThreadLocal for this.  However, since the thread initialization is handled by the Actor thread pool, it seems like the only place to initialize and subsequently clear the ThreadLocal would be in the actor's PartialFunction which receives incoming messages.</p>

<p>What I'm doing now is to create another method in my Actor, like this:</p>

<pre><code>override def aroundUpdates[T](fn: =&gt; T) : T = {
  clientCache.init {
    fn
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where the <code>init</code> method handles clearing the ThreadLocal in a finally block.  I don't like this approach because aroundUpdates only exists for the purpose of setting up the cache and it smells like a code smell.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do this?</p>

I am very new at this, and I have some very basic questions regarding to the way unit tests are compiled and used. I am using the Boost.Test library on Linux.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it common to compile a single large test program, containing all test suites, for all your units? How about splitting the tests into many smaller independent test programs?</p></li>
<li><p>How is linking handled (with <code>make</code>)? Every test program object must be linked with the object file(s) from my source program that contains whatever it is that's being tested. Is there a way to handle this automatically? To be more specific, is there anyway to write a <code>Makefile</code> so that <code>make</code> automatically determines what object files must be linked together to generate a certain unit test program?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: My code is organized in many .cpp/.h files, and is currently monolithic (no libraries). The unit tests are in a separate directory, usually in 1-to-1 relationship with the .cpp files from my source tree.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: Hoping that this will make my question less broad, here is an excerpt from the Makefile I am using:</p>

<pre><code>$(TSTDIR)%.$(TEST): $(OBJDIR)%.$(TEST).$(OBJEXT) $(OBJDIR)%.$(OBJEXT)
    @mkdir -p $(@D)
    @$(CXX) -o $@ $^ $(TSTLIBS)

$(OBJDIR)%.$(OBJEXT): $(SRCDIR)%.$(SRCEXT) $(DEPDIR)%.$(DEPEXT)
    @mkdir -p $(@D)
    @$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(INCLUDES) -o $@ $&lt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>$(TEST)</code> is just a marker I am using to differentiate between my unit tests and other files. Note that I am currently linking all test programs with the object file that bears the same name. However this will break if symbols from another object file are also needed.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong>: This is an example of what I am talking about in the above paragraph.</p>

<p>MyOtherClass.h:</p>

<pre><code>class MyOtherClass
{
public:
    int Foo();
}
</code></pre>

<p>MyOtherClass.cpp:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""MyOtherClass.h""

int MyOtherClass::Foo()
{
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>MyClass.h:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""MyOtherClass.h""

class MyClass
{
public:
    int Foo();

private:
    MyOtherClass moc_;
}
</code></pre>

<p>MyClass.cpp:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""MyClass.h""

int MyClass::Foo()
{
    return moc_.Foo();
}
</code></pre>

<p>TestMyClass.cpp would test if <code>MyClass::Foo</code> returns 0. Using my current Makefile, this will not compile, as the test program needs to be linked with both MyClass.o and MyOtherClass.o.</p>

If I look at the xml file that visual studio generates, no error has been generated. In fact it doesn't look like it has even tried to include the member as my original 'include' line is still in there (but with 'path' part appearing before the 'file' part).</p>

<p>ETA2: I had to fix the c# example in the aforementioned blog post to split the include-includes into a seperate xml file, otherwise a stockoverflow was generated on compilation.<br>
I can't get it to work for me however. I'm using VB and i've tested it in 2008 and 2010 - both are express editions. This means that either the syntax is different, or the functionality is not implemented in the VB versions of visual studio.  </p>

Type vehicleType = typeof(IVehicle);
Type dbType = typeof(IDb);
foreach (Type type in vehicleType.Assembly.GetTypes().Where(t =&gt; t.IsClass &amp;&amp; t.GetInterfaces().Contains(vehicleType)))

This part, as far as I understand, should show how <code>Response</code> and <code>ResponseBuilder</code> can be used to easily return a response in combination with <code>Entity&lt;T&gt;</code> for response content.</p>

<p>Now, the documentation states that several data types are by default supported (here: '<a href=""https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/representations.html#reps-and-types"" rel=""nofollow"">Representations and Java types</a>'). <code>String</code> prime among them, matching any media type.</p>

<p>Of all the variations I've tried, the following is the simplest:</p>

<pre><code>@POST
public Response post() {
    URI createdUri;
    try {
        createdUri = new URI(""http://test.lan"");
    } catch (final URISyntaxException e) {
        throw new WebApplicationException(e);
    }

    return Response.created(createdUri).entity(Entity.text(""someContent"")).build();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've always gotten the same error (full stacktrace below) on calling the request: 
<code>org.glassfish.jersey.message.internal.MessageBodyProviderNotFoundException: MessageBodyWriter not found for media type=text/plain, type=class javax.ws.rs.client.Entity, genericType=class javax.ws.rs.client.Entity.</code></p>

<p>I believe it's saying that a suitable provider wasn't found for this Entity generic-type. However, String should be supported OOTB?</p>

<p>I found that <code>StringMessageProvider</code> is probably the Jersey 1 implementation of this provider, and the closest related classes I found in my Jersey 2 libraries arer the classes in <code>org.glassfish.jersey.message.internal</code> in jersey-common. Among the many providers there is the <code>StringMessageProvider</code>, which appears to me like a potential intended provider for this.</p>

<p>I've looked up the issue, and while there's plenty of people who get this when incorrectly trying to use a custom Provider, I found nothing about the default OOTB providers not working..</p>

<p>I've checked my libs, and right now I have the following dependencies in my pom (among others):</p>

<ul>
<li>jersey-container-servlet-core</li>
<li>jersey-client</li>
<li>jersey-common</li>
<li>jersey-server</li>
</ul>

<p>I've looked online but this seems to be all I need, although I have not with certainty found the right provider classes for String and  JAXB/JSON in the jars.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>

<ul>
<li>Maven project</li>
<li>with tomcat servlet-api 6.0.29</li>
<li>Version 2.6 of all mentioned jersey libs</li>
<li>Eclipse kepler</li>
<li>Using tomcat6 maven plugin to run embedded tomcat (works fine so far)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fiddler request used to test</h2>

<pre><code>POST HTTP/1.1

<p>The model is similiar to the name, it represents all steps the algorithm made through the time by pushing a new ""layer"" on its stack which is a modified (hopfully simplified) problem made out of the old one, considering the partial solution evaluated by the algorithm.

If not, that would mean the only option left is to implement my own AccessTokenProvider (assuming I still use the built in OAuth server and self host)?</p>

<p>When i take out the WHEN username is SESSION usernamebox part out.. the query does input into my database only not in the field of a logged in user..</p>

<p>I tried to echo something if the query succeeded but it doesnt show anything either.. Which means the query cant be executed (i think). Cant figure out why though(its hard being a noob sometimes)</p>

<p>I have the coordinates of the pivot-point of the plane as well as the angles of rotation (in x, y and z axis), I have also calculated the equation of the plane in the form:</p>

"26085777","1","26086556","","2014-09-28 14:15:45","","0","173","<p>I wrote a small program in MATLAB to compute the Shapley value 
using the multi-linear extension of a TU game. However, I run 
into trouble with the Symbolic Math Toolbox of MATLAB. In 
the program I have to integrate a set of functions to get the 
Shapley value. However, inside a MATLAB program I cannot use 
the int() command </p>

<pre><code>Error using sym/subsindex (line 663) Ivalid indexing or function definition. When defining a function, ensure that the body of the function is a SYM object. When indexing, the input must be numeric, logical or ':'.

Error in ShapleyValueML (line 65)shv(jj)=int(dfy,0,1) 
</code></pre>

<p>as a consequence I have to use integral() instead. In this case, I 
need to transcribe the set of expressions into MATLAB function handle 
with matlabFunction(). However, on all Linux machines (MATLAB R2014a) on 
which I have access this command does not work (see the discussion below). 
As a workaround, the MATLAB program returns the set of functions 
into the current workspace, there the Shapley value can be computed 
using the int() command. </p>

<p>To make the discussion more concrete, let us consider this small 
MATLAB program first.</p>

<pre><code>function [shv,F,dfm]=ShapleyValueML(v)

N=length(v);
[~, n]=log2(N);
S=1:N;
int=0:-1:1-n; 
mat=(rem(floor(S(:)*pow2(int)),2)==1);
cmat=(rem(floor(S(:)*pow2(int)),2)==0);
x=sym('x',[1 n]);
mx=1-x;
y = sym('y');
vy=ones(1,n)*y;
F=0;
shv=zeros(1,n);
dfm=cell(1,n);

for ss=1:N
    pd1=x(mat(ss,:));
    pd2=mx(cmat(ss,:));
    pd=prod(pd1)*prod(pd2)*v(ss);
    F=pd+F;
end
F=expand(F);

 for jj=1:n
     dF=diff(F,x(jj));
     dfy=subs(dF,x,vy);
%% Does not work!! MATLAB bug??? 
%  mf=matlabFunction(dfy);
%  shv(jj)=integral(mf,0,1);
%%
%% The best would be to use:
%%
%   shv(jj)=int(dfy,0,1)
%% but it cannot be used inside a program.
 dfm{jj}=dfy;
 end

end
</code></pre>

<p>The commented parts are the parts that do not work inside 
the program, but are needed to compute the Shapley value 
with that program, which is its purpose. I tested this program 
up to 12 players, and I was able to successfully calculate the 
Shapley value by a two step procedure. Hence, the above program 
specifies correctly the considered problem. To get a better 
understanding of this two step procedure and of the functionality 
of the above program, let us focus on a three person game. 
The values of the coalitions are given by the following data array</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; v = [0,0,90,0,100,120,220];
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that coalitions are ordered in accordance with their unique 
integer representations. The game is defined, we can now evaluate 
the multi-linear extension and the set of partial derivatives with 
the above program, but not the Shapley value.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; [shv,F,dfm]=ShapleyValueML(v);
</code></pre>

<p>Integration of the set of partial derivatives runs over the diagonal 
of the unit-cube, but then we can set the variables from [x1,x2,x3] 
to [y,y,y], and integration runs from 0 to 1. </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; for k=1:3, shv(k)=int(dfm{k},0,1);end;
</code></pre>

<p>The solution of the integration is the Shapley value given by:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; shv

shv =

    65    75    80
</code></pre>

<p>Checking that this is indeed the Shapley value can be accomplished 
with a potential function approach implemented in </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; sh_v=ShapleyValue(v)

sh_v =

     65    75    80
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of integrating with int() one can also use integral(), 
but then the contents like </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; dfm{1}

ans =

    - 90*y^2 + 190*y
</code></pre>

<p>must be rewritten with matlabFunction() into a function handle. As I 
have mentioned above this does not work under Linux 
(MATLAB R2013a,R2013b,R2014a). To see this let us try to reproduce 
the example   </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; syms x y
&gt;&gt; r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2);
</code></pre>

<p>from the documentation at the URL: </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/symbolic/generate-matlab-functions.html?searchHighlight=matlabFunction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/symbolic/generate-matlab-functions.html?searchHighlight=matlabFunction</a></p>

<p>This should give</p>

<pre><code>ht = 
@(x,y)tanh(sqrt(x.^2+y.^2))
</code></pre>

<p>but I get </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; ht = matlabFunction(tanh(r))
   Cell contents reference from a non-cell array object.

   Error in vectorize (line 15)
    c = cells{i};

    r = mup2mat(c{1});

   Error in sym/matlabFunction (line 123)
   body = mup2matcell(funs);
</code></pre>

<p>Here comes now my question: Exists there an alternative procedure to 
get from</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; dfm{1}

ans =

  - 90*y^2 + 190*y
</code></pre>

<p>a function handle </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; df=@(y) (- 90.*y.^2 + 190.*y)

 df = 

    @(y)(-90.*y.^2+190.*y)
</code></pre>

<p>to integrate it by</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; integral(df,0,1)

ans =

   65
</code></pre>

<p>Or to put it differently. Is there an alternative method available to 
change multiplication * to element-wise multiplication .*, and the 
power operation ^ to element-wise power.^?   </p>

<p>Of course, any suggestions of improvement for the above MATLAB program 
are highly appreciated. </p>

Hibernate: insert into SchoolVideo (category, image_name, reviewed, school_id, video_name) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)</p>

<p>So, my rpcServiceImpl method executes right up to the session.save() method call.  The print statement directly after it doesn't print, so I know that's where everything dies.  Anyone have any idea how I can track this lack of db insert now.  </p>

<p>client.rb</p>

<p>So as you can see there is a drop down box on the form which contains all of the clients.</p>

<p>I have a junction table setup with both <code>job_id</code> and <code>client_id</code> as a integer value in them.
So I think its just a case of defining them in my controller under the new and create action like the error message suggests.</p>

<p>this is how i call it in a simple JS function:</p>

<pre><code>function showWindow(){
var win = new windowKandidaatInfo(id);
if(win){
    win.show();
}}

<pre><code>mysqliteConnection1 = new SQLiteConnection(""Data Source="" + Name1 + "";Journal Mode=Off;Cache Size=999999;Synchronous=Off;PRAGMA locking_mode=EXCLUSIVE;PRAGMA read_uncommitted=False;"");
mysqliteConnection2 = new SQLiteConnection(""Data Source="" + Name2 + "";Journal Mode=Off;Cache Size=999999;Read Only=True;Synchronous=Off;PRAGMA locking_mode=EXCLUSIVE;PRAGMA read_uncommitted=False;"");
mysqliteConnection3 = new SQLiteConnection(""Data Source="" + Name3 + "";Journal Mode=Off;Synchronous=Off;PRAGMA locking_mode=EXCLUSIVE;PRAGMA read_uncommitted=False;"");
</code></pre>

<p>If a database file is open, I close the connection like this: </p>

<pre><code>mysqliteConnection1.Close();
</code></pre>

<p>Next I unzip my zip file with Ionic (DotNetZip). Ionic successfully overwrites all three databases.
All works fine.</p>

<p>When I try with the latest SQLite.Interop.dll (version 1.0.94), I have a problem unzipping the zip file.
In the case of the third database, ""Name3"", When Ionic wants to overwrite the original file by the unzipped file, it throws an exception saying that the file is already in use by another process.</p>

<p>Has someone else had the same problem with the new SQLite ?</p>

Whenever I output anything on my jframe, the x coordinate matches the jframe perfectly (The farthest left x pixel is 0, farthest right x is the width of the frame itself), but the y doesn't. I used a mouse motion listener to figure out that all my y outputs start 22 pixels higher than the frame is. Example:</p>

<p>If I were to draw any rectangle, image, or whatever to the coordinates (0,0)... The very top of my image will be cut off by exactly 22 pixels. I'm no expert of java, and I think that no-one else has had this problem proves that, but there does seem to be no cases of this happening and I've tried 2 different IDE's on 2 different computer to see if it's my machine.</p>

Depending on their values, I need to put some elements into an JSON Array. To Produce a JSON String with correct syntax, I need to dynamically decide whether to put a comma behind (or in front) an object, since JSON doesn't allow trailing commas in arrays.</p>

<p>The XML files look somewhat like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;list&gt;
    &lt;type_a&gt;
        &lt;active&gt;0&lt;/active&gt;
        &lt;data_a&gt;don't put me to JSON...&lt;/data_a&gt;
    &lt;/type_a&gt;

        &lt;active&gt;1&lt;/active&gt;
        &lt;data_b&gt;put me to JSON&lt;/data_b&gt;
    &lt;/type_b&gt;
    &lt;type_c&gt;
        &lt;active&gt;1&lt;/active&gt;
        &lt;data_c&gt;me too...&lt;/data_c&gt;
    &lt;/type_c&gt;
&lt;/list&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The XSL to convert this looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:template match=""/list""&gt;
[
    &lt;xsl:if test=""type_a/active != 0""&gt;
      { ""type"": ""type_a"",
        ""data"": &lt;xsl:value-of select=""type_a/data_a"" /&gt; }
    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
    &lt;xsl:if test=""type_b/active != 0""&gt;
      { ""type"": ""type_b"",
        ""data"": &lt;xsl:value-of select=""type_b/data_b"" /&gt; }
    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;

    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
]
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

<p>The Problem is, that I need to put commas between the different <code>{ }</code> objects, but not after the last active one. The only two solutions I see are, either to check if any of the preceding objects where active, before putting an object (<code>&lt;xsl-if test=""type_a/active != 0 or type_b/active != 0""&gt;, &lt;/xsl-if&gt;</code>; in front of the third object) or to transfer the XML into some, less odd, intermediate XML first. Particular the first option would be extremely ugly, since in reality I have to check for far more than 3 object types. The XML Format is produced by some legacy application and can't be changed.</p>

<p>Should I expect any further trouble because of using XSL to transfer the XML Structure to some none XML output?</p>

When the application loads the detailsViewController pops a Modal viewController that contains a UINavigationBar.</p>

<p>The UINavigationBar has a search bar on it (set programatically). When focus is brought to the search bar the keyboard pops-up. </p>

<p>However, depending on the orientation of the device (simulator) the keyboard pops-up in the wrong orientation. The keyboard is always displayed as if the ipad is in a 'normal' orientation (i.e. at the side the home key is at)</p>

<p>I am returning <strong>YES</strong> in all of the shouldAutoRotate Methods:</p>

<pre><code>  - (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:
(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation;
</code></pre>

<p>To try and find out what was happening i added some debug code to each class to log the <code>interfaceOrientation</code> each time the shouldAutorotate event is fired while also showing when the modal <code>viewDidLoad</code> method fired. I did a test for each orientation: the debug output is shown below.</p>

<p><strong>The debug shows that regardless of the actual device orientation, the rootViewController and DetailsViewController interface orientations are always Portrait</strong>.</p>

<p>The only correct logs (where interface orientation = device orientation) are the first and last(3rd) time the modal shouldAutorotate events are fired in each test.</p>

<p>If I rotate the iPad after the app has launched then the keyboard appears in the correct orientation.</p>

<p>Can anyone shed some light on why this might be happening and how to avoid it?</p>

<p>The brute force way of doing this obviously would be to hook up pointer pressed events on every grid of every page and resetting the timer if any of these events is fired but I was wondering if there was a more elegant and more reliable way of doing this.</p>

The solution has to be done at the API definition layer ( API of FSDataInputStream) such that it works with all our existing ETL programs.  I looked into FSDataInputStream or ( <a href=""https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FSDataInputStream.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FSDataInputStream.html</a>)  and DistributedFileSystem ( <a href=""https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileSystem.html#open(org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileSystem.html#open(org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path)</a> . </p>

<p>One possibility is to read the stream from FSDataInputStream and sanitize the stream by removing the SSN and then create an new FSDataInputStream and provide this new FSDataInputStream back to the client. All this would be done in open method of FileSystem implementation( for DistributedFileSystem) of HDFS. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am having issues with converting an InputStream back to FSDataInputStream as FSDataInputStream does not accept an InputStream which is not instance of Seekable or PositionReadable.</p>

<p>"" if( !(in instanceof Seekable) || !(in instanceof PositionedReadable) ) {

All this used to work in turbo C++
I couldnt figure out a way to do this in visual studio.
Maybe i am missing some setting because, to even create a c project i had to do a lot of things,

<p>Traditionally, discussions about processes-vs-threads revolve around differences between scheduling, cost of context switches, or cost of sharing resources.</p>

<p>However, I have never learned about, or heard of, a notion that one is necessarily better than another for CPU-intensive tasks versus IO. If there is essentially a 1-1 relationship between a process and a thread (not always something you can assume), does it even matter, from a CPU-vs-IO perspective, which one to use?</p>

<p>The standard pthread documentation does not shed light on this particular claim; does someone know a better source?</p>

<p>Now, we want to analyze crash dump (mini dump) file of an application that is using our library. 
Since we didn't store the pdb file, I created a new one using the same source code (using the same tag in SVN). Then I tried WinDbg and provided the pdb file, but the debugger didn't like it.</p>

<p>Since the source code is the same, I think the only difference is the date the build was done (We are using the same machine for releases). Can this really cause the debugger to not load the symbol file? How does WinDbg identify a symbol file?</p>

<p>If I am sure that the symbol file is identical to the original one (except the date), is there a way to force WinDbg to load the symbol file?</p>

I do not want to include the codes in feature files as it reduces the readability.

1) Setting alpha parameter. However, this makes the marker edge transparent too, which is not the desired effect.

<p>Now I need to filter the second drop down based on the selected value in first drop down. I can't use the PHP code which uses the DB callback methods. in my script I have something like this.</p>

<pre><code>   $(""#Group"").change(function() {
     var groupVal = $(this).find(""option:selected"").val();
     $('#subGroup option').filter(function( {return!$(this).val().indexOf(groupVal)!=-1);}).remove();
    });
</code></pre>

<p>the script is working fine, it removes all the options other then the one selected. but my problem is that next time when i select other value in first drop down, second drop down goes empty. I even worked with hide/show but guess they wont work with <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> :( </p>

<p>is there any way by which I can repopulate the second drop down when I selected some other option in first drop down?</p>

It took me a while to figure out I need Redis installed (btw, if you're making a boilerplate either include all required software with it or warn about the requirement for certain software - Redis was never mentioned as required) and to get my way around the server.js file.</p>

<p>Right now I'm still a stranger to how I could build a site in this..</p>

<p>There is one problem that bugs me specifically - when I run the server.js file, it says it's all good. When I try to access it in the browser, it says 'transferring data from localhost' and never ends - it's like render doesn't finish sending and never sends the headers. No errors, no logs, no nothing - res.render('index') just hangs. The file exists, and the script finds it, but nothing ever happens. I don't have a callback in the render defined, so headers should get sent as usual.
If on the other hand I replace the render command with a simple write('Hello world'); and then do a res.end();, it works like a charm.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong with rendering? I haven't changed a thing from the original installation btw. The file in question is index.ejs, it's in views/, and I even called app.register('.ejs', require('ejs')); just in case before the render itself. EJS is installed.</p>

<p>Also worth noting - if I do a res.render('index'); and then res.write('Hello'); immediately afterwards, followed by res.end();, I do get ""Hello"" on the screen, but the render never happens - it just hangs and says ""Transferring data from localhost"". So the application doesn't really die or hang, it just never finishes the render.</p>

<p>Edit: Interesting turn of events: if I define a callback in the render, the response does end. There is no more ""Transferring data..."", but the view is never rendered, neither is the layout. The source is completely empty upon inspection. There are no errors whatsoever, and no exceptions.</p>

<p>I have a form that I am modifying from an existing form my company has. This form has a jquery that picks up the next availible claim number and submits it to my mysql database when the form is sumbitted. </p>

<p>I am trying to change this form to make it for purchase orders. The jquery function gets called anytime that the store selected changes (there is a list of 22 sites in a drop down box and it uses onchange='getClaimNumber()' ) so im assuming that number is picked up right at the beginning. </p>

<p>How can i make the form show this number once the store is chosen? Idealy the form should be able to be printed off showing the number and then submitted. I am happy to even have a button that calls the query and makes it display if I have to. </p>

<p>General Setup: I'm using a ScrollView with PageControl inside a TabBarApplication</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it possible to have the PageControl within the same area as the content of the pages? For me it always gets hidden by the SrollView's Views, but due to display space being rare I really need it on the same height as the actual content.</p></li>
<li><p>I've fooled around in some Sandbox-Project and whenever I first started to implement a button into the View of a ScrollView-Page the Pages of the ScrollView wouldn't show immediately anymore, but only after the first scroll attempt. I'd post some code about that but its basically only autogenerated from IB.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a general Question about possibilities again: The main design of the Project should be a TabBarApplication with a NavigationController letting you go deeper into sub-menues like it is pretty common. Now in one of the Tabs there should be the PageControl, in which you can then again go into sub-menues by pushing Views on a NavigationController stack . Is this possible?</p></li>

<p>And finally the JSF managed bean:</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>At the end, I want to be able to use the same application scoped service instances in the REST resource classes as well as in the JSF beans, but I can't get CDI and JAX-RS work together.</strong></p>

<p>The JSF/CDI part works fine, but the injection into the REST resource classes does not really work. I read some articles, where they showed two different approaches to combine CDI and JAX-RS: The first one is to annotate the REST resource class with <code>@ManagedBean</code> in order for the class to be instantiated by the CDI container and to be managed by the JAX-RS container:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>@ManagedBean
@Path(""/person"")
public class PersonController
{
    @Inject
    private PersonService personService;
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>The second approach is to give the class a CDI scope, e.g. <code>@RequestScoped</code> in order for the class to be instantiated and managed by the CDI container.</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>@Path(""/person"")
@RequestScoped
public class PersonController
{
    @Inject
    private PersonService personService;
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>None of the approaches work for me. I always end up with the following exception:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>org.glassfish.hk2.api.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: There was no object available for injection at Injectee(requiredType=PersonService,parent=PersonController,qualifiers={}),position=-1,optional=false,self=false,unqualified=null,5643079)

    at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.inject.Injections.getOrCreate(Injections.java:172)
</code></pre>

<p>But this error disappears when changing the injection binding configuration to:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>bind(PersonServiceImpl.class).to(PersonService.class);
</code></pre>

<p>Now injection somehow works, but for every REST request I get a new instance of the <code>PersonServiceImpl</code> injected, even if this service is application scoped. To me this is an indicator, that the JAX-RS component is totally separated from the CDI stuff and lives in a completely different environment or container as the CDI / JSF stuff does.</p>

<p>So I really wonder how to make these two concepts work together in a pure servlet 3.0 container.</p>

The php outputs HTML that uses jQuery to initialize a button.  When I click that button, a jquery dialog appears.  The  contents of the dialog are created from an object in PHP. and passed from a php object, but require formatting in Javascript, which is also passed from the php object.</p>

<p>A simplified version of the code would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$obj = new Custom_Object();
echo &lt;&lt;&lt;EOD
    &lt;input type=""button"" id=""button1""&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        $(""#button1"")
            .button()
            .click(function(){
                var dialog = $(""&lt;div&gt;"" + {$obj-&gt;print()} + ""&lt;/div&gt;"");
                dialog.dialog();});
    &lt;/script&gt;
EOD;
</code></pre>

<p>with $obj->print() looking something like:</p>

<pre><code>$return = ""&lt;p&gt;Some HTML&lt;/p&gt;"";
$return .= ""&lt;script&gt;Some Javascript to format the 'Some HTML' paragraph&lt;/script&gt;"";
return str_replace(array(""\r"", ""\n""), '', $return);
</code></pre>

<p>My questions: (1) Is there some obviously better way of writing this code that just isn't occurring to me; and (2) how does the browser deal with the fact that there are two sets of \script\ tags nested inside of each other? (For some reason the code doesn't work and I am guessing that this is what is causing it, but I am not sure).</p>

<p>I have used several articles on here to get me as far as I am, but I keep running into a <code>FileNotFoundException</code> as described in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4749415/unable-to-load-executing-assembly-into-new-appdomain-filenotfoundexception"">Unable to load executing assembly into new AppDomain, FileNotFoundException</a>.  My problem is that solution doesn't work.  The assembly I am trying to execute exists in a different location.  So <code>ApplicationBase</code> needs to be the folder of the assembly I am trying to execute.</p>

<pre><code>var otherType = typeof(BootstrapProxy);
var domaininfo = new AppDomainSetup

<p>The last line throws the exception and the AssemblyResolve event never fires off (as determined by placing a breakpoint on the <code>var lookupPath</code> line.</p>

<p>I have also tried the <code>AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve</code> event with the same handler as above with no luck.  I have also tried creating the same handler inside the <code>BootstrapProxy</code> class.</p>

<p>I think I am doing this properly but make note of the first paragraph, so if I'm completely off base, I'm not averse to doing things a different way.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I have changed the code around to forcibly load the assemblies into the new appdomain and still have issues.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2:</p>

<p>I Changed it around to this: </p>

<pre><code>var deps = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetReferencedAssemblies();
foreach (var dep in deps)
{
    var lookupPath = Path.GetDirectoryName(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location);
    if (lookupPath == null) continue;
    var assemblyname = new AssemblyName(dep.Name).Name;
    var assemblyFileName = Path.Combine(lookupPath, assemblyname + "".dll"");
    if (File.Exists(assemblyFileName))
        File.Copy(assemblyFileName, Path.Combine(_root, assemblyname + "".dll""));
}

File.Copy(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location, Path.Combine(_root, Path.GetFileName(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location)));
var otherType = typeof(BootstrapProxy);
var domaininfo = new AppDomainSetup
    {
        ConfigurationFile = executingAssembly + "".config"",
        ApplicationBase = _root
    };
Evidence adevidence = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.Evidence;
_domain = AppDomain.CreateDomain(_type.ToString(), adevidence, domaininfo);
var proxy = _domain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap(otherType.Assembly.FullName, otherType.FullName) as BootstrapProxy;
if (proxy != null)
{
    proxy.Main();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This method of copying the assembly and its references to the ApplicationBase of the new AppDomain is not ideal, as there are a few common references and I could end up with version conflicts and other issues.</p>

<p>One question; Is it possible to have more than one <code>&lt;application&gt;</code> tag in the manifest xml?</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;

  android:versionName=""1.0""&gt;
&lt;uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=""8"" /&gt;

&lt;application android:icon=""@drawable/icon"" android:label=""@string/app_name""&gt;
    &lt;activity android:name="".MainActivity""
              android:label=""@string/app_name""&gt;
        &lt;intent-filter&gt;

   android:label=""@string/app_name2""&gt;&lt;/application&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>I've been researching, but found only a vague post about creating a new manifest file for a new application. The MyApp application is just an app for a ""global variable"", since I guess there's no way to do that without a new application.</p>

<p>Here is the code for MyApp in case it helps:</p>

<pre><code>import android.app.Application;

public class MyApp extends Application{

public static int resultCount;

public int getCount(){
    return resultCount;
  }
public void setCount(int c){
    resultCount = c;
}
}

<p>On hover I want to change the border colour to what's been chosen for that category by the user from the database.</p>

<p>here is the markup</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class=""productRange""&gt;

    {foreach $productRange index range}

        &lt;li style=""border-top: 1px solid {$range.productsCategoryColour}""&gt;
            &lt;span class=""productRangeTitle""style=""color{$range.productsCategoryColour}""&gt;{$range.itemTitle}&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;ul class=""productCategoryView""&gt;

             {foreach $range.products ind product}

             &lt;li class=""productCategoryNugget""&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;       

    {/foreach}

&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>CSS...</p>

<pre><code> .productCategoryNugget:hover {
      border: 1px solid;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>the category colour is stored in $range.productsCategoryColour which sets the border-top of the containing li fine. It's the li's inside the ul productCategoryView which have a border appear on hover, right now it's black on them all, fine, but I'd like it to match the colour of the category they are in</p>

<p>I need to display the table values as per the segment selections. And also if any of the row of the table is selected, it has to move to a newer ViewController with the detailed view.</p>

<p>I pass the data to the newViewController as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a class named newClass which contains all the elements I want to pass across.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a NSMutableArray ""newObjects"" in the firstViewController. </p></li>

<li><p>In the <code>- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath</code> method, this is the code</p>

<p>obj = [newObjects objectAtIndex:path.row];</p>

<p>NSLog(@""Row selected is %ld"", (long)path.row); //this returns the correct row selected</p>

Most files are about 300-400&nbsp;KB which is fine loading. But when they go beyond 100&nbsp;MB the process has a hard time (as you'd expect).</p>

<p>What happens is that the file is read and shoved into a RichTextBox which is then navigated - don't worry too much about this part.</p>

<p>The developer who wrote the initial code is simply using a StreamReader and doing</p>

<pre><code>[Reader].ReadToEnd()
</code></pre>

<p>which could take quite a while to complete.</p>

<p>My task is to break this bit of code up, read it in chunks into a buffer and show a progressbar with an option to cancel it.</p>

<p>Some assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most files will be 30-40&nbsp;MB</li>
<li>The contents of the file is text (not binary), some are Unix format, some are DOS.</li>
<li>Once the contents is retrieved we work out what terminator is used.</li>
<li>No-one's concerned once it's loaded the time it takes to render in the richtextbox. It's just the initial load of the text.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now for the questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I simply use StreamReader, then check the Length property (so ProgressMax) and issue a Read for a set buffer size and iterate through in a while loop <em>WHILST</em> inside a background worker, so it doesn't block the main UI thread? Then return the stringbuilder to the main thread once it's completed.</li>
<li>The contents will be going to a StringBuilder. can I initialise the StringBuilder with the size of the stream if the length is available?</li>
</ul>

<p>Are these (in your professional opinions) good ideas? I've had a few issues in the past with reading content from Streams, because it will always miss the last few bytes or something, but I'll ask another question if this is the case.</p>

Conceptually, it makes sense... I think? From what I've read, a Generic can't be serialized unless it has been explicitly defined.</p>

<p>So I'd like to provide my example; in which I can't get to work at all. Which means; I'm sure there are others who experience some difficulty as well. When you assist if you could provide the code; that would work and explain it.  That way I can fully understand the issue.  Which will assist me on well, understanding the Windows Communication Foundation.</p>

<p>The goal is a client application which simply has five fields; in which it 'Post' to the server.</p>

<ul>
<li>First Name</li>
<li>Last Name</li>
<li>Email Address</li>
<li>Phone Number</li>
<li>Site Address</li>
</ul>

<p>Which isn't too complicated.</p>

<p>Here is what I've done, which in my quest to learn WCF I've included as close to OOP Principals as I can for a SOA based application.  That way it provides code re-useability.</p>

<p>Model / Data Contract:</p>

<pre><code>#region Using Reference...

using System.Runtime.Serialization;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Text;
using System.Linq;
using System;

#endregion

namespace _2Do.Model.Customer
{

    [DataContract(IsReference = true)]
    public class Person
    {

        #region Declared Variable.

        string first;
        string last;
        string email;
        string phone;
        string site;

        #endregion

        #region Constructor:

        Person()
        {

            // Empty Constructor.

        }

        #endregion

        #region Data Member Properties:

        [DataMember()]
        public string First
        {

            get { return first; }
            set { first = value; }

        }

        [DataMember()]
        public string Last
        {

            get { return last; }
            set { last = value; }

        }

        [DataMember()]
        public string Email
        {

            get { return email; }
            set { email = value; }

        }

        [DataMember()]
        public string Phone
        {

            get { return phone; }
            set { phone = value; }

        }

        [DataMember()]
        public string Site
        {

            get { return site; }
            set { site = value; }

        }

        #endregion

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>So that is the object in which should be exposed through the Metadata for the client; so for the Service interface I attempted this:</p>

<pre><code>#region Using Reference...

using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.ServiceModel;
using _2Do.Model.Customer;
using System.Text;
using System.Linq;
using System;

#endregion

namespace _2Do.Contract.Customer
{

    [ServiceContract (Namespace = ""https://_2Do"") ]
    public interface IPerson
    {

        [OperationContract()]
        Person SetCustomer(Dictionary&lt;Guid, Person&gt; info);

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>So the above is the goal; to transfer my Person object; stored into a Dictionary.  The other thing to note; is I thought the implementation of passing the values by reference would assist in the serialization.  I figured once the data is stored in memory; it would contain an explicit methodology for it to handle.  Is that wrong on my part?</p>

<p>So that is my <code>DataContract</code> and <code>ServiceContract</code>.</p>

<p>The implementation at this point is like this:</p>

<pre><code>#region Using Reference...

using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using _2Do.Contract.Customer;
using System.ServiceModel;
using _2Do.Model.Customer;
using System.Text;
using System.Linq;
using System;

#endregion

namespace _2Do.Service.Customer
{

    [ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.PerCall)]
    public class PersonService : IPerson
    {

        #region Constructor:

        PersonService()
        {

            // Empty Constructor.

        }

        #endregion

        #region Implement Interface:

        Person SetCustomer(Dictionary&lt;Guid, Person&gt; info)
        {

            // Receive an error that indicates; best overload method.
            // Contains invalid arguments.

        }

        #endregion

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I created a separate project to host the application; which I created an empty text file and renamed it to <code>PersonService.svc</code>. </p>

<p>Which then I put: <code>&lt;%@ ServiceHost Service = ""_2Do.Service.Customer.PersonService"" %&gt;</code>. </p>

<p>Which should point to the proper namespace; which In the <code>PersonService</code> I have a <code>web.config</code> file that contains the bare minimum configuration to host in Internet Information System.  Which I thought would allow me to circumvent defining my Address, Binding, and Contract. As IIS will do it all for me now.</p>

<p>Then I've created a <code>ClientProxy</code> class; which contains a mirror almost of the <code>DataContract</code>. Then I've created the actual client application to do:</p>

<pre><code>PersonProxy p = new PersonProxy();
p.First = txtFirst.Text;
p.Last = txtLast.Text;
p.Email = txtEmail.Text;
p.Phone = txtPhone.Text;
p.Site = txtSite.Text;
Dictionary&lt;Guid, Person&gt; i = new Dictionary&lt;Guid, Person&gt;();
i.Add(Guid.NewGuid(), p);
</code></pre>

<p>I've got these projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Model --> DataContract</li>
<li>Contract --> ServiceContract</li>
<li>Service --> Implementation for Interfaces</li>
<li>Host --> Stores Service / Svc</li>
<li>ClientProxy --> Implementation for Interface</li>
<li>Client --> Linked to actual values for ClientProxy to inherit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which is how I consume it on the Client.  I'm not sure where I've messed up this.  I'd really like to understand WCF as I need to learn it for a work project.  But I'm so frustrated and feel so stupid as I can't seem to solve this issue.</p>

<p>If I follow tutorials, it works.  But once I go back to my original implementation it fails.  Not sure what or where I'm going wrong.  Some hand holding would be appreciated; but if you could explain it step by step it'd be so appreciated. So I can learn from my mistakes to actually improve.</p>

<p>I can't get it to store the variable on the server, transmit, and I have no clue why at this point.</p>

<pre><code>if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {// code for IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari

<p>I've done some testing and I think the problem is with the last part of the code. If I place the <code>console.log(xmlhttp.status)</code> before the <code>if</code> statement, it returns <code>0</code> (firebug at the end of the request returns <code>200</code>), while if I place  it inside the <code>if</code> nothing shows up in the console. So my best guess is that the problem is that the <code>if</code> statement runs before the actual request is done an so it returns <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>However, the behavior appears to be different with list operations like pop, append etc. This somewhat confuses me. Do all list operations operate globally ? If so, is there any particular reason behind it ?</p>

    popped = stuff.pop(0)
    print ""function: '%s' was popped!"" % popped

words = [""A"", ""list"", ""of"", ""words""]
print ""Before:"", words
pop_first(words)
print ""After:"", words

<p>Output :</p>

function: 'A' was popped!

<p>Now what I want to do is to decode these AVPackets using avcodec_decode_video2. I think the problem is that I haven't initialized properly the decoder because to encode I used  ""ultrafast"" profile and ""zerolatency"" tune ( x264 ) and to decode I don't know how to specify to ffmpeg these options.
In some examples I have read people initialize the decoder using the file where the video is stored, but in this case I have directly the AVPackets.
What I'm doing to try to decode is:</p>

<pre><code>avcodec_init();  
avcodec_register_all();  
AVCodec* pCodec;  
pCodec=avcodec_find_decoder(CODEC_ID_H264);  
AVCodecContext* pCodecContext;  
pCodecContext=avcodec_alloc_context();  
avcodec_open(pCodecContext,pCodec);  
pCodecContext-&gt;width = 320;
pCodecContext-&gt;height = 200;
pCodecContext-&gt;extradata = NULL;
unsigned int nNumPackets = packets.size();
int frameFinished = 0;
for ( auto it = packets.begin(); it != packets.end(); it++ )
{
    AVFrame* pFrame;
    pFrame = avcodec_alloc_frame();
    AVPacket* pPacket = *it;
    int iReturn = avcodec_decode_video2( pCodecContext, pFrame, &amp;frameFinished, pPacket );
}

<p>But in iReturn always is -1.</p>

<p>Serializing process seems to works well but when I try to deserialize the file I have the following error: ""Unexpected end of file.""</p>

<p>I suspect the problem to be linked to the encoding of the file. When I don't crypt data and only use <code>DataContractSerializer</code> I have an UTF8 file whereas otherwise I have an ANSI file. Can someone help me to figure out where is my problem and how to solve it?</p>

<p>The high-level ease of use of .NET is the reason I use it.  I've written C and real (hardware processor) assembly in environments with limited resources.  That was the reason to spend the effort on so many meticulous details, for efficiency.  Up in .NET land, it kind of defeats the purpose of having a high-level object-oriented language if you waste time diving down into the most cryptic details of the implementation.  In the course of working with .NET, I have debugged the usual performance issues an odd race conditions, and I've done it all by reading my own source code, never once having any thought as to what intermediate language the compiler is generating.  For example, it's pretty obvious that a for(;;) loop is going to be faster than a foreach() on an array, considering that foreach() is going to use an enumeration <em>object</em> with a method call to advance to each next time instead of a simple increment of a variable, and this is easy to prove with a tight loop run a few million times (no disassembly required).</p>

<p>What really makes disassembling IL silly is the fact that's it's not <em>real</em> machine code.  It's virtual machine code.  I've heard some people actually like to move instructions around to optimize it.  Are you kidding me?  Just-in-time compiled virtual machine code can't even do a simple tight for(;;) loop at the speed of natively compiled code.  If you want to squeeze every last cycle out of your processor, then use C/C++ and spend time learning real assembly.  That way the time you spend understanding lots of low-level details will actually be worthwhile.</p>

<p>So, other than having too much time on their hands, why do people disassemble .NET (CLR) binaries?</p>

<p>For example: I was just using boost.asio, trying out the tutorials. I found in the doc that I had to link to boost_system and regex, but for some reason I also had to add pthread for it to work ... I have installed boost with 'apt-get install', thinking all I would have to link to was boost. Wrong apparently ...</p>

<p>It seems I really can't understand how to develop on linux. How can you know when you need to add a library? In the example I gave, boost depends on pthread, so I have to link it. Why don't I have to link to any other stuff boost depends on? Or suppose pthread depends on something, why don't I have to link that (eg. why don't you have to link to standard C libs)? How can you know how g++ is configured? And how can you change it?</p>

<p>I guess my main question is: Is there any logic to configuring a build on linux? (useful references are always welcome also)</p>

<pre><code>plot &lt;- ggplot(figdata, aes(y=Counts, x=category, col=strain)) +

<p>EDIT: Incorporating jitter will allow the all the data to fit, but I don't want to add noise to this data and would prefer to show it as discreet data.
adjusting the binwidth and dotsize to 0.3 as suggested below also fits all the data, however it leaves too much white space.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zQVeF.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zQVeF.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I think that I might have to transform my data so that the values are steps smaller than 1, in order to get everything to fit horizontally and dot sizes to big large enough to reduce white space.</p>

<p>One point is, I would like to see all private member variables to be declared first and then the getter/setter methods follow.</p>

<p>Both RSA and Eclipse are very powerful tools why I hope that someone of you knows a way to change or specify the Source Code Layout/Format.</p>

  )
    //.ExposeConfiguration(CreateSchema)
  .ExposeConfiguration(UpdateSchema)
  .BuildConfiguration();

<p>The CreateSchema method looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>private static void CreateSchema(Configuration cfg)
{
    var schemaExport = new SchemaExport(cfg);
    schemaExport.Execute(false, true, true);
    schemaExport.Drop(false, true);
    schemaExport.Create(false, true);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the UpdateSchema like this:</p>

<pre><code>private static void UpdateSchema(Configuration cfg)
{
    var schemaUpdate = new SchemaUpdate(cfg);
    schemaUpdate.Execute(false, true);
    var ex = schemaUpdate.Exceptions;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now CreateSchema works OK - tables are being created properly. The problem is with UpdateSchema, which is not working. So far I was able to diagnose what's wrong by checking the schemaUpdate.Exceptions, which contains 2 entries, both with the same exception :</p>

<pre><code>[System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException] = {""Invalid object name 'sys.sequences'.""}
</code></pre>

<p>From what I've read, sys.sequences is a new feature in SQL Server 2012, but I don't know how this table (is this a system table?) should be created (shouldn't it be created when creating the database?). Could this be a problem of version conflict of something? I'm using SQL Server 2012 Express, .NET Framework 4.5, NHibernate 3.3.1.4 and FluentNHibernate 1.3</p>

<p>---------------------- <strong>EDIT</strong> -------------------------
<br />
Ok my mistake, I was actually connected to 2008 version os SQL Server, that's why sys.sequences (now I also know it is a system view) was not available. Still, I would want SchemaUpdate to work on 2008, is it possible?</p>

}

<p>At first I though it was because I missed closing a stream, but they are all closed. What could be the problem? Is there any other solution to storing objects. Originally I had it so that it stored each Contact in the same file, but then I transferred it to storing the ArrayList of contacts.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Info</p>

<ul>
<li>The first two tables have fixed 50 records. These tables are populated first time when the database is configured for a client.</li>
<li>For the first two table IDs is mapping column(primary-forign key).</li>
<li>The last two tables CtType_id is mapped to Id column of CTType table</li>
</ul>

<p>From the UI when the user saves a new CTTypeMapObject it inserts record into CTTypeMap table. The mapping is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>public class CTTypeMapMap :Enity&lt;CTTypeMap&gt;
{
    Public CTTypeMapMap()
    {
        Id(x =&gt; x.ID);

            join.Map(x =&gt; x.CTTypeMap).Column(""CT_Type_id"");  //not working
        });
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The value for the column <strong>CT_Type_id</strong> of table <strong>CTTypeMap_Legacy</strong> should be <strong>CTType_Legacy_id</strong> column value of <strong>CTType_Legacy</strong>. I am not able to insert the correct value into <strong>CT_Type_id</strong> of table <strong>CTTypeMap_Legacy</strong>.</p>

<p>Could someone please let me know how to do the mapping on the line highlighted with the comment?</p>

<p>At present I got two tables display result from two queries from a single table. I want to mix these result in a single table ?</p>

<p>That is my new table must have three columns. First with common value from both tabels and second column from first table second column and third column from second table second column. Second and third column in new table is dispalying data from same column from the main mysql data.</p>

<p>I recently came accross the <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/macwidgets/"" rel=""nofollow"">mac_widgets api for java</a>. I went through the docementation and exaples but i didn't find a way to add widgets to the HudWindow. I came accross an online solution</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>panel.setLayout(new BoxLayout?(panel, BoxLayout?.Y_AXIS));
  panel.add(sourceList.getComponent());</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This works if panel is a reference to a JPanel object and it is add to a JFrame window.</p>

<p>Is there a way i can add panel to the HudWindow in the mac_widgets api?</p>

<p>In the load function I parse the pre-read json data so i just have to add another 20 one to the list and <code>notifyDataSetChanged()</code>.. The function works well but it has a side effect:  about 50% of the time the click on items is not recognized. I scroll down, receive the next 20 but I cannot click on any items. But for example if I change activity and come back to the listview, it works. Why?

<p>and then use:</p>

<pre><code>$hash_ref_2-&gt;{e}.

<p>So in summary I want to store hash reference till a point ""x"" in the hierarchy  in a variable and then access the reference which the point ""x"" points to. I think this is more clear in the example above.</p>

<p>More details</p>

<p>I tried couple of things but doesnt seem to work for me. I am copying the code but not all the things I tried to copy hash. Also the output I am getting is something like this</p>

          'e' =&gt; {
                   'count' =&gt; 2

                 },
          'd' =&gt; {
                   'count' =&gt; 2
                 }
        };
</code></pre>

<p>where I would expect something like this:</p>

<pre><code>'a' =&gt; { 'count' =&gt; 2, 'b' =&gt; { 'count' =&gt; 2, 'c' =&gt; ......} }  
</code></pre>

<p>Here's some code I used:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use Data::Dumper;

my @array1 = ('a','b','c','d','e');
my @array2 = ('a','b','c','d','e');
my $hash;

 build_hash(\@array1);
 build_hash(\@array2);


sub build_hash {

    my @array = @{shift @_};

    my $hash_ref;

    for ( my $i =0 ;  $i &lt; scalar @array ; $i++ ){

        print ""$i \t $array[$i] \n"";
         if ( exists $hash-&gt;{$array[$i]} ){

            $hash-&gt;{$array[$i]}-&gt;{'count'}++;
        }

        }
    }
    print Dumper($hash);

<p>I'd like to get to this:</p>

<pre><code>id  income_transactions expense_transactions    income_amount   expense_amount

"5507738","1","","","2011-03-31 23:47:53","","3","786","<p>I am working on a enhancement for an existing Java application. The application is a message processor which processes several millions of messages daily. It basically written using Core Java with threads and queues are implemented using Collection classes.</p>

<p>In this application some type of the messages are running in a single thread. I was given the task to make this particular part of the application to multi threaded to process the messages faster, as we have dual processors.  </p>

<p>Since we are using Java 5, I took the approach of using ThreadPoolExcecutor. I have created processor threads for each clients so that message for a particular threads can be processed in its own thread. The processor threads are implementing Callable interface as this will allow me to check the future object whether the previous task is finished or not.</p>

<p>During initialization process, I will go over all the clients and create processor threads for each and store it in map using their id as unique key. To track previously submitted job, I do keep the future object in another map again using same id as unique key.</p>

<p>Below are some snippet of code which I used : In main class - </p>

<pre><code>ThreadPoolExecutor  threadPool = null;
int poolSize = 20;
int maxPoolSize = 50;
long keepAliveTime = 10;
final ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;Runnable&gt; queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;Runnable&gt;(1000);
threadPool = new ThreadPoolExecutor(poolSize, maxPoolSize,keepAliveTime, TimeUnit.SECONDS, queue);

   ....
   ....
 for (each client...) {
   id = getId()..
   future = futuremap.get(id);
   if(!future.isDone())
      continue;
   if(future == null || future.isDone()) {
      processor = processormap.get(id);
      if(processor == null) {
         processor = new Processor(.....);
         //add to the map
         processormap.put(id,processor);
      }
      //submit the processor
      future = threadPool.submit(processor );
      futuremap.put(id,future);
 }
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Processor Thread</p>

<pre><code>public class MyProcessor implements Callable&lt;String&gt; {
        .....
        .....
    public String call() {
        ....
        ....
    }
 }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The Issue</strong> </p>

<p>The above implementation is working good in my test environment. However, in production environment (<strong>Edit#1</strong> - <strike>Ubuntu</strike>, Linux Slackware, Java - 1.6.0_18), we observed that other threads of the application which are not managed through this new ThreadpoolExecutor are getting affected. i.e., their tasks are getting delayed for hours. Is it because the threads created by ThreadPoolExecutors are taking the whole resources or whatsoever and not giving the chance to other threads. </p>

<p>The new threads created using ThreadPoolExceutor are doing independent task and are not in contention with other thread for resources. i.e., there is no race condition scenario. </p>

<p>In the log, for the new Threads, I can see that there are maximum of 20 threads running (corepoolsize) and there are no rejection exceptions, i.e., the number of submits are within the bounds of the queue. </p>

<p>Any ideas why this is happening? </p>

       return c.ToPixelsY(18) &gt; 500

<p>For my project I need the above class to return what is in <code>FromPixelsY</code> when a call to <code>ToPixelsY</code> occurs.</p>

<p>Is there a way to do this? If I inherit the class and override or shadow these methods, when testPx calls function ToPixelsY, it would be actually calling CoordinateSpace method and not my new class' method.</p>

<p>This is in VB.net, but any .NET language for the solution is ok.
Hope this was clear, thanks!</p>

I am trying out a small shell scripting program.</p>

<p>In this program- I am trying to query a database with 2 tables. and trying to get a yes or no answer. </p>

<p>The <code>etag = md5sum</code> that I fetch from the file using a python script. </p>

<pre><code>echo 'select a.hash,b.hashuser, case when a.hash=b.hashuser then ""No!"" else ""yes!"" end from tempo b, hashes a where a.hash=b.hashuser and b.hashuser='$etag''
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to print it on my screen it shows it clearly that etag as the md5sum</p>

<p>But, If I try to query it on my database and try to fetch the result.  using the script given below</p>

<pre><code>sqlite3 hashez.db 'select a.hash,b.hashuser, case when a.hash=b.hashuser then ""No!"" else ""yes!"" end from tempo b, hashes a where a.hash=b.hashuser and b.hashuser='$etag''
</code></pre>

<p>This is the error that I get.</p>

<pre><code> Error: unrecognized token: ""579f0b61cf958a0eea2f60906e6a04a4""
</code></pre>

<p>After googling a little bit, this the solution I found from this <a href=""http://www.unix.com/shell-programming-scripting/146376-execution-problem-shell-script.html"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a></p>

<p>Then I changed it to <code>${#etag}</code></p>

<pre><code>echo 'select a.hash,b.hashuser, case when a.hash=b.hashuser then ""No!"" else ""yes!"" end from tempo b, hashes a where a.hash=b.hashuser and b.hashuser='${#etag}''
</code></pre>

<p>The error that I get now is </p>

<pre><code>select a.hash,b.hashuser, case when a.hash=b.hashuser then ""No!"" else ""yes!"" end from tempo b, hashes a where a.hash=b.hashuser and **b.hashuser=32**
</code></pre>

<p>Why is b.hashuser=32. is my first question.</p>

<p>Second problem:</p>

<p>When I try to query the database using the above function:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite3 hashez.db 'select a.hash,b.hashuser, case when a.hash=b.hashuser then ""No!"" else ""yes!"" end from tempo b, hashes a where a.hash=b.hashuser and b.hashuser='${#etag}''
</code></pre>

<p>I got no reply back.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is my query wrong. , If yes, why am I getting an answer when I query it directly on the database?</li>
</ul>

Thanks to openCV's <code>findContours()</code> method, I now have a list of 8-connected point for every contours. However, these lists are not directly usable, because they contain a lot of duplicates.</p>

<p><em>The problem</em> : <strong>Given a list of 8-connected points, which can contain duplicates, extract segments from it.</strong> </p>

<p>Possible solutions : </p>

<ul>
<li>At first, I used openCV's <code>approxPolyDP()</code> method. However, the results are pretty bad... Here is the zoomed contours : </li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/eLX8e.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here is the result of <code>approxPolyDP()</code> : (9 segments! Some overlap)</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/irdD9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>but what I want is more like : </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/IkrNP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>It's bad because <code>approxPolyDP()</code> can convert something that ""looks like several segments"" in ""several segments"". However, what I have is a list of points that tend to iterate several times over themselves.</p>

<p>For example, if my points are:</p>

<pre><code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
  9   
</code></pre>

<p>Then, the list of point will be <code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 9</code>... And if the number of points become large (>100) then the segments extracted by <code>approxPolyDP()</code> are unfortunately not duplicates (i.e : they overlap each other, but are not stricly equal, so I can't just say ""remove duplicates"", as opposed to pixels for example)  </p>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps, I've got a solution, but it's pretty long (though interesting). First of all, for all 8-connected list, I <strong>create  a sparse matrix</strong> (for efficiency) and set the matrix values to 1 if the pixel belongs to the list. Then, I create a <strong>graph</strong>, with nodes corresponding to pixels, and edges between neighbouring pixels. This also means that I <strong>add all the missing edges between pixels</strong> (complexity small, possible because of the sparse matrix). Then I <strong>remove all possible ""squares""</strong> (4 neighouring nodes), and this is possible because I am already working on pretty thin contours. Then I can launch a <strong>minimal spanning tree</strong> algorithm. And finally, I can approximate every branch of the tree with openCV's <code>approxPolyDP()</code></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/4488/segmentation.png"" alt=""segmentation""> </p>

<p>Here are fantastic pictures (thanks Paint!) of the original list, and the associated graph. Then, when I add edges between neighbours. And finally, when I remove edges and make a minimum spanning tree (not useful here)</p>

<p>To sum up : I've got a tedious method, that I've not yet implemented as it seems error-prone. However, I ask <strong>you</strong>, people at StackOverflow : are there other existing methods, possibly with good implementations?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit : To clarify, once I have a tree, I can extract ""branches"" (branches start at leaves or nodes linked to 3 or more other nodes) Then, the algorithm in openCV's <code>approxPolyDP()</code> is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer-Douglas-Peucker_algorithm"">Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm</a>, and here is the Wikipedia picture of what it does : </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/OCaAo.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>With this picture, it is easy to understand why it fails when points may be duplicates of each other</p>

<hr>

<p>Another edit : In my method, there is something that may be interesting to note. When you consider points located in a grid (like pixels), then generally, the minimal spanning tree algorithm is not useful because there are many possible minimal trees</p>

<pre><code>X-X-X-X
|
X-X-X-X
</code></pre>

<p>is fundammentally very different from</p>

<pre><code>X-X-X-X
| | | |
X X X X
</code></pre>

<p>but both are minimal spanning trees</p>

<p>However, in my case, my nodes rarely form clusters because they are supposed to be contours, and there is already a thinning algorithm that runs beforehand in the <code>findContours()</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Answer to Tomalak's comment : </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/iTMPT.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If DP algorithm returns 4 segments (the segment from the point <code>2</code> to the center being there twice) I would be happy! Of course, with good parameters, I can get to a state where ""by chance"" I have identical segments, and I can remove duplicates. However, clearly, the algorithm is not designed for it.</p>

<p>Here is a real example with far too many segments : </p>

<p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>

<p>I'm working with an external library which makes easier create forms from a XSD file. It parses the XSD and creates the needed panels and Swing elements to fill the data.</p>

<p>Well, to create the DOM used by the library I have to call the function <code>build(java.lang.String context, org.w3c.dom.ls.LSInput xsdInput, org.w3c.dom.Document w3CDOM, org.w3c.dom.ls.LSInput xuiInput, java.lang.String rootName, java.util.Hashtable domArgs)</code>. Here's the description of the parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>context</em>:  needed for client-capable systems for the ability to identify the right properties. I'm using a default context provided by the library.</li>
<li><em>xsdInput</em>: location of the XML schema</li>
<li><em>w3CDOM</em>: XML Instance Document</li>
<li><em>xuiInput</em>: location of the XUI Definition</li>
<li><em>rootName</em>: name of the root element</li>
<li><em>domArgs</em>: Dom specific arguments used on dom creation time (e.g. language).</li>
</ul>

<p>The link to the API: <a href=""http://www.jaxfront.org/member/java-core-api/com/jaxfront/core/dom/DOMBuilder.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jaxfront.org/member/java-core-api/com/jaxfront/core/dom/DOMBuilder.html</a></p>

<p><strong>PROBLEM</strong></p>

<p>I don't know how to obtain or create the <code>org.w3c.dom.ls.LSInput</code> objects. I received only the URLs to the XSD and the XUI files and I must in some way transform them into LSInput objects.</p>

<p>I'm using Xerces to work with XML files and here is my try to do this transformation:</p>

<pre><code>FileReader reader = null;
try
{
  reader = new FileReader(xui); // xui is a java.io.File to the xui
} (FileNotFoundException e2)
{
  error(e2); // Function to show and log errors
}
LSInput xuiInput = new DOMInputImpl(null, null, null, reader, ""UTF-8"");

try
{
  reader = new FileReader(xsd); // xui is a java.io.File to the xsd
} (FileNotFoundException e2)
{
  error(e2); // Function to show and log errors
}
LSInput xsdInput = new DOMInputImpl(null, null, null, reader, ""UTF-8"");

...
// code to get the other parameters
...
Document form = DOMBuilder.getInstance().build(""default-context"", xsdInput, w3cDOM, xuiInput, racine, null); // FIXME Throws NullPointerException?!?
</code></pre>

<p>I hope someone can explain me how works a LSInput and why this code don't works.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance! And if someone needs more information, ask me for it.</p>

<p>The method I'm using to do this is to calculate the nginx cache file name for each resource I want to purge, and then deleting that file. For the most part, this works well.</p>

<p>However, I've found that sometimes, even after the cache file is deleted, nginx will still return data from cache.</p>

<p>This is not a problem with selecting the correct cache file to delete -- as part of my testing, I've deleted the <em>entire</em> cache directory, and nginx still returns HIT responses</p>

<p>Is anyone aware of why this might be happening? Is it possible that another cache is involved? E.g., could it be that the OS is returning a cached version of the cache file to nginx, so nginx is not aware that it's been deleted?</p>

<p>Now, the User has the option to <strong>Like/Dislike</strong> a Post or a Topic.
I thought about three options:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Topic and Post don't have a connection (each Model has ""num_of_likes"", ""num_of_dislikes"")</li>
<li>Topic inherit Post.</li>
<li>Topic and Post inherit from a Base Model which can be called LikeableObj for example.</li>

After reading it a couple of times I figured out <code>randInt</code> is actually the method itself i am using to populate the array. So when it says to call <code>randInt</code> its some sort of recursive call I think. This is somehow what it should look like: </p>

<pre><code>  static int[] randInt(int i, int j) {
    int[] temp = new int[(j - i) + 1];
    for ( i = 0; i &lt; j; i++) {
        temp[i] = i + 1; // here i populate the array
    }
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(temp)); // this prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for ( i = 1; i &lt; j;i++){
        swapReferences(temp[i], temp[randInt(0,i)] ); //this is some sort of recursive call that swaps the references 
        // btw that statement does not compile, how can i pass a method as a parameter?



    }
    return temp;

<p>As per the requirement, I have a treeview, when user clicks on any node, it opens a sliding dialog with some controls in it. When user clicks on any node, it should first close the previously open dialog and then open the dialog for currently selected node. I am able to make this work when user clicks on the node, the dialog opens, and when user click back again on the same node or the slider-button, the dialog hides. But somehow, the code to hide when user click on any other node doesn't work properly. It moves the slider-button and the dialog away and I don't see anything.</p>

<p>I used the following code:</p>

<pre><code>if($('#slider-button').css(""margin-right"") == ""400px"") {
    $(sliderDialog).animate({""margin-right"": '-=400'});
    $('#slider-button').animate({""margin-right"": '-=400'});
} else{
    $(sliderDialog).animate({""margin-right"": '+=400'});
    $('#slider-button').animate({""margin-right"": '+=400'});

<p>I thought, it as simple as finding if the previously selected dialog is different than current than just call the same code that hides the dialog when user clicks on the same node again. ie. </p>

$('#slider-button').animate({""margin-right"": '-=400'});

AFAIK, this Login method isn't any different than other async methods so hopefully it applies. </p>

<p>So there is a Login.xaml page, that has a button for ""Login with Facebook"", and tapping this button takes you to the FacebookLogin.xaml page which contains only the <code>WebBrowser</code> control as per the linked Parse documenation. In <code>ContentPanel.Loaded</code> on FacebookLogin.xaml, I can use the following code to log in: </p>

<pre><code>async void FacebookLogin()
{
   try
   {
      user = await ParseFacebookUtils.LogInAsync(fbBrowser, new[] { ""user_likes"", ""email"" });
   }
   catch (OperationCanceledException oce)
   {
      // task was cancelled, try again
      //task = null;
      //FacebookLogin();
   }
   catch (Exception ex)
   {
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I actually log in, it works, and I can navigate the user to the next page. The problem happens when I let the browser control load (so the <code>async</code> method is <em>waiting</em>), and then hit the <strong>Back</strong> button, <strong>and then come back to the Facebook Login page again</strong>. </p>

<p>When I do this, an <code>OperationCancelledException</code> is thrown, but I'm not sure how to handle it. What I've tried:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the <code>catch</code> for the <code>OperationCanceledException</code>, set re-initialize the <code>WebBrowser</code> control to a new one. This had no effect.</p></li>
<li><p>In the same <code>catch</code>, call <code>FacebookLogin()</code> again, to retry. This also didn't work. </p></li>
<li><p>I've also tried not using <code>await</code> and returning a <code>Task&lt;ParseUser&gt;</code> but I wasn't sure how to go about doing that either.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is there something I can do with the cancellation exception, or use a <code>CancellationToken</code> to handle this better? I just want to properly handle the cancellation so that I can re-load the Facebook Login page if the user presses ""Back"".</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p>

<p>Ok, after much guidance from @JNYRanger, I have come up with a working solution. There may be a better way, but this seems to work. Here is the entire code from my FacebookLogin.xaml:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class LoginFacebook : PhoneApplicationPage
{
   Task&lt;ParseUser&gt; task;
   CancellationTokenSource source;

   public LoginFacebook()
   {
      InitializeComponent();
      ContentPanel.Loaded += ContentPanel_Loaded;
   }

   async void ContentPanel_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
   {
        try {
          source = new CancellationTokenSource();
          task = ParseFacebookUtils.LogInAsync(fbBrowser, new[] { ""user_likes"" }, source.Token);
          await task;

          // Logged in! Move on...
       }
       catch (Exception ex) { task = null; }     
   }

   protected override void OnBackKeyPress(System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs e)
   {
       if (task != null) source.Cancel(false);
       base.OnBackKeyPress(e);
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So basically, when ""Back"" is pressed, I use the <code>CancellationToken</code> to request a cancel, which throws an exception. When the exception occurs, I set <code>task</code> to null. Now, when re-navigating to the FacebookLogin page (without previously logging in), the <code>task</code> can be successfully recreated. </p>

<p>I looked at the output file and usually I get the rate limit message when I have about 5500-6500 tweet entities extracted. So to be conservative, I set that every time 4000 tweets (and the associated extracted fields) are extracted, I paused it for 20 min (to cover the Twitter's designated 15-min interval).</p>

<p>It almost works well but it doesn't. So for example, <code>[NC]</code> is supposed to make it case-insensitive. However, for some reason, when I type for example <code>localhost/Help</code> in the browser, for some strange reason, it redirects to home page. 
Another issue is with the last rule. If I type in <code>localhost/PlaceOrder/1</code> it works as expected and opens <code>index?p=mos&amp;gc=1</code>. But after that if I click on, for example, Account button, the browser uses this URL: <code>localhost/PlaceOrder/account</code>. Which is wrong. It should only use <code>localhost/account</code>. Why is it adding that sub-directory in there? It is only happening after the last rule is used. Prior to using the last rule, all links work well.</p>

Everything works fine most of the time, but some percentage of the time I get errors saying my controllers and services of the login page are undefined, so the controller doesn't properly load and values aren't bound.</p>

<p>I believe the problem stems from the order of execution of dependencies.  First, here are the errors:</p>

<p>So far I am only seeing this problem in Chrome, and when I have the javascript console open everything seems to work.  I have inserted a few console.log() statements to get some visibility into the order of activity within these scripts.  For three files, routeConfig.js, nav.js and usersService.js I have a console.log on the first line within the define function and another one on the first line of the angular definition function:</p>

"5137646","1","","","2011-02-28 02:20:42","","2","377","<p>HELP! I'm trying to create a hash table using Separate Chaining. For some unknown reason I cant seem to traverse and find all the original int I loaded. I suspect the modulo function is giving me bad addresses sometimes in both functions. First creating bad addresses on assorted int when creating the hash table and then sometimes searching the wrong addresses in the second function while attempting to traverse and confirm my list using modulo again. The hash table is populated by a basic random array of numbers and then I compare the created hash table with the original random array of int. Here is what I believe the culprit is causing all my troubles but I cant be 100% sure:</p>

<pre><code>address = randARRAY[key] % MAX_KEYS;
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the function for creating the Hash Table using Separate Chaining. I generally have MAX_KEYS = 5000, tbSIZE = 8989, which is better than 75% Load factor somewhere around 55%:</p>

<pre><code>void separateCHAINING(int *randARRAY,int tbSIZE,TABLE *head[]){
  int key = 0,
    address = 0,
    collisions = 0,
    newONE = 0;
  randARRAY[MAX_KEYS + 1] = 0;
  TABLE *newADDRESS[tbSIZE];
  newADDRESS[tbSIZE] = new TABLE();

  for(int a = 0; a &lt; tbSIZE; a++){
    newADDRESS[a] = NULL;
    head[a] = NULL;
  }

  while(randARRAY[key] != 0){
    address = randARRAY[key] % MAX_KEYS;
    newADDRESS[address] = new TABLE;
    newADDRESS[address]-&gt;key = randARRAY[key];
    if(head[address] != 0){
      newADDRESS[address]-&gt;next = head[address]-&gt;next;
      head[address]-&gt;next = newADDRESS[address];
      collisions++;
    }
    else{
      newADDRESS[address]-&gt;next = head[address];
      head[address] = newADDRESS[address]; 
      newONE++;   
    }
    key++;  
  }
  cout &lt;&lt; ""total collisions: "" &lt;&lt; collisions &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; ""new: "" &lt;&lt; newONE &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; ""added: "" &lt;&lt; collisions + newONE &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; ""key: "" &lt;&lt; key &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This created data appears to be passed without issue. I used gdb to create a ridiculously long list on one array index and it was all there in the second function without missing any nodes. This is why I think the addresses might be getting botched by modulo in both the function above and on this one below. This is apparently creating bogus addresses and then calling the wrong ones later. In the end Im never able to find all my int for the random array put in the Hash Table. Here is the function which uses modulo again and then tries to traverse and match the random array against the new hash table:</p>

<pre><code>void tableTWO_MATCH(int *randARRAY,TABLE *HT_TWO[]){
  int key = 0,
    address = 0,
    match = 0,
    nomatch = 0;
  randARRAY[MAX_KEYS + 1] = 0;

  while(randARRAY[key] != 0){
    address = randARRAY[key] % MAX_KEYS;
    while(HT_TWO[address]-&gt;next != NULL &amp;&amp; HT_TWO[address]-&gt;key != randARRAY[key]){         
      HT_TWO[address] = HT_TWO[address]-&gt;next;
    }//end second while 
    if(HT_TWO[address]-&gt;key == randARRAY[key]){
      match++;

    }//end if
    if(HT_TWO[address]-&gt;key != randARRAY[key]){
      nomatch++;            
    }//end if
    key = key + 1;
    address = 0;

  }//end outer while
  cout &lt;&lt; ""match: "" &lt;&lt; match &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; ""not match: "" &lt;&lt; nomatch &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; ""key: "" &lt;&lt; key &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

Throughout my code base I try to only create dependencies on them and not their concrete subclasses e.g. <code>SimpleTransformationMatrix44</code> and  <code>SimpleTranslationVector4</code>. The motivation for this is that I can use third party (adapted) classes in place of mine without much trouble.</p>

<p>I would like to overload the arithmetic operators (sourced from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operators_in_C_and_C%2B%2B#Arithmetic_operators"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>):</p>

<p>I want to declare them in the pure virtual classes so that it is valid to perform the operations on references/pointers to them, the problem being that an abstract class cannot be returned by value. The best solution I can think of is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt; T::operator +(const T&amp; b) const;
std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt; T::operator -(const T&amp; b) const;

<p>A pointer seems to be the only option in this case since returning a value is invalid and returning a reference is just plain silly.</p>

<p>In my example I didn't include any object properties which was what led me to use jquery's extend function. Although both answers solve inner functions ""inheritance"", it doesn't (obviously) merge object properties like extend does. As a possible solution I'm thinking after I create my instance to loop through the properties of the instance and apply jquery's extend on them.

It seems kind of ridiculous that Google is currently forcing people to use such a burdensome authentication system for things that they are <strong><em>trying to get people to try out</em></strong>? </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Kg1Pv.png"" alt=""SELECT returns zero rows""></p>

<p>I'm using PDO's <code>rollBack()</code> function after an <code>INSERT</code> statement. It works correctly, however after I truncate my table and make sure that the row count is being showed as <code>~0</code> in phpMyAdmin's panel, executing query and then rolling back causes row count being showed as <code>~1</code> (or how many rows I inserted and then rolled back).</p>

<p>When I select all the rows, there isn't any, but phpMyAdmin still shows not zero. I don't know if it's relevant to the application or to my code. Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>// begin the transaction
$this-&gt;db-&gt;beginTransaction();
// create sql query
$sql = ""INSERT INTO `table` (`name`) VALUES (?) "";
// prepare connection with the statement
$stmt = $this-&gt;db-&gt;prepare($sql);
// bind parameters to query
$stmt-&gt;bindParam(1, $this-&gt;name);
// execute the statement
$stmt-&gt;execute();
// just for testing
$this-&gt;db-&gt;rollBack();
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>My table is <code>InnoDB</code>.</li>
<li>I have selected all the rows with MySQL Workbench and still no rows.</li>
<li>There are rows if I don't roll back so I'm pretty sure that the query is working.</li>
<li>If I rollback a record and then insert new one without rolling back, selecting all returns 1 row but the shown count in the phpMyAdmin panel is still <code>~2</code>.</li>
<li>phpMyAdmin version is 4.1.13</li>
<li>PHP version is 5.4.24</li>
<li>MySQL Server version is 5.6.19</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this a bug or expected behaviour? If I keep rolling back some records, will it cause any trouble in the future such as returning incorrect row counts?</p>

<p>My app is validating the POST data and if a certain criteria is met, I want to redirect to a different location, but make sure the POST data is passed as POST data to that new page. Here's a rough example:</p>

<pre><code>POST /app1/example HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 17
    var1=foo&amp;var2=bar

<pre><code>HTTP/1.x 302 Found
Location: /app2/example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 17
    var1=foo&amp;var2=bar

<pre><code>$this-&gt;getResponse()-&gt;setRedirect('/app2/example/', 302);
$this-&gt;getResponse()-&gt;setBody(http_build_query($this-&gt;_request-&gt;getPost()));

<p>I am a complete newbie to programming and Stack Overflow, so I'm not sure if I am doing this correctly, but I figured I would give it a shot.</p>

<p>This is the problem:
Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer and prints two integers,
root and pwr, such that 0 &lt; pwr &lt; 6 and root**pwr is equal to the integer entered
by the user. If no such pair of integers exists, it should print a message to
that effect.</p>

<p>And here is my solution thus far:</p>

<pre><code>x = int(raw_input('Enter a positive integer: '))
root = 0
pwr = 0
while pwr &lt; 6:
    pwr += 1
    while root**pwr &lt; x:
        root += 1
if root**pwr == x:
    print ""The root is "" + str(root) + "" and the power is "" + str(pwr)
else:
    print ""No such pair of integers exists.""

                    console.log('attempting to render userProfileView.');

                        var ret = 'To simplify the example, I removed some code that procured and populated a template';

<p>so as I described, what is the best way to ensure that the events are listening to the right elements in the DOM, if the el for the view is not the same el as a render to? In other words, I render to the el defined by <code>$('#main-content-id')</code> in the render method, but the el for the view is just some div that Backbone created for me.</p>

<p>My controllers look like the following - an object is passed to the layout and it has some certain getter methods (e.g. getName()):</p>

<pre><code>public ModelAndView handleRequest(

        HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) throws Exception {
    return new ModelAndView(""t.jukebox"", ""jukebox"", facade);

<p>Everything was working fine. Recently, I decided to move to maven. After all work is done, all dependencies fixed and builds are successful, I lost the dynamic tiles expressions functionality and I can't find the reason. Some people suggest to add</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ page isELIgnored=""false"" %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>to the page, but I don't know where exactly. To the base tile layout or to the child? I've got one include.jsp, included by all jsp files, where I have all taglibs, but adding <code>elignored=false</code> didn't help.</p>

<p>It's probable that Maven has nothing to do with all this, I just don't know where to look for the solution.</p>

<p>I've solved the problem, it has to do with my adapter, and I'll post more in an answer,
but here's a link to a problem I'm having with the fix <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20456890/ember-get-not-getting-certain-attribute"">Ember get not getting certain attribute</a> </p>

<h2>Original Question</h2>

<p>I have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>customerSignUp: function () {
    var customer = this.get('store').createRecord('customer', {
        description: 'Why hello sir'
    });
    var model = this.get('model');
    model.set('customer', customer);
    customer.save().then(function() {
        model.save().then(function() {
            customer.set('user', model);
            customer.save();
        });
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the following backing models:</p>

<pre><code>App.User = App.Person.extend({
    name: DS.attr('string'), // Actually their primary email.
    customer: DS.belongsTo('customer', {async: true })
});

App.Customer = DS.Model.extend({
    user: DS.belongsTo('user', {async: true}),
    description: DS.attr('string')
});
</code></pre>

<p>(App.Person just passes along some naming conventions)</p>

<p>The <code>customerSignUp</code> function is trying to get <em>both</em> objects to refer to the other, so that either one could get attributes from the other as needed (the <code>user</code> model is planned to have more relationships like this in the future, so that one user can have multiple ""roles"" on the site).</p>

<p>The problem is that I can't get both to stably refer to each other. With this current implementation the model (user) points to the customer just fine, but the customer for some reason simply has it's user field set to <code>&lt;computed&gt;</code> in the Ember Debugger, and the record saved in the database doesn't even have a <code>user</code> field. It seems to me like <strong>some</strong> of my saves are overwriting the values or changing the underlying objects so they're no longer true? Honestly I'm just confused.</p>

<p>I've tried all kinds of different orderings of the <code>save</code>s and <code>set</code>s, but so far only one at a time works, or if both work, it's because I haven't saved one of them to the database. Any advice? Is this even necessary? Will the <code>customer</code> object have access to it's <code>user</code> even if there isn't an id explicitly stored in the <code>customer</code>?</p>

<p>Could this have to do with the <a href=""https://github.com/roundscope/ember-couchdb-kit"" rel=""nofollow"">adapter I'm using</a>?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>With this implementation of <code>customerSignUp</code>:</p>

<pre><code>customerSignUp: function () {
    var model = this.get('model');
    var customer = this.get('store').createRecord('customer', {
        description: 'Why hello sir',
        user: model
    });
    customer.save().then(function() {
    model.set('customer', customer);
        model.save();
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>customer</code> relationship on the <code>user</code> is set <strong>for a moment</strong>, but then resets to null. The <code>user</code> relationship is just <code>&lt;computed&gt;</code> and I don't think was ever set.</p>

<p>I have an EAR which contain my EJB project with remote and stateless ejb: <code>ABean.jar</code></p>

<p>Reading <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0609_alcott/0609_alcott.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Using Spring and Hibernate with WebSphere Application Server</a> I defined
in the <code>application.xml</code> of EAR project:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;module&gt;
    &lt;ejb&gt;ABean.jar&lt;/ejb&gt;

&lt;/module&gt;

&lt;resource-ref&gt;
    &lt;res-ref-name&gt;jdbc/b&lt;/res-ref-name&gt;
    &lt;res-type&gt;javax.sql.DataSource&lt;/res-type&gt;
    &lt;res-auth&gt;Container&lt;/res-auth&gt;
    &lt;res-sharing-scope&gt;Shareable&lt;/res-sharing-scope&gt;
&lt;/resource-ref&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In my spring context:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;jee:jndi-lookup
    id=""aDataSource"" 
    jndi-name=""jdbc/b"" 
    cache=""true"" 
    expected-type=""javax.sql.DataSource""/&gt;

&lt;bean id=""entityManagerFactory"" class=""org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""persistenceXmlLocation"" value=""META-INF/persistence.xml""/&gt;
    &lt;property name=""dataSource"" ref=""aDataSource"" /&gt;
    &lt;property name=""persistenceUnitName"" value=""APU""/&gt;

            &lt;prop key=""hibernate.show_sql""&gt;true&lt;/prop&gt;
        &lt;/props&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name=""jpaDialect""&gt;
        &lt;bean class=""org.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaDialect"" /&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt; 
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if I install application by WebSphere console, it ask to me to assign the jndi resource to <code>jdbc/b</code> (and it is ok), but if I try to call an ejb, a <code>NameNotFoundException</code> is throw because <code>jdbc/b</code> is not found!</p>

<p>Reading better the previous link i see:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For EJB JAR files, the same resource-ref should be declared in each EJB that needs to access the data source.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so I try to define resource references into my <code>ejb-jar.xml</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;enterprise-beans&gt;
&lt;session&gt;
   &lt;ejb-name&gt;TestServiceBean&lt;/ejb-name&gt;
   &lt;ejb-class&gt;it.test.TestServiceBean&lt;/ejb-class&gt;
   &lt;session-type&gt;Stateless&lt;/session-type&gt;
   &lt;transaction-type&gt;Container&lt;/transaction-type&gt;
   &lt;resource-ref&gt;

        &lt;res-type&gt;javax.sql.DataSource&lt;/res-type&gt;   
   &lt;/resource-ref&gt;
 &lt;/session&gt;
 &lt;/enterprise-beans&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I try to install again (I also assign the jndi resource to <code>jdbc/b</code>) and the call to the ejb run successfully, but if I have n ejb, do I need to assign n-times the same jndi resource to the n ejb resource-ref for jdbc/b?</p>

<p>What is wrong with my configuration? Isn't it possible ""point"" to the same <code>resource-ref</code> from all ejb? Do you have a complete example?</p>

We call these plugins internally, but they're more the modules that make up the total product. </p>

<p>The way this works is that the DLLs of these modules get copied to a directory, the application runtime (either a ServiceStack IIS web application or a Quartz-based console application) then does an <code>Assembly.LoadFile</code> for every module that is not in the list of current assemblies already loaded (<code>AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()</code>). </p>

<p>This <code>PluginLoader</code> only loads assemblies that are present in <code>plugins.config</code> file, but I think that's mostly irrelevant for the problem at hand.</p>

<p>The full code for the <code>PluginLoader</code> class:</p>

<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/JulianRooze/9f6d1b5e61c855579203"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/JulianRooze/9f6d1b5e61c855579203</a></p>

<p>This.... works. Sort of. It's fragile though and suffers from a problem that assemblies get loaded twice this way, from different locations (usually from the /bin/ folder of the application <em>and</em> the plugin directory). This seems to happen because at the moment the <code>PluginLoader</code> class is invoked, the <code>AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()</code> (at startup) does not necessarily return the final list of the assemblies that the program will load by itself. So if there's an assembly in the /bin/ called dapper.dll (a common dependency of both the core and many plugins/modules) that has not been used by the program yet, then it will not have been loaded yet (in other words: it loads them lazily). Then, if that dapper.dll is also by a plugin, the <code>PluginLoader</code> will see that it has not been loaded yet and will load it. Then, when the program uses its Dapper dependency, it will load the dapper.dll from /bin/ and we now have two dapper.dll's loaded. </p>

<p>In most cases, that seems to be fine. However, we make use of the RazorEngine library which complains about duplicate assemblies with the same name when you try to compile your templates.  </p>

<p>In investigating this, I came across this question:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2384592/c-net-is-there-a-way-to-force-all-referenced-assemblies-to-be-loaded-into-the"">C#/.NET: Is there a way to force all referenced assemblies to be loaded into the app domain?</a></p>

<p>I tried both the accepted answer and Jon Skeet's solution. The accepted answer works (though I haven't verified if there's any odd behavior yet) but it feels nasty. For one, this also makes the program try to load native DLLs that happen to be in /bin/ which obviously fails because they're not .NET assemblies. So you now have to try-catch-swallow this. I'm also worried about weird side effects if the /bin/ contains some old DLL that isn't actually used any more, but now gets loaded anyway. That isn't a problem in production, but it is in development (in fact, this whole thing is more of a problem in dev than production, but the added robustness of solving this would be appreciated in production as well). </p>

<p>As said, I also tried Jon Skeet's answer, and my implementation is visible in that Gist of the <code>PluginLoader</code> class in the method <code>LoadReferencedAssemblies</code>. This has two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>It fails on some assembly names, like <code>System.Runtime.Serialization</code> with a file not found. </li>
<li>It causes a failure later where a plugin is suddenly unable to find a dependency. I can't find why yet.</li>
</ol>

<p>I also briefly investigated using Managed Extensibility Framework, but I'm not sure if it applies. That seems to be more aimed at providing a framework for loading components and defining how they can interact, whereas I'm literally only interested in loading assemblies dynamically.</p>

<p>So, given the requirement ""I want to dynamically load a specified list of DLLs from a directory without any chance of loading duplicate assemblies"", what is the best solution? :)</p>

<p>I'm willing to overhaul how the plugin system works, if that's what it takes.</p>

I use window.external (which is actually my dialog class) to expose C++ functionality for JavaScript code inside browser. So, for example, when user wants to save settings, he clicks Save button, and in this event I call window.external like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
$(""#Save"").click(function() {
try
{
   window.external.Save();
}
catch(error)
{
   alert(error);
});
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>Now, in HTML dialog I have method like this:</p>

<pre><code>void CMyDialog::Save()
{
   // Do something...
}
</code></pre>

<p>If user entered invalid settings, it looks logical to generate exception within CMyDialog::Save() to stop method execution and show any error message. However, the problem here is that C++ exception must be processed by JavaScript, and I have no idea how to implement it.
So: <strong>is there any way to throw exception in C++ code in such a way that JavaScript will can handle it with its try-catch statement?</strong>
P. S. I understand that there are ways to avoid this problem, for example, it is possible to return error code from Save method instead of throwing exceptions and return 0 on success, etc; however, exceptions are much more comfortable &amp; intuitive way to report error at least for me, so if someone knows solution, please write your idea.</p>

I have been toying around with show(), hide(), and even toggle() but I can't figure out how to get the end result of clicking on the other links to re-hide and ONLY show the targeted DIV. I hope this makes sense.</p>

<p>I have a method in a class that manages the database for a ""quzzer"" feature in my app, it is intended to increment (or decrement in one case) three integer fields in an SQLite database. It needs to do this independently from the ""quizzing functions"", so I need to pull the data first, change it, then update it into the database.</p>

<p>The fields are as follows in the database:
""prof_level"" - Only acceptable values are 1 to 4 inclusive.
""times_correct"" - Only positive numbers.
""times_incorrect"" - Only positive numbers.</p>

<p>I can pull the numbers fine from the db then increment them by 1, but when I update, they increment the values in the db by 2 instead, and I've no idea why. Here is the full code of the method:</p>

<pre><code>    public void updateCharacterProf(String table, String charToUpdate, boolean isIncreased){
    //get character from table
    SQLiteDatabase db = getReadableDatabase();
    SQLiteQueryBuilder qb = new SQLiteQueryBuilder();

    qb.setTables(table);
    String[] projection = {""prof_level"", ""times_correct"", ""times_incorrect""};
    Cursor c = qb.query(db, projection, ""character=='"" + charToUpdate + ""'"", null, null, null,
                            null, null);

    c.moveToFirst();

    //check to see if the prof level is at max/min
    int profLevel = c.getInt(0);
    int correctTimes = c.getInt(1);
    int incorrectTimes = c.getInt(2);

    //mod prof levels
    if (isIncreased){
        profLevel++;
        correctTimes++;
    }
    else{
        profLevel--;
        incorrectTimes++;
    }

    if (profLevel == 4 &amp;&amp; isIncreased){
        profLevel = 4;
    }
    else if (profLevel == 1 &amp;&amp; !isIncreased){
        profLevel = 1;
    }

    c.close();

    ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
    values.put(""prof_level"", profLevel);
    values.put(""times_correct"", correctTimes);
    values.put(""times_incorrect"", incorrectTimes);

    //update db
    db.update(table, values, ""character=='"" + charToUpdate + ""'"", null);

    db.close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm hoping that it's just something I don't get about how updating SQLite dbs, but I'm lost at the ""var++ == +=2"" thing that I'm getting now.</p>

I followed the steps in <a href=""https://guides.cocoapods.org/making/using-pod-lib-create"" rel=""nofollow"">using-pod-lib-create</a> to create a swift pod. I did not choose to use a test framework to remove complexity. After, I added some ViewController subclass into the place under <em>Development Pods</em> (MyLib/Pod/Classes/SomeViewController.swift). 
My Problem now: I cannot reference this controller from within my AppDelegate. I can import the ""MyLib"" module and XCode will argue when I write that wrong, so I figure XCode is finding the module. Though I cannot use the controller which is inside that module. I did <em>pod install</em> a couple of times, checked the podspec, linted the podspec until all was fine, even the license. I cannot make it work. I also tried it with an ObjC-Pod-Configuration, but that also didn't work. Some time ago I did the same thing and it worked (for Swift using ObjC-Development-Pod) out of the box, so I am really confused by now. Can somebody give me another hint what it could be?</p>

<p>What happens at the moment is, 
It displays the results like:</p>

John (66) - here
Jack (36) - there
Jason (46) - here

Jack     (36)     - there
Jason    (46)     - here

<pre><code>$data = array();

{
while( $row = mysql_fetch_array($rs, MYSQL_ASSOC) )
{
    $data[] = array(

    );
}
}
echo json_encode($data);

<p>I need to get an image from my phone`s camera. I use formula to convert from YUV to RGB. Then I put RGB into IntBuffer. Then I copy pixels from IntBuffer into Bitmap. This way gives correct result.

<p>Long story short, I don't want that. There's some added functionality in the subclass's method that causes problems if it's called before the object is fully initialized. How can I, within the constructor of the superclass, force it to use its own version of the method, rather than the most specialized one?</p>

<p>Currently I'm using a buffer of 1M size to contain the recv message in read() (count is 4K bytes for read()). This is the max size of webpage I would like to crawl. However this is sort of waste so I'm also thinking about other approaches as below:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Send http HEAD request in the first round and read the content-length info from header. Create a char array with size of content-length and send http GET then to retrieve the content.<br>
<strong>Q1:</strong> What if the header info from server does not have content-lenght?<br>
<strong>Q2:</strong> This approach doubles the network traffic. Is it worthy paying such overhead?  </p></li>
<li><p>Send http GET directly and using a smaller buffer (e.g. 16K bytes). But not processing the response until all data is received, instead processing the data once the buffer is full and then clean the buffer to receive the rest.<br>
<strong>Q1:</strong> In this way the crawler may need a few iterations to read a large webpage completely. If the processing job is time-costly and multiple webpages are being read at the same time,  could the waiting data from network exceeds system buffer and cause packet loss?  </p></li>

<pre><code>Category | other data | other data 2 

Foods/Dog/Treats Pre-Pack | 1223 | image.jpg

<p>I need it to grab each line and add a new line below it for each ""/"" so turning the above into:</p>

<pre><code>Category | other data | other data 2 

[blank in original line] | 1223 | image.jpg

Foods | [blank field] | [blank field]

Foods/Dog | [blank field] | [blank field]

Foods/Dog/Treats Pre-Pack | [blank field] | [blank field]

<p>So the script needs to add a new line for each category but keeping the original category in front of it. So turning <code>category/category2/category 3</code> into 4 lines of: <code>[blank] - category - category/category2 - category/category2/category 3</code></p>

<p>I am searching through posts on a WordPress website. Just to keep things simple, I'm looking through the following columns in the posts table: <code>post_title</code> (Article Title), <code>post_name</code> (Article URL Slug), and <code>post_excerpt</code> (Article Summary).</p>

<p>Just to keep things even simpler for the sake of this question, let's say I have a search term of ""Floor Finish"", and I'm only searching through the column <code>post_title</code>. </p>

<p>As stated earlier, I'm looking for exact matches and broad matches.</p>

<p><strong>So three searches will be placed:</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li>Floor Finish</li>
<li>Floor</li>
<li>Finish</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>That would produce a query like:</strong></p>

<pre><code>( SELECT `ID`, `post_title` FROM `tps_3_posts` WHERE `post_status` = 'publish' AND `post_title` LIKE '%floor finish%' ) 

UNION 

( SELECT `ID`, `post_title` FROM `tps_3_posts` WHERE `post_status` = 'publish' AND `post_title` LIKE '%floor%' ) 

UNION 

( SELECT `ID`, `post_title` FROM `tps_3_posts` WHERE `post_status` = 'publish' AND `post_title` LIKE '%finish%' )
</code></pre>

<p>After examining my query, I began to realize that's not very efficient.</p>

<p>It's placing the ""Exact Match"" (""Floor Finish"") search first, followed by each of the ""Broad Match"" (""Floor"", ""Finish"") searches.</p>

<p>So the first go around, finds all posts with ""Floor Finish"" somewhere in the title of the article.</p>

<p>So there should already a list of ID's selected.</p>

<p>Now, when MySQL goes to place the second search (The first ""Broad Match"" (""Floor"") search.) It's looking through ALL posts to find an article title match containing ""Floor"". This includes looking through the same posts which have already been located from the exact match (Which I don't want -- Seems redundant.).</p>

<p>This same behavior is continued for each broad search. Thus causing unnecessary searching.</p>

<p>So is there any way, with multiple queries combined into one, that each following query DOESN'T look through posts which an <code>ID</code> (column), and <code>post_title</code> (column) has already been selected?</p>

<p>Or another way of wording it... Each query that's selecting the same columns, but has a different search term, checks to see if an <code>ID</code> (column) and <code>post_title</code> (column) has already been selected, and if so, ignore that <code>ID</code>, and continue looking for new <code>ID</code>'s which haven't already been selected.</p>

<p>Or does MySQL already handle that internally since I'm issuing multiple queries combined into one query?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>It seems I was over complicating it all. Using the selected answer, and querying all three columns as mentioned towards the top of my question. (<code>post_title</code>, <code>post_name</code>, <code>post_excerpt</code>)</p>

<p>The query looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>(

SELECT `ID` , `post_name` , NULL AS `post_title` , NULL AS `post_excerpt`
FROM `tps_3_posts`
WHERE `post_status` = 'publish' 
AND (
`post_name` LIKE '%floor-finish%' OR 
`post_name` LIKE '%floor%' OR 
`post_name` LIKE '%finish%'
)

) UNION (

SELECT `ID` , NULL AS `post_name` , `post_title` , NULL AS `post_excerpt`
FROM `tps_3_posts`
WHERE `post_status` = 'publish' 
AND (
`post_title` LIKE '%floor finish%' OR 
`post_title` LIKE '%floor%' OR 
`post_title` LIKE '%finish%'
)

) UNION (

SELECT `ID` , NULL AS `post_name` , NULL AS `post_title` , `post_excerpt`
FROM `tps_3_posts`
WHERE `post_status` = 'publish' 
AND (
`post_excerpt` LIKE '%floor finish%' OR 
`post_excerpt` LIKE '%floor%' OR 
`post_excerpt` LIKE '%finish%'
)

)

I'm using PyQt, but that's not really important as this is a Qt question not a Python question.</p>

<p>If I only needed the table and form views this would be easy, I'd just use the Qt Model/View framework. However I need the map view to provide functionality only really available using the Graphics View framework, which is essentially it's own Model/View framework with the QGraphicsScene acting as the data model.</p>

<p>I can think of two ways to do this. One would be to start with an authoritative model subclassed from QAbstractItemModel, link it to a subclass of QAbstractItemView and from there generate and update QGraphicsItems in the scene. This looks ugly though because I'm not sure how to handle user interaction with and changes to the data items though interaction with the QGraphicsItems.</p>

<p>The other way I can think to do it is to treat the QGraphicsScene as the authoritative data source, storing the data object in each QGraphicsItem's .data() property. I'd then subclass QAbstractItemModel and write it so that it accesses the data in the scene as it's data store, the other views would then use this as their model. How would I propagate changes to the data in the scene up to the model though?</p>

<p>Whichever approach I take, it looks like there's a gap not handled by the frameworks. In Model/View all changes are assumed to be made in the model. In Graphics View all changes are assumed to be made in the scene.</p>

<p>So which approach would you choose QAbstractItemModel(authoritative)->QAbstractItemView->QGraphicsScene or alternatively QGraphicsScene(authoritative)->QAbstractItemModel->Other Views. Why would you choose one over the other and what gotchas do you anticipate? Has anyone else needed to bridge this gap between Qt's twin model/view frameworks and how did you do it?</p>

<pre><code>$("".shareNow a"").on(""click"", function (event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    window.open(""http://www.google.com/share"");
    window.open(""http://www.twitter.com/share"");
    window.open(""http://www.fb.com/share"");
});

<p>its get data in my htc desire s shows all text-views on alertDialog and all the value that is fetch from internet, but when i run it on Emulator or other Android Devices it says force close with the above logcat, 
Help me if any one know the solution.

For my homework I'm supposed to make a Triangle and a TriangleTester class that manipulates values inputed using scanner to find the length of a triangles sides, angles, perimeter, etc.  I'm not asking you to do my homework but maybe point me in the right direction.  This is just a small part but it keeps me from continuing.</p>

<p>What I can't figure out is how to get the variables that I input move across methods (if that makes sense.</p>

<p>Here's my Triangle code:</p>

<pre><code>import java.math.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Triangle
{
private double A, B, C, D, h;
public double x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3;
public double lengthA, lengthB, lengthC;
private double angleA, angleB, angleC;
private double calcPerimeter, calcArea, getHeight;

//Create new Triangle
public Triangle(){
}

//to get length of a (AB) use A = (x1, y1) &amp; B = (x2,y2)
public double getLengthC(){
double distance = Math.sqrt((Math.pow((x1-x2),2))+(Math.pow((y1-y2),2)));
return distance;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my TriangleTester code:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;

public class TriangleTester
{
public static void main(String[]args)
{
Triangle triangle1 = new Triangle();

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(""Enter x1 for point A"");
double x1 = scan.nextDouble();
System.out.println(""Enter y1 for point A"");
double y1 = scan.nextDouble();
System.out.println(""Enter x2 for point A"");
double x2 = scan.nextDouble();
System.out.println(""Enter y2 for point A"");
double y2 = scan.nextDouble();
System.out.println(""Enter x3 for point A"");
double x3 = scan.nextDouble();
System.out.println(""Enter y3 for point A"");
double y3 = scan.nextDouble();
System.out.println(""Set up a Triangle with coordinates "" +""(""+x1+"",""+y1+"")""+ "",""+ ""(""+x2+"",""+y2+"")"" +"",""+ ""(""+x3+"",""+y3+"")"");

System.out.println(""Length of side c "" + triangle1.getLengthC());
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>For testing purposes I would like to input the values:</p>

<pre><code>0
0
4
0
3
3
</code></pre>

<p>and have the length of side c calculate to a 4.  I see that when I use the variable within my TriangleTester class the variables work, but when I call a method from my Triangle class the values don't work.</p>

<p>From where I'm at I would think I have to manipulate the triangle class so that my inputs from scanner are moved into that area....or I could be wrong</p>

<pre><code>public Triangle(){} //I would have to add something here maybe?

<p>I have a series of Log files (text format) from various servers with columns of information. I have two Powershell scripts (below) which seek and calculculate details from certain coulmns and outputs a text file.</p>

<p>Example Log Files:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.megaupload.com/?d=63XS8VKA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=63XS8VKA</a></p>

<p>Script #1 (Combined RTP Packet(s) lost)</p>

<p>This script will look at the ""Details"" column in the log file and calculate all the "" XX RTP Packet(s) have been lost"" (eg. 57 RTP Packet(s) have been lost)</p>

<p>The script can be executed in any directory or folder that contains (*.log) files and will give you a total amount of RTP Packet(s) lost.</p>

<pre><code>  $sum = 0 
  foreach ($i in dir -filter *.log -Rec)
  {
  $sum += (gc $i.fullname | select -Skip 5 | ConvertFrom-Csv -Delimiter ""`t"" | ? {$_.Details -  match ""^(\d+)""} |% {$matches[1]} | Measure-Object -Sum).Sum
  }
  $sum | Tee-Object -FilePath .\CombinedResults.txt
  [Console]::Write(""Press any key to continue . . . "")
  [Console]::ReadKey()
</code></pre>

<p>Script #2 (Total RTP Packet(s) lost by Entity)</p>

<p>This script will look at the ""Details"" column in the log file and calculate all the "" XX RTP Packet(s) have been lost"" (eg. 57 RTP Packet(s) have been lost) it than will show you the total packets lost per Entity (camera) the entity name is found in the ""Entity"" Column.</p>

<p>The script can be executed in any directory or folder that contains (*.log) files and will give you a total amount of RTP Packet(s) lost per entity.</p>

<pre><code> $out=foreach ($i in dir -filter *.log -Rec)
 {
 $cameras = gc $i.fullname | select -Skip 5 | ConvertFrom-Csv -Delimiter ""`t"" | group ""Entity ""
 $cameras | select Name, @{n=""Total"";e={ ($_.group | ? {$_.Details -match ""^(\d+)""} |% {$matches  [1]} | Measure-Object -Sum).Sum}} | ? {$_.Total -gt 0} 
 }
 $out | Tee-Object -FIlePath .\ByEntityResults.txt 
 [Console]::Write(""Press any key to continue . . . "")
 [Console]::ReadKey()
</code></pre>

<p>Here is what I'm trying to acheive:</p>

<p>These log files come from various servers, and I want results to be filterd by server. In the log files on the top left corner it states ""Computer Name:""</p>

<p>For both scripts I would like the results to be filterd by Computer Name.</p>

<p>End Result Example:</p>

<pre><code>  Script # 1

 Computer Name: T3-Archiver24

 Total RTP Packet(s) lost = 8837


 Script # 2

<p>I have been looking and testing this for a couple days now and was wondering if anyone could point me in a different direction. I have a very long job application HTML form (jobapp.html) and a matching PDF (jobpdf.pdf) that have the same field names for all entries in both the HTML form and the PDF. I need to take the user data that is entered in the form and convert it to a PDF. This is what I have gathered so far but don't know if I am on track:</p>

<p>Is pdftk the only viable 3rd party app to accomplish this?</p>

<p>Using pdftk would i take the $_POST data collected for the user and generate a .fdf(user.fdf) then flatten the .fdf on the .pdf(job.pdf). So irregardless of where the fields are located on each document the information on the fdf would populate the pdf by field names?</p>

I have a JQuery plugin that wraps my Knockout view models to expose utility methods like <em>.reset()</em>, <em>.isDirty()</em>, and so on.</p>

<p>I have a method called <em>.setBaseline()</em> that essentially takes a <strong>snapshot</strong> of the data model once it has been populated (via the mapping plugin). Then I can use this snapshot to quickly determine if the model has changed.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is some kind of <strong>general purpose function</strong> that can return an object that represents <strong>the differences between two 2 JavaScript objects</strong> where one of the objects is considered to be the master.</p>

<p>For example, assume that this is my snapshot:</p>

<pre><code>var snapShot = {
  name: ""Joe"",
  address: ""123 Main Street"",
  age: 30,
  favoriteColorPriority: {
     yellow: 1,
     pink: 2,
     blue: 3
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Then assume that the live data looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var liveData = {
    name: ""Joseph"",
    address: ""123 Main Street"",
    age: 30,
    favoriteColorPriority: {
        yellow: 1,
        pink: 3,
        blue: 2
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>I want a <em>.getChanges(snapShot, liveData)</em> utility function that returns the following:</p>

<pre><code>var differences = {
    name: ""Joseph"",
    favoriteColorPriority: {
        pink: 3,
        blue: 2
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>I was hoping that the <strong>_.underscore library</strong> might have something like this, but I couldn't find anything that seemed to work like this.</p>

<p>So far, this works great, because now I don't have to specify the error handler function in 50 different places.</p>

<p>But sometimes I need to override the default error handler with a custom one. When I do this, however, it calls <em>both</em> error handlers:</p>

<pre><code>myAjaxFunction(""myurl"", ""mydata"").fail(myCustomErrorHandler).then(doSomething);

<p><a href=""http://www.raceramps.com/v2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raceramps.com/v2</a></p>

<p>Move your mouse over the menu on the right side. Notice how Car Service, Trailer Hauling, and Show &amp; Display are fully enlarged by default. This is because they are higher selling products, and most people who view this site are looking for those. </p>

<p>Currently there is an accordion menu setup using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>$(function(){
    $( '.buttonEffectWrapper' ).hover (
        function () {

            var effect = $(this).siblings().filter("":last"");
            effect.stop ().animate ( { opacity: 1}, { duration: 300 } );

            $(this).stop().parent().animate({height: ""110px""}, {duration: 300 } );//accordion effect here


        },
        function () {
                    var effect = $(this).siblings().filter("":last"");
                  effect.stop ().animate ( { opacity: 0}, { duration: 300 } );

                  $(this).stop().parent().animate({height: ""30px""}, {duration: 300 } );//accordion effect here

        }
    );
} );
</code></pre>

<p>Firstly, if you move the mouse horizontally over one of the buttons several times, it builds a queue. I thought using stop() was supposed to fix this, but it doesn't seem to be.</p>

<p>Secondly, I don't want the first three divs (#car-service, #trailer-hauling, and #display-and-show) to collapse when the mouse leaves. I tried the following, but it selects <em>everything</em> else.</p>

<pre><code>  $(this + "":not(#car-service, #trailer-hauling, #display-and-show)"").stop().parent().animate({height: ""30px""}, {duration: 300 } );
</code></pre>

<p>and thirdly, if you mouseover one div, and then move to one below it, as one div expands and the other collapses, your mouse ends up in a position you wouldn't intend. The only way I can think of to fix this is to not allow the previous div to collapse. </p>

<p>So if I moused over <code>#car-service</code>, then went to <code>#trailer-hauling</code>, <code>#car-service</code> shouldn't collapse. But If I move from <code>#trailer-hauling</code> to <code>#show-and-display</code>, then I want <code>#car-service</code> to contract. This should prevent the interface from being broken.</p>

Most of the times the solution suggested is to use <a href=""http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/workers/basics/"" rel=""nofollow"">Web Workers</a>.</p>

<p>A game I'm developing requires me to run multiple functions at the same time. One of them is an on <code>click</code> function and other is a <code>setInterval</code>.<br/>
My approach at doing this can be seen <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/kP7C6/3/"" rel=""nofollow"">here in this JSFiddle</a>. (keep clicking in gray area to make player jump).</p>

<p>The whole idea is to continuously spawn those blue obstacles after an interval of 1000ms. </p>

<p>In my earlier approach the obstacles would spawn only when I click to make player jump, otherwise they wouldn't as expected.</p>

<hr>

<ol>
<li><p>How can I run such two functions side by side in order to achieve
the aim of spawning obstacles while also making player jump.</p></li>
<li><p>Secondly, what would be the best approach to carry out this process
in view of game development i.e attaining a certain level of
efficiency so that the animations are not affected.</p></li>

<p>I've tried the following code in order to read the input :</p>

<pre><code>uint16_t twoBytes;
scanf(""%x"",&amp;twoBytes);
</code></pre>

<p>Thats works fine and all, but how do I split the 2bytes in 1bytes <code>uint8_t</code> values (or maybe even read the first byte only). Would like to read the first byte from the input, and store it in a byte matrix in a position of choosing.</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t matrix[50][50]

<p>Since I'm not very skilled in formating / reading from input in C/C++ (and have only used scanf so far) any other ideas on how to do this easily (and fast if it goes) is greatly appreciated .</p>

<p>Edit: Found even a better method by using the fread function as it lets one specify how many bytes it should read from the stream (stdin in this case) and save to a variable/array.</p>

<pre><code>size_t fread ( void * ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE * stream );
</code></pre>

<p>Parameters</p>

<p>ptr - Pointer to a block of memory with a minimum size of (size*count) bytes.</p>

<p>size - Size in bytes of each element to be read.</p>

<p>count - Number of elements, each one with a size of size bytes.</p>

<p>stream - Pointer to a FILE object that specifies an input stream. </p>

<p>[EDIT] Alternatively for number 2: maybe shrink the details field, and display the picture as a banner like label just below it (so that the details field would occupy only half the space vertically, and the other half below it would be used by the picture - that way a user can see both the progress and the ""banner"").</p>

<p>[EDIT] Even better still would be to have some sort of basic slide show: define several pictures and rotate them every 10 seconds</p>

<p>The idea behind this is that during parts of the installation that may take some time (say over 10 seconds) to display something more informative / valuable to the user, such as how to get started graphic, a sales promotion or something else.</p>

<p>you see my <strong>Gallery</strong> and <strong>Image</strong> model. While creating an <strong>Image</strong> in the Backend it should create a folder dynamicly in <em>""img/gallery/gallery_id""</em></p>

<p>my problem is that <strong>Image.gallery</strong> is a ForeignKey here and I cant convert it into a int or string to use it. Is there a function to get the ID from my <strong>Gallery</strong> object with the ForeignKey from my <strong>Image</strong> object?</p>

<p>my solution</p>

I know the RDP screen of both of these versions are different , for example: if we RDP a Win2k3 machine, it gives a warning notice first and once we click Ok, it takes us to the credentials screen , but in case of Win2k8, it directly takes us to Crendentials which is a proof of the OS on the server. Doing this manually for 1500 servers is a time consuming task.
Can we implement this RDP screen logic using a script to find out the Windows OS version.</p>

<p>I can imagine an Algorithm something like that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Enter server name.</li>
<li>Invoke <code>mstsc</code> for that server</li>
<li>Verify if the dialogue box is a direct prompt for credentials or not?</li>
<li>If so, print Windows 2k8, else 2k3/2k.</li>
</ol>

<p>If this logic successful on one server, I can use it in a <code>foreach</code> loop for all servers and export in in Excel.</p>

<p>I'm extremely new to Perl / MySQL / Linux (Ubuntu), so there is every chance that I'm doing something ridiculous. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If i'm asking in the wrong place, sorry.</p>

<p>I'm trying to install a sequence database using the installDBRNASEQ.pl script which is part of a larger bioinformatics pipeline called GENE-counter that assesses transcriptomic data against a genome (<a href=""http://sourceforge.net/p/genecounter/home/GENE-counter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/p/genecounter/home/GENE-counter/</a>). </p>

<p>I have set up a MySQL database, I can log in and out without any problems, but when I run the command below from the appropriate folder location (-n, refers to organism of interest -v, to the genome version, -i is the input file(s) location, -d is the name of the mysql database, -f is required by the script itself)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>perl installDBRNASEQ.pl -n Arabidopsis -v TAIR10 -i /home/jonny -d rnaseq -f</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I keep get the following error message, and I've been trying to work-around for the last week:</p>

<p>""DBI connect('rnaseq:;mysql_local_infile=1','',...) failed: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO) at /usr/local/lib/perl/GENE-counter-v0.4.4/src/installRNASEQ/../commonRNASEQ/commonRNASEQ.pm line 321.
Error: cannot connect to supplied database.""</p>

<p>I have tried propmting for a password using below, and derivatives thereof:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>perl installDBRNASEQ.pl -n Arabidopsis -v TAIR10 -i /home/jonny -d rnaseq -f -p</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure I expect that to work however as I'm running everything through Perl here. I can run another terminal window, connect to the relevant MySQL database etc., but I don't know how to specify a password and connect to the database using the above command?</p>

<p>Any thoughts /comments would be greatly appeciated. If anyone is willing to help I can post more info as needed.</p>

<p>The class KeyMapper is basically a synchronized wrapper to HashMap with only two functions, one to add a mapping and one to remove a mapping. When running in Tomcat 6.24 on my 32bit Windows machine everything works fine. However when running on a 64 bit Linux machine (CentOS 5.4 with OpenJDK 1.6.0-b09) I add one mapping and print out the size of the HashMap used by KeyMapper to verify the mapping got added (i.e. verify size = 1). Then I try to retrieve the mapping with another request and I keep getting null and when I checked the size of the HashMap it was 0. I'm confident the mapping isn't accidentally being removed since I've commented out all calls to remove (and I don't use clear or any other mutators, just get and put).  </p>

<p>The requests are going through Tomcat 6.24 (configured to use 200 threads with a minimum of 4 threads) and I passed -Xnoclassgc to the jvm to ensure the class isn't inadvertently getting garbage collected (jvm is also running in -server mode). I also added a finalize method to KeyMapper to print to stderr if it ever gets garbage collected to verify that it wasn't being garbage collected.</p>

<p>I'm at my wits end and I can't figure out why one minute the entry in HashMap is there and the next it isn't :(</p>

"4280133","1","","","2010-11-25 18:58:45","","1","353","<p>I have an application into which I wish to allow users to enter login details for their own websites. One of authentication methods is 'forms'. The way I had envisaged it working, is the users entering the method &amp; action of their login form, and the name/value for each credential item, e.g. one for username, one for password. My application would then post this data in order to simulate a login, get the returned authentication cookie and be able to work on their site as if logged in.</p>

<p>In principle, this sounded like a reasonable kind of thing to do. However, as I'm sure you're aware, ASP.NET has a lot of inputs, and also hidden ones, e.g. __VIEWSTATE, which are all always posted back to the server whenever the ASP.NET form is submitted e.g. when a <em>real</em> user logs in. When my app tries to login however, it doesn't have the full list of inputs on that page, and their values, e.g. the always changing __VIEWSTATE.</p>

<p>My question: is there a way to post data to an ASPX page, posting <em>only</em> certain inputs, and excluding others, e.g. __VIEWSTATE?</p>

<p>If the page were, say, PHP it would probably look like this:</p>

<p>Ex. 1:</p>

<pre><code>...
&lt;div id=""header""&gt;
    &lt;form action=""search.php"" action=""POST""&gt;
        &lt;div id=""search""&gt;
            &lt;input type=""text"" name=""query"" id=""SearchQueryText"" value=""Search query"" /&gt;
            &lt;input type=""button"" name=submit"" id=""SearchSubmitButton"" value=""Search!"" /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;form action=""login.php"" action=""POST""&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""uname"" id=""Username"" value=""Username"" /&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""passwd"" id=""Password"" value=""Password"" /&gt;
        &lt;input type=""button"" name=submit"" id=""LoginSubmitButton"" value=""Login"" /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    ...
&lt;/div&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>in ASP.NET Web Forms, however, through the use of server controls, it'd probably look like:</p>

<p>Ex. 2:</p>

<pre><code>...
&lt;body&gt;    
    &lt;form name=""AspNetForm"" method=""post"" action=""/Products/SomethingOrOther.aspx"" id=""Form"" enctype=""multipart/form-data""&gt;
        &lt;div id=""header""&gt;
            &lt;div id=""search""&gt;
                &lt;input type=""text id=""ctl00$SearchComponent$SearchBox"" name=""ctl00$SearchComponent$SearchBox"" value=""Search query"" /&gt;
                &lt;input type=""submit"" id=""ctl00$SearchComponent$SearchSubmit"" name=""ctl00$SearchComponent$SearchSubmit"" value=""Search!""&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div id=""login""&gt;
                &lt;input type=""text id=""ctl00$LoginComponent$Username"" name=""ctl00$LoginComponent$Username"" value=""Username"" /&gt;
                &lt;input type=""text"" id=""ctl00$LoginComponent$Password"" name=""ctl00$LoginComponent$Password"" value=""Password""&gt;
                &lt;input type=""submit"" id=""ctl00$LoginComponent$LoginSubmit"" name=""ctl00$LoginComponent$LoginSubmit"" value=""Login""&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>With example 1, submitting the login form is a simple case of POSTing uname=something&amp;passwd=somethingelse to login.php, however, in ASP.NET, because all inputs are wrapped in a 'global' <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, to submit the login inputs, you have to submit the global form, and therefore all the inputs.</p>

<p>So what I'm after, is a way to submit <em>only</em> certain inputs in that global form, e.g. not __VIEWSTATE, which we can't know without probing the page beforehand.</p>

<p>NOTE: transitionImage method get's fired when an image is added to the self.images array via an observer on the self.images didSet. </p>

<pre><code>func transitionImage()
{

    //reload the slideshow data and restart from 0

    //if it's a new image start the slideshow
    if (self.images.count == 1){
        self.slideShow.runSlideshowWithDataSource(self, inMode: IKSlideshowModeImages, options: [IKSlideshowStartPaused:false])
    }
    else{

            NSLog(""new image added, reloading Data"")
            self.slideShow.reloadData()
    }
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>When I fire the event in the first, WaitForSingleObject does not detect the event so I am guessing the answer is no unless I missed some trick in the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682396%28VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES structure?</a></p>

<p>Or perhaps I need to use a named event and call OpenEvent()?</p>

<p>In this case I cannot use window messages because I am trying to signal a windows service. I could use the pipe, but there will be many of these applications, and I would like to find a ""low cost"" solution if possible.</p>

<p>Other options like Memory mapped files have even more overhead than the pipe?</p>

I communicate with another program via one socket. And the data transfer through the socket works perfectly even after the SIGPIPE. Is this possible? SIGPIPE due to a temporary network hickup? </p>

if(mysqli_stmt_num_rows($stmt) == 1) {

} else {
    // Insert $student_id into database
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code can insert the ID into the database if <code>mysqli_stmt_num_rows($stmt) == 0</code>. But, if the ID already exists, it won't generate a new 6 digit random ID, it won't check if that ID already exists in the database, etc. I can imagine that I would have to use some kind of loop which will keep generating a random ID untill it doesn't exists in the database and then insert it into the database. I've read about a few loops (like <code>while</code> or <code>for</code>), but I don't have any idea how to use them.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me out with this or help me in the right direction?</p>

<p>As per Rayon's Comment I'm doing the following:</p>

<p>This is appending the base64 to the form data on my main page every time a filter is clicked. Thus, when someone clicks upload it will send that data to the pho script.</p>

<pre><code>var fd = new FormData(document.getElementById(""fileinfo""));
fd.append(""file_upload"", clone[0].toDataURL(""image/png;base64;""));
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my current JavaScript for handling the AJAX request:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>function submitForm() {
  if (get_user != logged_username) {} else {
    var d = new Date();
    var time = d.getTime();
    //console.log(document.getElementById(""file""));
    var fd = new FormData(document.getElementById(""fileinfo""));
    //console.log(fd);
    fd.append(""username"", logged_username);
    fd.append(""timestamp"", time);
    $.ajax({
      url: ""upload_photo.php"",
      type: ""POST"",
      data: fd,
      enctype: 'multipart/form-data',
      processData: false, // tell jQuery not to process the data
      contentType: false // tell jQuery not to set contentType
    }).done(function(data) {
      if (data.indexOf(""Invalid"") &gt;= 0) {
        alert('invalid file type, must be jpeg, jpg, or png.');
      } else {
        var post = {
          ""pic_location"": data,
          ""time"": time,
          ""username"": logged_username
        };
        console.log(data);
        var json_data = post;
        Cynergi.insert('http://thhd.com:3000/profile_pictures', json_data);
        //this is where we save the photos location to the db for retrieveal.
      }
    });
    return false;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then the php:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;?php

    // requires php5
    define('UPLOAD_DIR', 'images/profile_images/');
    $img = $_POST['file_info'];
    $img = str_replace('data:image/png;base64,', '', $img);
    $img = str_replace(' ', '+', $img);
    $data = base64_decode($img);
    $file = UPLOAD_DIR . uniqid() . '.png';
    $success = file_put_contents($file, $data);
    echo $file;
    print $success ? $file : 'Unable to save the file.';

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>logging output shows:</p>

<p>php returns unable to save file, and it saves a file with 0 bytes.</p>

<p>I am thinking how exactly the reverse proxy plugins is coded?</p>

<ol>
<li>I know they parse the request and see to which server it should be routed to. </li>
<li>Do they then create a thread for every connection from the end user and then delegate that thread the responsibility to connect to right server. </li>
<li>Keep on accepting more requests from other clients and creating similar threads.</li>
<li>When thread gets the response from server, reply with that to the client. And close the thread. Or do they have a thread pool?</li>
</ol>

<p>I am thinking about it from C++ angle. If multithreading is used to increase the proxy's throughput.</p>

<p>Technology used : GWT.
Login url = Login.html and Login Failure url = Login.html?error=true</p>

<p>as shown above, the login page (made in GWT) can determine that whether its just opened for first time or whether its opened after an error.</p>

<p>However, i am not able to determine the type of error
a similar post here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1373407/how-to-display-custom-error-message-in-jsp-for-spring-security-auth-exception"">Post link</a> shows how to set the message to a custom one,
But i require a programming approach:
eg if open id login fails, I must show user a panel to enter his name, etc.</p>

<p>Is there any way to achieve this ?</p>

<p>For those not knowing GWT:</p>

<p>Let me change the problem a bit, suppose that my login page is not a JSP but a servlet, how do i write code in my servlet that is able to access the type of error occured during login? (Actually this does not solve the GWT issue, but it may give me a 'heads up' of what is needed to be done.) </p>

That works fine for the local queue (named ""queue"").<br>
After researching online I was able to figure out if I want to queue a message to a remote location of an MSMQ, it's PathName needs to look something like <code>FormatName:Direct=TCP:[ip]\\private$\\[queuename]</code></p>

<pre><code>$msgQueueInfo =  new COM(""MSMQ.MSMQQueueInfo"") or die(""Couldn't create"");
$msgQueueInfo-&gt;PathName = ""FormatName:Direct=TCP:10.0.0.8\private$\queue"";

$msgQueue = new COM(""MSMQ.MSMQQueue"") or die(""Couldn't create"");
$msgQueue = $msgQueueInfo-&gt;Open(2, 0);

<p>Each time I try to run my code above I get the following error message ""<b>Source:</b> MSMQQueueInfo<br/><b>Description:</b> The queue path name specified is invalid.""</p>

<p>It queues the message successfully to the local queue if the path is set to "".\private$\queue"" but why does it not take the remote queue path that I provide? Anything wrong with my code? Anything I have to enable? Anything I'm missing?</p>

We're trying to connect the <a href=""http://www.intersense.com/pages/16/16/"" rel=""nofollow"">NavChip</a> to it and do some experiments related to robot navigation. The NAO uses a modified 2.6 linux kernel on it's geode system. I've managed to make my NavChip work on it (needed to compile the linux cp210x kernel module etcetera). I can therefore run a C program that came with the NavChip and collect data from it. However, the data can only be logged on the local file system. I'd like to stream this data over the network to a windows machine, since all the processing is MATLAB based. Would anyone have any suggestions on how I can send this data from the NAO to a windows machine?</p>

<p>The NAO's system is pretty limited. It has ssh, and some common utilities like cat etc., but nothing advanced.</p>

<p>I tried different things but nothing seems to actually attach the file.</p>

<p>Or, can I override UploadAttachment() so when the user clicks a button it shows the file selector dialog directly and after they are done I get notified so I can do something?</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Use Case:</p>

<p>I have a list. The list has a title, description (memo), an image path, and a ""read more"" path. The image and ""read more"" path are single line of texts. The user would do one of two things: provide the URL to a file that is already online, or <strong>click ""browse"" to select a file to be attached to the item</strong>.</p>

<p>It is that last part I need help with. I can edit the NewForm.aspx to add a ""

<p>I can't use the default attach item because I need to know what file is for what, image or ""read more"". Which is why I want a button for ""image"" and ""read more"" so that after the user selects a file I can store some details that will later let me identify what file is what.</p>

<p>My plan was to override the ""save"" button so that my code runs instead of the default.</p>

<p>Then I would use SPServices to create the item. </p>

<p>Then:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can't use FileReader so I cannot use the AddAttachment web service</li>
<li>I can't use the existing ""/_layouts/attachFile.aspx"" because it won't let me dynamically set the file path</li>
<li>I can't seem to create my own form dynamically that would attach the file</li>
<li>I can call ""UploadAttachment()"" but that changes screens after the user clicks ""OK"" I won't know so I can't save the details I need</li>

I am running this as a supervisor process and even without receiving the connection draining message, i.e control message from google ccs server my program seems to be not receiving the messages after sometime. None of my callbacks are called because connection is not closed, ended or no error happened.</p>

<p>Although I don't have proper idea on different available callbacks, I have added callback on error, end, close to exit from the process so new process is spawned by supervisor.</p>

<p>The controllers all use InheritedResources, so I have access to some helper variables such as <code>resource</code>, which I use to display the attributes for the model being shown through <code>resource.attributes</code> in my parent view.</p>

<p>What I would like to be able to do is whitelist which attributes are being shown in each model. I have thought of two ways to do this... the first is to define some method in a class my model's inherit from, say it is called <code>attr_visible</code> and define each attribute in the model. The reason I don't like this approach is that it puts too much of the view logic in the models. I would rather provide my views with the model, and let the view determine what is displayed.</p>

<p>The second approach is what this question is about. I want to have a file <code>/app/views/users/show.html.erb</code>, and set which attributes for a User I would like to be shown, say something like:</p>

<pre><code>@attributes = [:name, :email, :etc]
</code></pre>

<p>And then pass them to the parent view which I described in the beginning of this question. That view would then be able to loop through <code>@attributes</code> and display the attributes necessary.</p>

<p>Is it possible to use a ""<code>super</code>""-type method from views? Everything I have read about view inheritance suggests the view is loaded based on where it is located in the directory structure, and then after that you're out of luck.</p>

<p>edit: I have sort of done what I want. I defined a partial _show.html.erb in the /app/views/users directory that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% @attributes = ['name', ...] %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then in the parent view I call <code>&lt;%= render ""show"" %&gt;</code> before looping through <code>@attributes</code>. This works, but feels clunky since I am not actually rendering anything when I call <code>render</code>. Is there a better way?</p>

<p>I am not asking for a solution, I am just looking for a direction.</p>

<p>PART 1 <br>
Some text first.</p>

<p>The input to the program is: </p>

<ul>
<li>a number of weights</li>
<li>weights themselves     </li>
<li>target weights I am supposed to compose</li>
</ul>

<p>There always has to be a weight that = 1, so all the weights can be composed exactly.
I am supposed to print out the optimal composition of weights, for example</p>

<ul>
<li>number of weights: 4</li>
<li>weights: 1, 3, 7, 10</li>
<li>target weight: 4</li>
<li>output: 2 x 7</li>
</ul>

<p>PART 2 <br></p>

<p>The first thing that came to my mind was the unbounded knapsack problem, where I would set all the values for weights to ""1"" and then I'd look for the lowest possible value in the knapsack. The problem is, my programming skills don't reach that level and my googling skills failed me when I wanted to find a fine article/code/video/whatever to understand it.</p>

<p>Then someone pointed out the making-change problem. The problem there is that it usually uses an array and I am expecting really large numbers, I cannot afford to alloc an array of size = target weight. Also, it seems to require quite a lot of magic if I want not only the lowest possible number of weights, but the exact counts.</p>

<p>My solution now, shall I?</p>

<ol>
<li>sort the weights in descending order</li>
<li>count the number of weights yielded from the greedy algorithm</li>
<li>remove one biggest weight used and try to compose the weight without it</li>
<li>repeat 3 until I have removed all the ""biggest weights"" or the number of weights started to grow again</li>
</ol>

<p>(for weights = 1, 3, 7, 10 and target = 14, greedy would give me 1 x 10 + 1 x 3 + 1 x 1, after the third step I would get (0 x 10 +) 2 x 7)</p>

<p>I got here. Only I need to repeat this not outside the recursive function (like I was doing until I realised it still doesn't give me the right results) but I need to move the loop into the recursive function.</p>

<p>PART 3 </p>

<p>This is how parts of my code looks now:</p>

<pre><code> for ( i = 0; i &lt; weights_cnt; i ++ )
    for ( j = 0; j &lt;= weight / *(weights + i); j ++ )
    {
        *counter = 0;
        if ( (res = greedyMagicImproved(weights + i, weight / *(weights + i) - j, weight, counter, min)) == 0 || min &gt; *counter ) break;
        else min = *counter;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>It's a mess, I know. (the first recursive function I've ever written, sorry for that)</p>

<pre><code>int greedyMagicImproved (int * weights, int limit, int weight, int * counter, int min)
{
    if ( *counter &gt; min ) return 0;
    else if ( weight % *weights == 0 )
    {
        printf (""%d * %d\n"", limit, *weights);
        *counter += limit;
        return *counter;
    }
    else if ( weight == 0 ) return *counter;
    else if ( weight / *weights )
    {           
        printf (""%d * %d + "", limit, *weights);
        *counter += limit;
        return (greedyMagicImproved(weights + 1, (weight - *weights * limit) / *(weights + 1), (weight - *weights * limit) % *weights, counter, min));
    }
    else return greedyMagicImproved(weights + 1, weight / *(weights + 1), weight, counter, min);

    }
</code></pre>

<p>This one produces something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Number of weights:
8
Actual weights of weights:
1 2 4 5 10 20 60 95
Weights to be composed:
124
GREEDY = 1 * 95 + 1 * 20 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 4
IMP = 1 * 95 + 1 * 20 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 4
2 * 60 + 1 * 4
6 * 20 + 1 * 4
... some more irrelevant results I'll deal with later
28
GREEDY = 1 * 20 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1
IMP = 1 * 20 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1
1 * 20 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1
1 * 20 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1
2 * 10 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1
5 * 5 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1
... some more results as well
</code></pre>

<p>While I get to see the correct result in the first case, I do not in the second.
So basically, my question is: Should I try to move the loop part into the recursion (and write it basically all over again because I have no idea how to do it) or should I go stealing/packing and making change? </p>

"31762591","1","31802328","","2015-08-01 13:52:01","","0","46","<p>I'm trying to decide upon the best format of response for my API.  I need to return a reports response which provides information on the report itself and the fields contained on it.  Fields can be of differing types, so there can be: SelectList; TextArea; Location etc..</p>

<p>They each use different properties, so ""SelectList"" might use ""Value"" to store its string value and ""Location"" might use ""ChildItems"" to hold ""Longitude"" ""Latitude"" etc.</p>

<p>Here's what I mean:</p>

<pre><code>  ""ReportList"": [
    {
      ""Fields"": [
        {
          ""Id"": {},
          ""Label"": """",
          ""Value"": """",
          ""FieldType"": """",
          ""FieldBankFieldId"": {},
          ""ChildItems"": [
            {
              ""Item"": """",
              ""Value"": """"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The problem</strong> with this is I'm expecting the users to know when a value is supposed to be null.  So I'm expecting a person looking to extract the value from ""Location"" to extract it from ""ChildItems"" and not ""Value"".  The benefit to this however, is it's much easier to query for things than the alternative which is the following:</p>

<pre><code>  ""ReportList"": [
    {
      ""Fields"": [
        {
          ""SelectList"": [
            {
               ""Id"": {},
               ""Label"": """",
               ""Value"": """",
            }
          ]
          ""Location"": [
            {
               ""Id"": {},
               ""Label"": """",
               ""Latitude"": """",
               ""Longitude"": """",
               ""etc"": """",
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So this one is a reports list that contains a list of fields which on it contains a list of fieldtype for every fieldtype I have (15 or something like that).  This is opposed to just having a list of reports which has a list of fields with a ""fieldtype"" enum which I think is fairly easy to manipulate.  </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>So the Question:</strong>  Which format is best for a response?  Any alternatives and comments appreciated.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  </p>

<p>To query all fields by fieldtype in a report and get values with the first way it would go something like this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(field in fields)
{
    switch(field.fieldType){
       case FieldType.Location :
           var locationValue = field.childitems;
           break;
       case FieldType.SelectList:
           var valueselectlist = field.Value;
           break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The second one would be like:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(field in fields)
{
    foreach(location in field.Locations)
    {
        var latitude = location.Latitude;
    }
    foreach(selectList in field.SelectLists)
    {
        var value= selectList.Value;
    }
}  
</code></pre>

<p>I think the right answer is the first one. With the switch statement. It makes it easier to query on for things like: Get me the value of the field with the id of this guid. It just means putting it through a big switch statement.</p>

<p>So I tried to combine the two:</p>

<p>This is for a progress queue.  For one application I don't want two rows with status <code>S</code> (for ""started"").  However other applications should be able to - in particular if I want to force two work items to happen at once, I can. So that's why it's not a database constraint.</p>

I want my webservice to be able to use my internal business layer services. The webservice is to be used by an external client from a different domain and will mainly be used to send and recieve information about entities such as Orders and Customers.</p>

<p>An example would be:</p>

<pre><code> public class MyService : System.Web.Services.WebService
{
    [WebMethod]
    public string HelloWorld()
    {
        return new MyBusinessService().MyMethod();
    } 
}

    public class MyBusinessService : IMyBusinessService
{
    public string MyMethod()
    {
        return ""hello"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to use dependency injection to eliminate the need for ""newing"" up my service but i cant figure out a way to do this. I can get it to work using poor mans DI, or at least i think it's called ""poor mans"".</p>

<p>like this:</p>

<pre><code> public class MyService : System.Web.Services.WebService
{
    private IMyBusinessService _myService;

    public MyService(IMyBusinessService myService)
    {
        _myService = myService;
    }

    public MyService() : this(new MyBusinessServie()) { }

    [WebMethod]
    public string HelloWorld()
    {
        return _myService.MyMethod();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I simply cant get my head around how to use a IoC container to inject my dependencies because i cant get the service to run without  a parameterless constructor. 
Please be kind, i am not an experienced programmer and have just started to test dependency injection and got it to work fine on my windows forms application with structuremap but got stuck on this one.</p>

<p>Html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""content""&gt;
&lt;div class=""container""&gt;

&lt;ul class=""grid""&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=""img/Icon-House.png""&gt;&lt;label&gt;Houses&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.content{
    background-color: #e24840;
    width: 743px;
    height: 300px;

    margin-top: 48px;

    border-radius: 4px; 
    box-shadow: -5px 5px 10px #888888;
}

.content ul {
    float: left;

}

.content li {
    margin: 20px;

    height: 180px;
    border-color: white;
    border-width: 2px;
    border-radius: 4px;
    border-style: solid;
}

.content img{

    display: block;
}

<p>My core requirements would be to ensure that any code/tests run against the correct resources, in particular, database schema and sample data.</p>

<p>I've tried various ways to do this with mixed degrees of success. Currently, I …</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a class library *.Installation.dll, which creates, configures
and populates the database, etc. </li>
<li>Have a class library *.Build.dll
which has an MSBuild task that takes parameters from the csproj file
and passes to the Installation.dll.</li>
</ul>

<p>These sit within their own solution. Say MyApp.Build.sln. I maintain this separately from my main solution, to prevent file locking issues.</p>

<p>In my main solution, say MyApp.sln …</p>

<p>Then, my test projects invoke the MSBuild task to create test environments for integration testing including database and sample test data.
And my Web/Windows front end projects invoke the MSBuild to create runnable environments for test users/my manual testing</p>

<p>So, I am using MSBuild to create customisable builds/environments for testing/running. Additionally, I can wrap the Installation.dll into a configuration/setup tool to automate the installation for the user when the time comes to install.</p>

<p>Is this too complex a scenario? I'm worried I've over engineered this and overlooked something. It works well, but is bound by a lot of meta programming (eg. the database build code, configuration, build task, etc.) that is not directly involved with tangible, chargeable work.</p>

<p>I have SubVersion and TeamCity. I'd like to enable a CI build ultimately that is invokes on a daily/commit build trigger. Or can I use TeamCity in such a way to avoid rebuilding the database/etc. every build?</p>

<p>Thanks for any insight.</p>

<p>This works. What I'd like to know is this ok? Are there issues to look out for? This is my first time trying this so there are a lot of unknowns for me. I understand that both cmd, and gtk are blocking. The Gtk.main, and cmd loops work flawlessly so far. I'm just being cautious.</p>

<p>My first time using threading too. When cmd gets the command to setbutton the button is set. When the button is clicked 'something happened' prints. The  command line continues as if nothing out of the ordinary happened. I was really surprised at how seamless it all works. Yet I am still a little worried.</p>

<p>I want to inherit properties from my parent class to my child class. Please pay attention to the child class. My problem is, in the way that my code is written; </p>

<p>-When I want to call the child class in my mainwindow behind code, I cannot assign values to all of the inhereted properties of the child class, it only allows me to assing values to the new properties that are in the child class as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>Dim ChildClass As New ChildClass(var5, var6)'&lt;---Unable to assing values to the rest of the inherited properties

<p>-Also within the child class I am unable to assing fields to the inhereted properties, and there you will see this weird </p>

<pre><code>MyBase.New(1, 1, 1, 1) 
</code></pre>

<p>which basically prevents me from controlling the values of the inhereted properties.</p>

<p>However as you can see at the mainwindow behind code I am able to read and use all 6 properties of the child class(inhereted and new ones),but with the not desirable values for the inhereted ones.</p>

<p><strong>What I would like is to be able to assing values to all the 6 properties when I am calling the child class from my mainwindow behind code.</strong></p>

To do this I am using two images one which is a circle divided up into sections to represent the angle the ball was struck at. The other image is just a putter head that is rotated to represent the angle which the club hits the ball at. This image sits on top of the circle image. The blue ellipse represents the position of the ball.See the image output got from my application in the link below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/5lvd5xfhm0hyklf/FaceAngle.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">Required application output</a></p>

<p>To do this I basically calculated the width and height of the grid using this code:</p>

<pre><code>    public FacePage()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        GridGraphs.SizeChanged += GridGraphs_SizeChanged;
    }

    void GridGraphs_SizeChanged(object sender, SizeChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        GetMeasurements();
    }

    private void GetMeasurements()
    {

        GridGraphs.Measure(new Size(double.PositiveInfinity, double.PositiveInfinity));

        double width = GridGraphs.DesiredSize.Width;
        double height = GridGraphs.DesiredSize.Height;

        RotatePutter(width,height);

    }
</code></pre>

<p>and then passed the width and height into RotatePutter() where the the width and height was divided by two to get the centre point of the grid see below:</p>

<pre><code>    public void RotatePutter(double width, double height)
    {

        double radius = width*0.5;
        double centerX = width*0.5;
        double centerY = height*0.5;

        Random ran = new Random();
        double angle = ran.Next(-15, 15);

        if (angle &gt;= 0)
        {

            else

        double angleradians = (angle * (Math.PI / 180));

        imgPutter.RenderTransform = rt;


        BallLocation(radius, angleradians, centerX, centerY);

    }
</code></pre>

<p>The centre point,radius,angle and the putter Image is rotated here and the radius, angleradians,centerX and centerY are passed to BallLocation to calculate the position of the Ball like so:</p>

<pre><code>  public void BallLocation(double rad, double anglerad, double centerX, double centerY)
    {

        Ellipse ellipse = new Ellipse();


        double xBallPoint = (centerX - (rad * Math.Cos(anglerad)));
        double yBallPoint = (centerY - (rad * Math.Sin(anglerad)));

        ellipse.Height = 10;
        ellipse.Width = 10;
        ellipse.Fill = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Aqua);

       Canvas.SetLeft(ellipse, xBallPoint);
       Canvas.SetTop(ellipse, yBallPoint);
       canvasFaceAngle.Children.Add(ellipse);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This works ok in full screen put once I change the size of the window the position of the ball for the angle it was hit at is all wrong.</p>

<p>Would anyone have any idea how to dynamically get the grid width and height as the window size changes so to calculate the correct position for the ellipse (ball). Or any other alternative ways of completing this is also welcomed. Thanks in advance.</p>

The connection is just a short SQL script which grabs the data to be shown on the report. The data is populated into a table (not a pivot table).</p>

<p>Every week we need to update these reports, so I use a simple PowerShell script to open each of the files and refresh the connection.</p>

<p>Every so often we need to send the base 30 reports to other work groups so they can manually update the files on their own. This can be a nuisance because some of the reports are very large (30mb+). This makes emailing difficult, and uploading them/downloading them several times a day is just a hassle.</p>

<p>To mitigate this, before we distribute the report templates I try to delete all the rows in the tables, and any unused range. This has helped, but there's still several files that are VERY large (30mb+) even though we've deleted everything in the workbook except the connection, and the empty table.</p>

<p>Through tests, I've realized that if I delete the configured connection, the file size becomes sufficiently small (&lt;1mb) which is what I would expect. This leads me to believe that Excel connections have a sort of cache that needs to be cleared, however I can't find any references for this.</p>

<p>Does anyone know a simple way for reducing the size of a connection in such a way that I could do so programmatically using VBA/Powershell?</p>

<p>If any of these have a value, I want to add it to an SQL query, if it doesnt, I ignore it.
Further, if one has a value it needs to be added as an <code>AND</code> and any subsequent ones need to be an <code>OR</code> (but there is no way of telling which is going to be the first to have a value!)</p>

<p>Ive used the following snippet to check on the first value and append the query as needed, but I dont want to copy-and-paste this 9 times; one for each of the items in the array.</p>

<pre><code>$i = 0;
if (isset($_GET['tod_house'])){

<p>Is there a way to loop through the array changing the names so I only have to use this code once (please note that $_GET['tod_house'] on the first line and tod_house on the last line are not the same thing! - the first is the name of the checkbox that passes the value, and the second one is just a string to add to the query)</p>

<hr>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>The answer is based heavily upon the accepted answer, but I will show exactly what worked in case anyone else stumbles across this question....</p>

<p>I didnt want the answer to be as suggested:</p>

<pre><code>tod_bung = 1 AND (tod_barnc = 1 OR tod_small = 1)
</code></pre>

<p>rather I wanted it like:</p>

<pre><code>AND (tod_bung = 1 OR tod_barnc = 1 OR tod_small = 1)
</code></pre>

<p>so it could be appended to an existing query. Therefore his answer has been altered to the following:</p>

<pre><code>$qOR = array();
foreach ($list as $var) {
    if (isset($_GET[$var])) {
            $qOR[] = ""$var = 1"";
    }
}
$qOR = implode(' OR ', $qOR);
$query .= "" AND ("" .$qOR . "")"";
</code></pre>

<p>IE there is no need for two different arrays - just loop through as he suggests, if the value is set add it to the new qOR array, then implode with OR statements, surround with parenthesis, and append to the original query. </p>

<p>The only slight issue with this is that if only one item is set, the query looks like:</p>

<pre><code>AND (tod_bung = 1)
</code></pre>

<p>There are parenthesis but no OR statements inside. Strictly speaking they arent needed, but im sure it wont alter the workings of it so no worries!!</p>

The solution that I performed is the following:</p>

<pre><code>% Transform the second image using the estimated homography
T = maketform('projective', inv(H));
[~, xdata, ydata] = imtransform(im2, T);

% Compute bounds for stitched image
xdataout = [min(1, xdata(1)) max(size(im1, 2), xdata(2))];
ydataout = [min(1, ydata(1)) max(size(im1, 1), ydata(2))];
% Transform both images with the computed xdata and ydata
im2t = imtransform(im2, T, 'XData', xdataout, 'YData', ydataout);
T2 = maketform('affine', eye(3));
im1t = imtransform(im1, T2,'XData', xdataout, 'YData', ydataout);

% Merge the two images 
result = max(im1t, im2t); 
figure, imshow(result)
</code></pre>

<p>However in this way I am placing in the foreground the image with higher luminance. I have instead to put in the foreground the reference image (im1).
I have tried as follows:</p>

<pre><code>result = im1t; 
result(result == 0) = im2t(result == 0);
</code></pre>

<p>but in this way an artifact appears in the top border of im1t (there appears a sort of black border). I suppose that this is due to the affine transformation that I performed in order to register the two images. 
Thanks in advance</p>

<p>edit:
I finally solved the issues using 'FillValues', NaN as parameter in imtransform</p>

<p>It works fine in firefox, but in IE7 the parent div is stretching with the child div. Is there anyway to stop IE7 from stretching the parent div? For some design constraints the divs cannot be positioned. I tried to search for it on the internet but couldn't find any solution! Thanks in advance for your time!</p>

<br/><br/>
The first is, obviously to simulate one dice we need to randomly generate a number from 1-6. The book suggests this:</p>

<pre><code>int       RollOne( void ) {
    return (rand() % 6) + 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Right, well rand() can generate any number from 0-32767. We then find the remainder of this number when it's divided by 6, then add 1. E.g. 3245 is randomly generated. We divide it by 6, giving 540.8333 and take the remainder. 8.333 (truncated to 8 I believe) and then add 1. Unless I'm going mad, that makes 9, which is not between 1-6. The program runs fine however and I just can't understand how we get a number from 1-6 using that code! Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The second problem I have isn't really as major, but is relevant. The book left out what this bit of code means:</p>

<pre><code>srand( clock() );
</code></pre>

<p>All that is mentioned is that srand() initialises a random number generator using the seed provided by clock(). Right, now can we actually input anything into clock(), if so what is its effect? Just a little explanation of what srand( clock() ) does would be perfect.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long post, I hope you don't mind the wall'o'text. Any help would be really appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Mike</p>

<p><b>ANSWERED</b>
Thank you everyone: I realise what I was doing. As shown by you guys, the % operator doesn't divide, it just finds the difference between the highest multiple and the operand. Got it! I was under the impression that the remainder meant the decimal. I.e. If 7/2 = 3.5 then the remainder is 0.5. Now that I've written it out, I see how stupid I've been. Glad my A-level maths counts for something.....<br/>
Thanks again!</p>

"18011328","1","","","2013-08-02 07:36:42","","0","585","<p>In the process of porting Xamarin.Auth to Windows 8 I came across the following problem. When trying to authenticate to LinkedIn using OAuth2 and Requesting an Access Token by exchanging the authorization code for it <a href=""https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/authentication"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/authentication</a>, Xamarin.Auth tries to parse the result (A JSON object) as if it were a url formatted string. In RequestAccessTokenAsync (OAuth2Authenticator.cs) there is the following code</p>

<pre><code>var text = task1.Result.GetResponseText(); [JSON object]

var data = WebEx.FormDecode(text);
</code></pre>

<p>Am I missing something? Is this a bug in the Xamarin.Auth code? Do all OAuth2 based websites return JSON objects in this scenario, and if not how would one determine the type of format the result is in, other than trying to look for indicators in the result itself?</p>

<h1>Update:</h1>

<p>I edited the GetResponseText extension to return the type of content, in this case application/json and used Json.Net to parse the Json as the GetValueFromJson function in the framework does not work for the json returned in this scenario. </p>

<p>After working with this framework for a couple of days, it seems to be a ""Beta"" version, I will have to extensively modify it in order for it to be portable across Win8, WP8, iOS and Android. </p>

<p>e.g. Expect100Continue not supported in W8, will have to remove HttpWebRequest and replace with HttpClient. </p>

<p>e.g. LinkedIn requires a header to be set in order to return Json, these kinds of option need to be made available to the caller of the framework. </p>

<p>e.g. ContentType parsing needs to be completed as per the relevant specifications.</p>

<p>I am currently debating the most efficient way to implement table wise. My understanding is that its not possible or efficient in MySQL to have a table with subtables to accomplish something like a single table for each user (This doesnt seem efficient either) with the needed columns for uservars and a subtable for comments on the user page (The UG profile has an example). The same question arises for the photo database is it better to have one with ALL photos with their properties as well as the posted comments, or to have a seperate table for each photo.</p>

  Waiting threads are added to the wait set and parked whereas threads
  attempting to take the monitor are added to the entry set and then
  parked. On notify a thread is taken from the wait set and added to the
  entry set. When a thread releases the lock it unparks a thread from
  the entry set if there is one. Note that these sets are actually
  implemented as queues (linked lists) so are treated on a FIFO basis.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I know about ARC, strong &amp; weak references... In non ARC-code, in <code>showSelfInView</code>: I'd retain the view controller, and I would autorelease it in <code>buttonTapped</code>.</p>

<p>That's an ok way to achieve that, to me. And I would like to know if I'm missing something with ARC, or with the way I use my view/viewController. Since the view is still visible, to me, its viewController shouldn't get dealloc-ed. Is there any way to prevent that, besides of creating my own strong reference to the view controller?</p>

<p><strong>REPHRASED</strong></p>

<p>Is there any non-patchy non-dirty way to have a view controller remains allocated until its view gets removed from display. I consider any pointer from view controller to itself as dirty, though that's the way I'm currently using.</p>

I also worry that I will be giving up too much control over the database and make it harder to track down any data level problems.

<p>So far I have come up with 2 solutions:</p>

<p><strong>Multiple queries to the DB</strong></p>

<p>I have been able to implement a successful solution that will iterate through the database and decrease a date object by 1 which is then used as a string to match the date. The issue is that the database may need to be queried 100 times before it finds the earliest date. Is it bad practice to do it this way?</p>

<p><strong>Iterative through the result set</strong></p>

<p>Another possibility is to iterate through a result set of all the flashcards in the table. However, this would involve 2 loops, one to iterate over each row in the table which would be inside a loop that would decrease the date by 1.</p>

<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/FoWsVYA.png"" rel=""nofollow"">This</a> is my storyboard set up. The third view controller is the one I'm trying to present.</p>

<p>1: This results in black screen.</p>

self.presentViewController(searchController, animated: true, completion: nil)

<p>2: This results in a white, empty view controller popping up.</p>

let searchController : UIViewController = mainStoryboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier(""searchController"") as! UIViewController
self.presentViewController(searchController, animated: true, completion: nil)

<p>Here is the code for the actual view controller:</p>

<pre><code>class SearchController: UIViewController {

    lazy var searchBar: UISearchBar = UISearchBar(frame: CGRectMake(0, 0, 200, 20))

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        var leftItem = (UIBarButtonItem)(customView: searchBar)

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
