<p>We're using 2 ways to publish our banners. One is with google doubleclick and the other one is direct publishing on websites.</p>

<p>We got no problem with doubleklick, because they say, that the initial load should be under 100kb and the rest could be loaded after that.</p>

<p>But the publishers for the direct publishing are saying, that the whole banner (all files which are used and compressed as a zip) should be max. 100kb.</p>

<p>You have a duck class and several types of ducks. You have to code in the flying and quacking behaviors of the ducks. You obviously cannot code in the flying, non-flying behaviors in each of the duck class methods especially if you have like a 100 different kind of ducks. So you create a behavior interface called <code>FlyingBehavior</code> and <code>QuackingBehavior</code> and have implementations like <code>NonFlyingBehavior</code> or <code>FlyWithWingsBehavior</code> or <code>MuteQuackBehavior</code> or <code>SqueakQuackBehavior</code>. Then set these in a field in the different classes of duck. That way you associate the behaviors with the ducks. </p>

<p>What I don't understand is why it has to be done with a composition and why not with inheritance. Why can't you create subclasses lke <code>NonFlyingDuck</code>, <code>FlyWithWingsDuck</code> or <code>SqueakingDuck</code>, <code>MuteQuackingDuck</code> and so on, and then implement the methods <code>fly()</code> or <code>quack()</code> and then assign appropriate behavior to the ducks. Is this because multiple inheritance is not supported. so if you have a non-flying, squeaking duck then you cannot extend both <code>squeakingDuck</code> and <code>NonFlyingDuck</code> or is it something else. Is there some way of doing this with inheritance?</p>

<p>I feel a bit confused. The motto is <em>'favor composition over inheritance'</em>. Why though?</p>

<p>Can someone explain this in depth?</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/P1NmI.png"" alt=""It's some Photoshop settings!"" title=""It's an image WITH FREEHAND CIRCLES!!! OMG WTF BBQ!!!!!""></p>

<p>I have full access to our debian-linus-based servers, so any GD or ImageMagick solution will work. As will any FOSS linux software solution, although I'd prefer a way to do it with IM or GD as those are already installed and don't require new software to be installed.</p>

<p><strong>The shadow must be able to be placed on a transparent, non-rectangular PNG!</strong></p>

<p>I'm asking the question mainly because the scripts and solutions I have found on the web either only produce rectangular shadows, look like total poo, or just plain don't work at all.</p>

It initially populates fine from the object, and a populated dropdown appears when I edit the cell, but a selected value does not get back into the cell when I leave focus.</p>

<p>Here's my model and domain objects:</p>

<pre><code> public class ModelBase : INotifyPropertyChanged
 {
   public IList&lt;Person&gt; Persons { get; set; }
 }

 public class UserControlModel : ModelBase
 {
    public ObservableCollection&lt;DatagridRecord&gt; SourceData { get; set; }
 }

 public class Person
 {
   public int Id { get; set; }
   public string Name { get; set; }
 }

 public class DatagridRecord
 {
   public string Name { get; set; }
   public Person ContactPerson { get; set; }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>And in my xaml.cs, I set the DataContext via a Model property:</p>

<pre><code> public UserControlModel _model;
 public UserControlModel Model
 {
  set
  {
    _model = value;
    DataContext = null;
    DataContext = _model;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's my DataGrid column definition in xaml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;DataGridTemplateColumn Header=""Person"" &gt;
     &lt;DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;
      &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding Path=ContactPerson.Name}""/&gt;&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
      &lt;/DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;
      &lt;DataGridTemplateColumn.CellEditingTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
          &lt;ComboBox ItemsSource=""{Binding Path=DataContext.Persons, 
                       RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type uch:ControlBase}}}"" 
                       DisplayMemberPath=""Name"" 
                       SelectedValuePath=""Id"" /&gt;
        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
   &lt;/DataGridTemplateColumn.CellEditingTemplate&gt;
 &lt;/DataGridTemplateColumn&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I figure there is something wrong with tying the combobox selected value to the grid row, but I've gone around in circles trying to hook it up.  Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

<p>When I deploy a .NET build into Windows Azure into a web role (or service role) it takes usually 6-15 minute for it to startup.  In AWS's EC2 it takes about the same to startup the image and then a minute or two to deploy the app to IIS (pending of course its setup).</p>

<p>However when I boot up an AWS instance with SUSE Linux &amp; Mono to run .NET, I get one of these booted and deploy code to it in about 2-3 minutes (again, pending it is setup).</p>

<p>What is going on with Windows OS images that cause them to take soooo long to boot up in the cloud?  I don't want FUD, I'm curious about the specific details of what goes on that causes this.  Any specific technical information regarding this would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.</p>

<p>The value gets updated and it is been shown correctly when i do the results.dumpToString(). But when i continue again in the loop and come back again ,the value is not updated.Is it because i am doing the commit incorrectly.My issue is even if the value is getting updated inside the recursive function after that the changes are not getting reflected.Is there a way of AUTOCOMMIT in neo4j.</p>

Namely how to revert a repository back to a good state if I do something wrong.  I have seen how to use 'git revert' to make changes that undo previous changes, and I have read quite a few of the questions on stackoverflow and related locations, but I haven't found a simple way to simply say ""put my local repository bits back to exactly what they were before I did X"" where X may be a commit, merge, or other repository operation.</p>

<p>Long Story:</p>

<p>This bit me particularly hard today when I was trying to setup a subtree branch for a third-party dependency (Jasmine) following the steps in the ProGit book on <a href=""http://progit.org/book/ch6-7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Subtree Merging</a>.  I followed the steps and setup a local repository with a branch that tracked a remote Jasmine repository.  Then I connected this up using read-tree to a subdirectory in my probject and all was good.  Unfortunately the Jasmine branch contained a submodule reference to a non-public URL and when I tried to fix this up I made the changes (and commits) on the branch I had tracking the remote repository.  No matter what I did to try to revert these commits/changes, my 'git push' commands couldn't work anymore because the repository thought I had changes to the Jasmine code and was trying to push them back through the public URL I was tracking.</p>

<p>Summary: I screwed up part of my respository and could not figure out how to get it back in the pristine condition it was in before I issued the commands caused by my git newbie status.</p>

<p>Is there anyway to rollback the entire repository a few commits/changes or do I just have to clone it again and start over when this happens?</p>

<p>This works fine on Android 2.3, but not on 4.x. I am using ActionBarSherlock 4.3.1, in this case in a viewPager activity. Is this a known issue?</p>

<p>(Currently I have a workaround where I use the default android SearchView in 4.x.)</p>

<p>Honestly I'm not good that WCF at all, so I just tried ways randomly. I can get messages from server with string and byte[] and so on, but when i wanted to upload large data eg. image or audio, the uploaded message which includes big byte[] must be limited under 8192bytes. That causes my uploading into failure.</p>

<p>Now what I can do is to convert the big byte[] into Base64String and split it into 8000bytes pieces, and execute a bunch of commands like UploadAsyn(orderNumber, uploadStringBlock), and reform them up again in server with the orderNumber. and convert back to bytes from Base64string. Very busy and silly!</p>

<p>Otherwise I must think other way to solve large file uploading from mobile phone.</p>

<p>And it's really a big pity and problem not to make all actions achieved totally inside WCF coding.</p>

<p>Hope Mono improve it. and if any help welcome and appreciated.</p>

"10079377","1","","","2012-04-09 20:25:58","","0","273","<p>I am working on a project that involves the creation of a dll that honours a certain interface in order to plug into some software in order to add functionality to it.  This is done by a dll that calls my dll (I do not have the source code for the dll that does the calling).  Originally I was given an interface and a C# implementation that created a COM visible dll.  However after using this for a while I found I wanted to make use of some large C++ libraries and as creating wrappers would take a long time I thought about creating a C++ ATL COM dll instead.  I did this and the methods of my class appear to be called correctly (I register my dll, run the program and the methods appear to be called in the correct order), however I have found some of the behavior to be different.</p>

<p>I am not sure how to go about explaining this as my code relates to a closed source API but perhaps if I describe an example someone might have some ideas as to where I might want look.</p>

<p>For instance, in the C# dll I attempt to open a file by doing this:</p>

<pre><code>FMANFileControl fileControl = new FMANFileControl();
FMANFile wFile = null;
const string filePath = @""C:\Data\April 4\Data_IDA.wiff"";
wFile = fileControl.GetFileObject(filePath, 1);
long numSamples = wFile.GetNumberOfSamples();
</code></pre>

<p>I get the correct number of samples.</p>

<p>In my C++ dll I have this (with some of the HRESULT checks removed in order to keep the code shorter):</p>

<pre><code>std::string filePath = ""C:\\Data\\April 4\\Data_IDA.wiff"";
_bstr_t fileName(filePath.c_str());
IFMANFilePtr ipFMANFile;
IFMANFileControlPtr ipFMANFileControl;
hr = ipFMANFileControl.CreateInstance(__uuidof(FMANFileControl));
hr = ipFMANFile.CreateInstance(__uuidof(FMANFile));
ipFMANFile = ipFMANFileControl-&gt;GetFileObject(fileName, 1);
long numSamples = ipFMANFile-&gt;GetNumberOfSamples(); 
</code></pre>

<p>but the files does not open correctly, resulting is zero samples.</p>

<p>Using oleview I looked at the typelib and it says this for the function: </p>

<pre><code>[id(0x00000001), helpstring(""method GetWiffFileObject"")] 
IFMANWiffFile* GetWiffFileObject( [in] BSTR WiffFileName, [in] long sample); 
</code></pre>

<p>The file I get information from is one that is being written to during an experiment and just before it obtains more data it calls my method and I should be able to obtain the newest file.  In the C# dll this is possible, but in the C++ dll this is not.  While I realize the specifics of this is hidden, I am wondering is anyone has any idea why a C++ COM dll and a C#, comvisible dll that make use of the same interface would exhibit different behavour when being called by the same dll.</p>

<p>I am pretty stumped at this moment so any ideas at all would be appreciated, even if they turn out to be way off base.  I can share my source code if anyone thinks they might be able to help.</p>

<p>EDIT:
I tried the solution to answer 1, however I could not compile my code.  When reading about this I found this post:
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1575818/differences-between-in-out-and-out-retval-in-com-idl-definitions"">Differences between [in, out] and [out, retval] in COM IDL definitions</a>
that seems to suggest that since the FMANFile pointer is marked [out, retval] that the method becomes:</p>

<pre><code>IFMANFilePtr ExploreData::IFMANFileControl(BSTR filename, long sample);
</code></pre>

<p>or am I misinterpreting that article?</p>

<p>EDIT 2:
Got it working though I am not really sure why.
Originally I had the variables declared in the header as private member variables of the class, like this:</p>

<pre><code>class ATL_NO_VTABLE CUserIDA :
public CComObjectRootEx&lt;CComSingleThreadModel&gt;,
public CComCoClass&lt;CUserIDA, &amp;CLSID_UserIDAObject&gt;,
public IUserIDA
{
.
.
.
public:
STDMETHOD(GetSwitchCriteria)(DOUBLE* intensity, DOUBLE* minMass, DOUBLE* maxMass, VARIANT_BOOL *selectIntensity, LONG* numOfDepCycles);
    .
    .
    .
private:
    ExploreDataObjects::IFMANWiffFilePtr ipFMANWiffFile;
ExploreDataObjects::IFMANWiffFile2Ptr ipFMANWiffFile2;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Just to try it I moved them to the top of the class delcaration like this:</p>

<pre><code>class ATL_NO_VTABLE CUserIDA :
public CComObjectRootEx&lt;CComSingleThreadModel&gt;,
public CComCoClass&lt;CUserIDA, &amp;CLSID_UserIDAObject&gt;,
public IUserIDA
{

ExploreDataObjects::IFMANWiffFilePtr ipFMANWiffFile;
ExploreDataObjects::IFMANWiffFile2Ptr ipFMANWiffFile2;
</code></pre>

<p>I thought that by default these would also be private members and the same as before so I am at a loss to explain why this seemed to work.  Can someone explain this?</p>

<p>end of my code
here's a problem with</p>

<pre><code>if(genome.find(""ATG"",0) == npos)
</code></pre>

<p>it calls npos a undiclared identifyer I think. I thought npos was what find would return if it didn't find ATG</p>

<p>theres a problem with this which I find strange since it worked when I didn't put it into variable currentGene but just used cout for this substring</p>

<pre><code>string currentGene = genome.substr(startGene + 3, endGene - (startGene +3)) &lt;&lt;endl;

But it's a big bunch of data. So I'm afraid about efficient(not so much) and size of the app itself. What's the best way to use these photos in my iOS app? Does it make sense to create New Image Set and create 1x,2x and 3x photos for each photo or do I have to use other features I don't now about?</p>

The app is about sights. From the tableview user can chose any sight and will be shown screen with 1-3 photos( in CollectionView if there's more than 1 photo) and some text. All data(except photos) I'm getting from sqlite db using CoreData.</p>

<p>The photos are shown on the screen have width equal to screen width (the height 25:38 from width). Width is bigger:)</p>

<ol>
<li>I want to use big resolution photos because I want show full-size
photos by tap.  </li>
<li>Each photo can be 2000px or more on the biggest
side.   </li>
<li>The app is an offline app so I want to store photos in the
app. I now just about image assets. But are there other ways to
store photos?</li>
</ol>

<p>I have an idea to store them in high-resolution and resize to any device(3x, 2x, 1x) to display on the screen. And load high-resolution version of a photo just when user taps on it to show the photo on the full screen.</p>

<p>so the navigation is there...and when I click on the top one, the others slide down so you can see the sub categories for the one I clicked.</p>

<p>however if I click any of the others nothing happens.</p>

<p>has anyone had this problem before or know how to solve it looking at my code?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Scenario : When there is any need of shopping, the customer will contact us via mobile phone and we'll use their fingerprint ( which is already scanned via the application mentioned above) to login into that shopping software.</p>

<p>so when login needed the application will give <strong>virtual biometric fingerprint</strong> output to the shopping software and thus login can be done. further, the shopping software will send message to customer; customer will give the code via call and we'll be able to login into their account and will shop for them.</p>

My problem is that I can't seem to figure out the PHP exec command to get this accomplished. </p>

<p>I've tried five different formats suggested by multiple threads on StackOverflow, and none see to pass back a result, and nearly half of them freeze the browser with no output pipe. </p>

<p>I don't understand how to do ARGs nor the method of which order execution parameters go inside the exec() command. Here are my variables:</p>

<pre><code>$filename = ""/home/me/serverside_scripts/myScript.php"";
$options = ""value=999""; // I've also tried the Array('value' =&gt; 99) to avail

<p>myScript is returning a JSON string that needs to be decoded, so all I want back is a STRING, or an array with a [0] equaling a string. </p>

<p>What do the > &amp;&amp; 2>&amp;1 mean?</p>

<p>The reason I'm using the exec() is to test the results, because this script will be executed by Java scripts (NOT JavaScript) as well. </p>

It will do this forever until I manually close the test runner and Chrome process. Here is the selenium log:</p>

Also, if you know any other possible solution that doens't include Gecko, feel free to discuss.</p>

<p>In some literature, it sounds like GAE ""auto-scales"" your app and dynamically calculates the number of Instances you need in order to handle the current server load. However the article above concerns itself primarily with creating and managing Instances manually via the Admin Console.</p>

<p>How are these two concepts related/different?</p>

<p>I ask because I've read the same consistent advice over and over again: <em>try to keep the number of Instances you have running at all times as low as possible (since less Instances results with being billed less).</em> But I'm not sure if this is a manual ""pruning"" job that requires me to be logging into my Admin Console every 10 minutes to see if new Instances need to be created or existing ones destroyed/shutdown; or if this is something that is auto-calculated.</p>

<p>If it is auto-calculated, then what is the point of CRUDing Instances manually via the Admin Console? Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>How do I parse a value that's coming in like this:</p>

<pre><code>2015-06-19 07:32:40 -0500
</code></pre>

<p>Such that using <code>strftime('%Z')</code> will give me the US abbreviation for the timezone?  Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Time.parse(""2015-06-19 07:32:40 -0500"").strftime(""%Y %Z"")
&gt;&gt; 2015 CDT
</code></pre>

<p>The above does NOT happen right now.</p>

<p>I'm beginning to think it can't be done, because <code>-0500</code> has different abbreviations in different parts of the world.</p>

<p><strong>SOME DETAILS:</strong></p>

<p>I'm using Ruby 2.2.2. I cannot for the life of me get a string in this format: <code>2015-06-19 07:32:40 -0500</code> to be parsed correctly by any manner of <code>Time</code> or <code>DateTime</code> object in ruby, while returning the timezone when requested.</p>

<p>What I need to be able to do is parse the string as a <code>DateTime</code> (or similar) and then later output that datetime as a string including the timezone's abbreviation.  Here are some of my attempts:</p>

<p>This is the value that needs to be parsed into a timezone, it is received by the function as a string (as shown by the result here), which cannot be changed.</p>

<pre><code>?&gt; time_string = obj.created_at.to_s
=&gt; ""2015-06-19 07:32:40 -0500""
</code></pre>

<p>-0500 is CDT. <code>Time.parse</code> has the right offset in it's result... but for some reason <code>strftime</code> doesn't display any timezone information at all...</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; Time.parse(time_string)
=&gt; 2015-06-19 07:32:40 -0500
&gt;&gt; Time.parse(time_string).strftime(""%Y %Z"")
=&gt; ""2015 ""
</code></pre>

<p>DateTime also has the correct offset, but %Z, which should be the timezone abbreviation, returns the offset verbatim... ugh.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; DateTime.parse(time_string)
=&gt; Fri, 19 Jun 2015 07:32:40 -0500
&gt;&gt; DateTime.parse(time_string).strftime(""%Y %Z"")
=&gt; ""2015 -05:00""
</code></pre>

<p>Chronic is a time parsing library for ruby which helps with some of the headaches of parsing different formats of strings... however, it takes the string and converts whatever timezone it had into the system timezone. <code>strftime</code> is working correctly, but chronic has already changed the timezone of the result to something undesirable.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; Chronic.parse(time_string)
=&gt; Fri, 19 Jun 2015 06:32:40 MDT -06:00
&gt;&gt; Chronic.parse(time_string).strftime(""%Y %Z"")
=&gt; ""2015 MDT""
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that I can't just change the timezone setting because every time this parses a time string it might have a different offset in it, and I want <em>that</em> offset to be used as the printed timezone.</p>

<p>Is there a way to parse the string so that the offset is preserved, and also shown when using <code>strftime('%Z')</code>? A <code>Chronic</code> solution would be ideal, but I'll take anything at this point.</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>A couple more strange finds. <code>Time.parse</code> <em>only</em> works if the offset is in the current system timezone:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; Time.parse(""2015-06-19 06:32:40 -0600"")
=&gt; 2015-06-19 06:32:40 -0600
&gt;&gt; Time.parse(""2015-06-19 05:32:40 -0700"")
=&gt; 2015-06-19 05:32:40 -0700
?&gt; Time.parse(""2015-06-19 06:32:40 -0600"").strftime(""%Y %Z"")
=&gt; ""2015 MDT""
&gt;&gt; Time.parse(""2015-06-19 05:32:40 -0700"").strftime(""%Y %Z"")

<p>I have a page in my app that displays the list of users along with their images etc. So what I did was that I rendered a partial for every user and that is how it worked.</p>

<p>After refactoring with presenters I've got the same one partial but all logic is moved outside to the presenter, and the view just displays the values, however I noticed that rendering the partial for each user takes as twice as much as it did before.</p>

<p>This is before (data from logs):</p>

<pre><code>Rendered users/_user_thumb.html.haml (6.4ms)
</code></pre>

<p>After refactoring :</p>

<pre><code>Rendered users/_user_thumb.html.haml (18.5ms)
</code></pre>

<p>I've looked at the logs are there some extra queries that get trigger or something, and there is no extra queries fired when the code was refactored.</p>

<p>My question is why is it so slow? Am I doing something wrong? </p>

<p>Here is how my code looks now :</p>

<pre><code> - @users.each do |user|
   = render_partial ""user_thumb"", user: user
</code></pre>

<p>Now inside the render partial <code>user_thumb</code> I had a complex logic, but now I have this :</p>

<pre><code>- present user do |user_presenter|
  ....mycode here
</code></pre>

<p>I use haml.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Billy had some good points in his answer so I voted up his answer.</p>

<p>I tried his suggestion to decorate the <code>@users</code> in the controller like :</p>

<pre><code>@users = UserDecorator.decorate(users)
</code></pre>

<p>And then I then I try to inspect it and I see something like :</p>

<pre><code>#&lt;UserDecorator:0x0000000966a6f8 @object=[#&lt;User id: 8112 .....some users ], @context={}&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which was good cause I seem to get my users decorated at once. Then I tried the suggestion from Billy and did :</p>

<pre><code>= render partial: ""user_thumb"", collection: @users
</code></pre>

<p>But then when I tried in my view :</p>

<pre><code>collection.each do |u|
  puts ""#{user.inspect}""
end
</code></pre>

<p>My decorator looks like :</p>

<pre><code>class UserDecorator &lt; Draper::Decorator
  decorates :user
  ....
end
</code></pre>

<p>I get the user instead of decorated user why is that? How does this work when decorating a list of objects? What is the purpose of that if at the end you still get the user objects?</p>

<p>This works but it's really slower :</p>

<pre><code>- @users.each do |user|
       = render_partial ""user_thumb"", user: user.decorate
</code></pre>

<p>How does one create array of decorators?</p>

We auto start this web app using a <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/09/15/auto-start-asp-net-applications-vs-2010-and-net-4-0-series.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">serviceAutoStartProvider</a>.</p>

<p>Everyhing works when IIS initially starts up, the server is rebooted and so on, we receive messages just fine. <em>BUT</em> if we just stop the site in IIS (not touching the application or app pool), the application stops receiving MSMQ messages. And when we start the web site again, the serviceAutoStartProvider is not called again, so our app does not start listening to MSMQ messages again!</p>

<p>If we issue a HTTP request against the web app after the IIS site has been stopped and started again, it starts listening to MSMQ messages again.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Shouldn't our ""background service"" web app continue to listen to MSMQ messages even if the IIS site is stopped? It won't get any requests, but I think it should continue to run.</p></li>
<li><p>What exactly happens in an Asp.Net application/app pool when the IIS site is stopped? Any events fired that we can hook up to? The app pool claims to be ""started"" in IIS manager, but code is not running in it.</p></li>
<li><p>Why isn't our serviceAutoStartProvider called when the site is started again? I believe it is ""by design"", since the application isn't really stopped. But the applications isn't running, either, has to be waken up by an actual HTTP request.</p></li>

<p>My problem is that when I load the file is like the page was already load and the validation form doesn't take any effect... if I use php include or require_once it works like a charm, the problem is that there are many pages which are Html based that I don't want to turn the whole site to PHP.</p>

<p>The basic: I got a Html page called whatever.html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div class=""container"" &gt;

&lt;div id=""footer_holder""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- /.container --&gt; 

&lt;!-- jQuery and all JS --&gt; 
&lt;script src=""js/jquery.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;... 

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>at the end I'm including a footer which contain 2 Modals:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- Request Modal --&gt;

&lt;div class=""modal fade"" id=""requestModal"" tabindex=""-1"" role=""dialog"" aria-labelledby=""myModalLabel"" aria-hidden=""true""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""modal-dialog""&gt;

        &lt;h4 class=""modal-title"" id=""myModalLabel""&gt;Solicita el Servicio&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=""modal-body""&gt;
      &lt;form role=""form"" id=""requestModal"" action=""goto..."" method=""post""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""form-group""&gt;

          &lt;input type=""text"" class=""form-control"" name=""telefono"" placeholder=""telefono de Contacto"" required&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=""form-group""&gt;
          &lt;label for=""textArea"" class=""sr-only""&gt;Textarea&lt;/label&gt;
          &lt;textarea class=""form-control"" rows=""3"" placeholder=""Mensaje"" name=""mensaje"" required&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=""form-group""&gt;
          &lt;div id=""form_request_result""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=""modal-footer""&gt;
        &lt;button type=""reset"" class=""btn btn-default""&gt;&lt;i class=""fa fa-eraser""&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Borrar&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;button type=""submit"" id=""myRequestButton"" class=""btn btn-ghost""&gt;&lt;i class=""fa fa-send""&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Enviar&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- Signin Modal Not rdy yet--&gt;

&lt;footer id=""footer_design""&gt;
  &lt;!-- Footer Content --&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I got a custom.js file where all the codes goes inside a load </p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){

jQuery(function(){
jQuery('#footer_holder').load('footer.html');
});

some other codes... Then validate form when user fire modal

$('#requestModal').formValidation({
        framework: 'bootstrap',
            err: {
            container: 'tooltip'
            },

            },
            mensaje: {
                validators: {
                    notEmpty: {

                    }
                }
            }
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>So, when I open whatever.html everything goes well, the footer loads inside the page and all good, but, when user call the Modal and click the submit Button it doesn't validate... All i can think is that the page already load and the form didn't exist when the validation was fired but I don't know how to check that on java/jquery... Like I said before, if I use require_once 'footer.html' it works, I apreciate any help on this, Thanks.</p>

<p>I have a class called <code>ImageLoader</code>.</p>

<p>When I call ImageLoader's <code>getPicture( pictureID )</code>, if the picture is not cached, I store <code>pictureID</code> in an instance variable, create a new thread which eventually calls my <code>callback()</code> function in this same <code>ImageLoader</code> class.  <code>callback()</code> then uses this <code>pictureID</code> as the key to cache the picture.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>Do you see the pickle?
If I call <code>getPicture( somePictureID )</code> twice in a row, and the <code>callback()</code> function for the first call hasn't happened yet, I will overwrite the previous <code>pictureID</code> which the <code>callback()</code> function will use. (See the code below if you still don't see the pickle.)</p>

<p>Now I know you're thinking, why don't I just add a little synchronization on the variable to make it thread-safe?</p>

<p>Because who knows how long the thread querying the picture will take, and that could really slow down the whole process of loading multiple images.</p>

<p><strong>How I'm Thinking of Solving It</strong></p>

<p>So my bright idea is to create an inner class that servers as a slave and only has a single use.  I execute some function in this slave class once, and I never reuse the object.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Is this an appropriate approach to solving this kind of problem? I feel like this might fall into some pattern I'm not aware of. If I'm totally off the mark with this one, can you suggest another solution?</p>

<p><strong>Simplified Code</strong></p>

<pre><code>//the instance variable with a race condition
private int pictureID

//loads the image associated with the pictureID
public void getPicture( int pictureID )
{
     Bitmap bitmap = cache.get( pictureID );
     if ( bitmap != null )
     {
         //load image
         return; 
     }

     int post_params[] = { pictureID, /* more parameters */ };

     this.pictureID = pictureID; //PROBLEM: race condition!
     new HttpRequest( this ).execute( post_params ); //starts new thread and queries server
}

 //gets called when the query finishes, json contains my image
 public void callback( JSONObject json )
 {
    Bitmap bitmap = getBitmap( json ); //made up method to simplify code
    cache.put( this.pictureID, bitmap ); //PROBLEM: race condition!

    //load image
 }

On android, it is a duplication, 4 times, of a strip of the screen. about 20px wide, and 1/4 of the screen height, quadrupled up the right side of the screen. When I move objects through the area of the screen being copied, it is animated in the side bar.
on the Web build it is just black, but should be blue background.</p>

<p>I used this code: </p>

<pre><code>    public static void ConnectToFirewall(string strUsername, string strPassword, string strFirewallIp)
    {
        IPAddress[] ipaIpAddressCollection = Dns.GetHostAddresses(strFirewallIp);
        IPEndPoint ipeIpEndPoint = new IPEndPoint(ipaIpAddressCollection[0], intPort);
        Socket sckSocket = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);
        sckSocket.Connect(ipeIpEndPoint);
        string strData = strUsername + ""\r\n""+ strPassword + ""\r\n"";
        byte[] bytData = new byte[1024];
        bytData = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(strData);
        sckSocket.Send(bytData);
        byte[] bytDataReceived = new byte[1024];
        int intData = sckSocket.Receive(bytDataReceived);
        sckSocket.Close();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If I am not logged in, when I telnet to it, I receive the message: LOGIN, username: / Password:.
If I am logged on, I receive LOGOUT, username: / Password.</p>

<p>This works perfectly well with the above method for half of my firewalls, it does not seem to work (I keep getting login as if I had not tried to pass credentials). 
I also tried it with</p>

<pre><code>    TcpClient tcpConnection = new TcpClient(myip,myport);
</code></pre>

<p>but this gives the same result. It works for certain firewall ip's. fails for others. They are all in the same domain.</p>

<p>Does anyone have idea how I could get past this or what steps I could undertake to troubleshoot this or what may be the cause of some server not accepting this method, allthough it does accept if I telnet to it?</p>

<p>Any help or suggestions are appreciated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem lies in the way that
  ASP.NET implements the AES encryption
  algorithm to protect the integrity of
  the cookies these applications
  generate to store information during
  user sessions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a bit vague, but here is a more frightening part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first stage of the attack takes a
  few thousand requests, but once it
  succeeds and the attacker gets the
  secret keys, it's totally stealthy.The
  cryptographic knowledge required is
  very basic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All in all, I'm not familiar enough with the security/cryptograpy subject to know if this is really that serious.</p>

<p>So, should all ASP.NET developers fear this technique that <em>can own any ASP.NET website in seconds</em> or what?</p>

<p>How does this issue affect the average ASP.NET developer? Does it affect us at all?
In real life, what are the consequences of this vulnerability? And, finally: is there some workaround that prevents this vulnerability?</p>

<p>Thanks for your answers!</p>

<h2>EDIT: Let me summarize the responses I got</h2>

<p>So, this is basically a ""padding oracle"" type of attack. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3720720/how-serious-is-this-new-asp-net-security-vulnerability-and-how-can-i-workaround-i/3721473#3721473"">@Sri</a> provided a great explanation about what does this type of attack mean. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yghiC_U2RaM"">Here is a shocking video about the issue!</a></p>

<p>About the seriousness of this vulnerability: Yes, it is indeed serious. <em>It lets the attacker to get to know the machine key of an application.</em> Thus, he can do some <strong>very</strong> unwanted things.</p>

<ul>
<li>In posession of the app's machine key, the attacker can decrypt authentication cookies.</li>
<li>Even worse than that, he can <strong>generate authentication cookies</strong> with the name of any user. Thus, he can appear as anyone on the site. The application is unable to differentiate between you or the hacker who generated an authentication cookie with your name for himself.</li>
<li>It also lets him to decrypt (and also generate) <strong>session cookies</strong>, although this is not as dangerous as the previous one.</li>
<li>Not so serious: He can decrypt the encrypted ViewState of pages. (If you use ViewState to store confidental data, you shouldn't do this anyways!)</li>
<li><strong>Quite unexpected</strong>: With the knowledge of the machine key, the attacker <strong>can download</strong> any arbitrary file from your web application, even those that normally can't be downloaded! (Including <strong>Web.Config</strong>, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a bunch of good practices I got that <strong>don't</strong> solve the issue but help improve the general security of a web application.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zhhddkxy%28VS.80%29.aspx"">You can encrypt sensitive data with Protected Configuration</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/08/protecting-your-cookies-httponly.html"">Use HTTP Only cookies</a></li>
<li>Prevent DoS attacks</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let's focus on this issue.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/09/18/important-asp-net-security-vulnerability.aspx"">Scott Guthrie published an entry about it on his blog</a></li>

</ul>

<p>The solution</p>

<ul>
<li>Enable customErrors and make a single error page to which <strong>all errors</strong> are redirected. Yes, <strong>even 404s</strong>. (ScottGu said that differentiating between 404s and 500s are essential for this attack.) Also, into your <code>Application_Error</code> or <code>Error.aspx</code> put some code that makes a random delay. (Generate a random number, and use Thread.Sleep to sleep for that long.) This will make it impossible for the attacker to decide what exactly happened on your server.</li>
<li>Some people recommended switching back to 3DES. In theory, if you don't use AES, you don't encounter the security weakness in the AES implementation. As it turns out, this is <strong>not recommended at all</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other thoughts</p>

<ul>
<li>Seems that <a href=""http://www.onpreinit.com/2010/09/aspnet-vulnerability-workaround-flawed.html"">not</a> <a href=""http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/linqed/archive/2010/09/19/padding-oracle-asp-net-vulnerability-explanation.aspx"">everyone</a> thinks the workaround is good enough.</li>
</ul>

I'm using NEST and lambda expression to create the query.</p>

<p>However, I need to perform the aggregation on multiple fields of the same document  (channel1 and channel2) at the same time.
Currently I have 2 channels so my query works fine over them.  </p>

<pre><code>    var res = elasticClient.Search&lt;DataRecord&gt;(s =&gt; s
        .Index(ElasticIndexName)

            )
        )
    );

<p>The problem is that the no. of channels could be different, maybe three or four or whatever so I'd like to have my Func below</p>

<pre><code>ag =&gt; ag.Average(""avg1"", b =&gt; b.Field(""channel1"")).Average(""avg2"", b =&gt; b.Field(""channel2""))
</code></pre>

<p>to be dynamically created (like you do on a SQL query for example) because the no. of channels is known only at runtime.</p>

<p>E.g.
If I have four channels the query should be like:</p>

<pre><code>  var res = elasticClient.Search&lt;DataRecord&gt;(s =&gt; s
        .Index(ElasticIndexName)
        .Aggregations(a =&gt; a

                .Aggregations(ag =&gt; ag.Average(""avg1"", b =&gt; b.Field(""channel1"")).Average(""avg2"", b =&gt; b.Field(""channel2"")).Average(""avg3"", b =&gt; b.Field(""channel3"")).Average(""avg4"", b =&gt; b.Field(""channel4"")))

<blockquote>
  <p>The optimizer will only combine modules that are specified in arrays
  of string literals that are passed to top-level require and define
  calls, or the require('name') string literal calls in a simplified
  CommonJS wrapping. So, it will not find modules that are loaded via a
  variable name:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK so far so good. This basically means <em>r.js</em> won't include nor crawl nested dependencies. Now lets assume we have a ""main application"" file which looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>require([ 'es5shim', 'tools' ], function() {
    console.log('fictive app entry point');

    require([ 'domready!' ], function( doc ) {
        console.log('domReady, loading GUI modules...');
        require([ 'GUI/window', 'GUI/header', 'GUI/content' ]);
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>I guess the problem becomes pretty obvious here. <em>r.js</em> (the optimizer) creates that file by only linking <code>es5shim.js</code> and <code>tools.js</code> into it. Is there any good way / workaround to tell that optimizer, that it also should link the <code>window.js</code>, <code>header.js</code> and <code>content.js</code> files in this example ?</p>

<p>Of course the <code>domReady</code> plugin in this instance will get loaded and it will eventually execute the callback, but the structure itself here it seems, prevents the optimizer from doing its job.</p>

<p><strong>Question are</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I just would list all modules in the ""Top require call"", would <em>r.js</em> also include+link all top <code>require</code> and <code>define</code> calls from nested and nested-nested modules into the <em>main-app</em> file ?</p></li>
<li><p>They are mentioning the <em>include</em> option for <em>r.js</em> in the Docs. Does it make sense here and if so, how to properly invoke it ?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course you don't want to lose the option to lazy-load modules later-on, but for this kind of dependency (waiting for DOMContentLoaded), I hope there is a way to workaround that.</p>

<pre><code>*matrice_prezent = (int *)malloc((linii+2) * sizeof(int));
for(i = 0; i&lt;linii+1; i++)
    matrice_prezent[i] = (int *)malloc((coloane+2) * sizeof(int));

*matrice_next = (int *)malloc((linii) * sizeof(int));
for(i = 0; i&lt;linii; i++)
    matrice_next[i] = (int *)malloc((coloane) * sizeof(int));
</code></pre>

<p>First part works great, no issues. Trying to do the same thing to <code>matrice_next</code> however, results in this error <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code>. Using the debugger(I am using Xcode btw, forgot to mention) I see that at the beginning of the code (<code>int **matrice_prezent, **matrice_next</code>) the first one has an address <code>0x...</code> while the latter has <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>I understand that this error means I'm trying to use memory that isn't available(or something along those lines). I'm not sure if it's a mistake on my part (since the first set of <code>malloc</code> works), or if I have to force it somehow to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

One already had a good gem wrapper that provided all the functionality I needed.  The other didn't, so I wrote the code myself with the plan of packaging it as a gem and using it in my app.  The code is done, but needs some refactoring as well some setup to properly turn it into a gem.  Unfortunately, I need to finish the app quickly for a demo I'm doing in a couple of days and just want to add the code to my existing app for the moment and then extract it out later to make a gem.  </p>

<p>I'm a new programmer(about 3 months), so I'm still getting some of the convention and what not.  What I'm not sure is where to put the code in my rails app.  Does it go in the model, controller, or do I build a separate helper module.  The code for the app is here: <a href=""https://github.com/gbcosgrove/sunlight-influence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gbcosgrove/sunlight-influence</a>.  It consists of an API call constructor and then separate files for each category.  I'm still in the process of refactoring because I find it easier to just write code that works and then go back and iterate until its clean.  </p>

<p>The Setup: I have a database of two tables:</p>

<pre><code>BookTitles:
- Book_Id
- BookName

BookAuthors:
- Author_Id
- AuthorName
- Book_Id
</code></pre>

<p>In the BookAuthors table, the ""Book_Id"" is the Foreign Key from BookTitles table.
I Use Entity Framework, Database First. EF created the models for me, so the model of BookTitles looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class BookTitles
{
    public BookTitles()
    { this.BookAuthors = new HashSet&lt;BookAuthors&gt;(); }

    public int Book_Id { get; set; }
    public string BookName { get; set; }

    public virtual ICollection&lt;BookAuthors&gt; BookAuthors { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>THE WAY IT WORKS: If i use this function to add one Book record (which will contain a list of BookAuthors) to the database, it works fine. And the Function below will add one record to the BookTitles table, and thwo record to the BookAuthors table. Here I use the ""Add"" method:</p>

<pre><code>private static void InsertBook()
{
    using (var db = new BooksContext())
    {
        var authors = new List&lt;BookAuthors&gt;()
        {
            new BookAuthors() {AuthorName = ""Author 1""},
            new BookAuthors() {AuthorName = ""Author 2""}
        };

        var book = new BookTitles {BookName = ""Book1"", BookAuthors = authors};

        db.BookTitles.Add(book);
        db.SaveChanges();
     }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>THE WAY IT DOESN'T WORK: If i try to add a list of Books to the database, using the AddRange(), it will throw an error ""Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute"":</p>

<pre><code>private static void AddRangeOfBooks()
{
    using (var db = new BooksContext())
    {
        var listOfAuthors = new List&lt;BookAuthors&gt;
        {
            new BookAuthors() {AuthorName = ""Author1""},
            new BookAuthors() {AuthorName = ""Author2""}
        };

        var listOfBooks = new List&lt;BookTitles&gt;
        {
            new BookTitles() {BookName = ""Book 1"", BookAuthors = listOfAuthors},
            new BookTitles() {BookName = ""Book 2"", BookAuthors = listOfAuthors}
        };

        db.BookTitles.AddRange(listOfBooks);
        db.SaveChanges();
    }
}
</code></pre>

I have several buttons that I alter the CSS (by using classes) with a mousedown (button press) and completion of click (mousedown+mouseup). Problem is that if you click on the element then release the mouse button outside of the element, that the mouseup does not fire. I've also tried capturing a general ""mouseup"" event on the document to ""reset"" the classes assigned to the element and that does not seem to work either.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""qbuttons""&gt;
&lt;a id=""qb_appointments"" href=""#"" class=""appointments""&gt;&lt;div&gt;

});

<p>I've tried different selectors for the mouseup -- document, window, âbody *â, âhtml <em>â and â</em>â -- from what I am seeing it appears that the mouseup is not firing on release of the mouse button outside of the mousedown element, because the alert does not happen.</p>

By ""time aware"" I mean something like ""giving more weight to data sampled at similar time of day"", but (a) I'll give a more precise definition and (b) this is only an example for something more general that interests me.</p>

<p>I'll start by defining ""time aware"" by giving a precise example that assumes that data is sampled in constant intervals during the day; say, every 1 hour. In that case, I keep 24 different EMAs, and whenever data is sampled, I put it into the relevant EMA, taking its result and putting it in a general EMA of the results. So, at 12:00, Tuesday, I get the result of the EMA of the EMA results for 12:00, 11:00, 10:00, etc. where the EMA result for 12:00 is the EMA of some typical period of x days of data sampled at 12:00, etc.</p>

<p>This is an online algorithm which works well and provides reasonable results for the case where the data is sampled in constant time intervals. Without that assumption, its results become meaningless, or perhaps it is not even well defined.</p>

<hr>

<p>The more general case can be described so: at a given moment I have a set of samples, each is a tuple <em>(x,v)</em> where <em>x</em> is some sample invariant (can be thought of as the sampling ""location"") and <em>v</em> is the sampling ""value"", and I would like to find out the (weighted) average at some ""location"" <em>y</em>, where the weights have negative correlation to the distances of <em>y</em> from <em>x</em>. This generalizes the previous problem by letting <em>x</em> be the pair <em>(t,d)</em> where <em>t</em> is the sampling time and <em>d</em> is the time-of-day (hour, in our case), and by defining some metric on the set of all such tuples which will describe well our needs. A reasonable demand would be to decide that if <em>d</em> is constant, the weight function on the distances will be similar to that of exponentially moving average (perhaps a continuous version of it).</p>

<p>The main problem is finding an efficient online algorithm that does the work in the general case, or define a specific metric which allows such an efficient online algorithm, or show that in almost any interesting case it is impossible.</p>

It is a large project and having painstakingly updated all the vital bits of code to work with Flex4 it now happliy compiles.</p>

<p>Most of the components in the project decend over quite a few generations from an mx based component, so I have not yet updated this to spark due to the workload. The problem I am having is that I cannot get the embedded font to work for spark components that I now add to my mx components.</p>

<p>For example, I have edited one of my (mx based) components and added some  items to it. My embedded font has to have embedAsCFF=false so that it works for my mx components. So to get this to <em>also</em> embed for spark, I should be able to simply embed it again with embedAsCFF=true as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>@font-face
{
    src: url(""assets/fonts/MyriadWebPro.ttf"");

}

<p>I have tried a basic example of this that Adobe provides and this example works just fine, but in my complex project, it does not work. I do not get any errors, but instead of the spark component using MyriadWebPro it defaults to Times.</p>

<p>I wonder if this is because my component is mx based rather than spark based. Maybe this only works if you are using an mx component inside a spark component? If so does anyone know of a solution to the problem where you have an mx component and want to have a spark Label inside that?</p>

To clarify a bit, I need to be able to use 100 or so texture2d's and then assign them a vector2 XY value for a tile map that would have around 70 million tiles. I just need a refernce of which texture2d goes with which vector2. I will be dynamically/procedurally generating the tile/co-ordinate sets I just need a method of storing all of them now that won't blow up my ram. I tried to use a dictionary with the vector2 as the key and the texture2d as the value but that killed over on me with an OutOfMemoryException. So I then tried Wintellect Power Collections and used their MultiDictionary. But even if i assigned a texture2d as the only key and used the vector2 as the 70 million values to that key it still killed over with the same exception. </p>

<p>So I'm at a loss as to how I should proceed now. I just need to store the references for later access. I'm not trying to draw them to the screen or anything like that so I can't figure out why it takes 700mb of ram just for the dictionary. As an after thought I just realized that I've been letting these dictionaries resize themselves. Could that be the issue ?</p>

<p>I hope this was specific enough I've been up all night so I won't bother cleaning up and posting any code right now. If you think my code is the culprit and not my methods though, let me know and I'll post it for you. Looking forward to your answers.</p>

<p>EDIT: Ok here's the code I'm working with right now. I cleaned it up a bit but I know its not the greatest looking code. If you see any obvious problems or even inefficiencies I'd be happy to hear about them. Just don't bash me to badly since this is the first time I've worked with c# :)</p>

This would be used by an external website that displays basic cart information from the Magento store. I'm trying to avoid a full-blown custom MVC model if possible since I'm just trying to get minimal read-only information.</p>

<p>I want to display:</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of items in the shopping cart (whether or not they have
logged in)</li>
<li>the product names in the cart if it's not empty</li>
<li>whether or not the user is logged in</li>
<li>customer name if they have logged in</li>
</ul>

<p>I've seen many posts about this on the net and have tried all the examples without success.</p>

Why does case 2 allow the function to change the value of the dictionary entry globally, even though the dictionary is never returned by the function? A main reason I am using functions is to isolate everything in the function from the rest of the code, but this does not seem to be possible if I choose to use the same variable names inside of the function. I was under the understanding that anything explicitly defined in a function is local to that function, but this does not seem to be the case if the dictionary is <strong>defined and passed as an input to the function</strong>.</p>

<p>EDIT: I got it fixed.  I need to wait a while to answer my own question though, not enough reputation.  Basically, since I'm getting the cookie with SSL, the cookie needs to be prefixed with SACSID rather than ACSID and the testuser url needs to be https as well since that's the cookie we're using.</p>

Since I'll therefore be switching R sessions to create the summary object for each dataset, it'd be good to be able to load in the definition of the class from a saved object (or have it load automatically) rather than having to include the long definition of the object at the top of each script (which I assume is bad practice anyway because the code defining the object might become inconsistent). </p>

<p>(Please be noted that it's a problem on app development, not for a normal user guide)</p>

<p>I have a trouble when search device' services via Wifi at the same time with searching device via Bluetooth.</p>

<p><strong>For more info:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>On wifi search, I use Bonjour protocol (an Apple's implement of Zeroconf which can help locating services that local network devices offer). The Java implement that I use is <a href=""http://jmdns.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">jmdns</a>. During the search session, I create a <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager.MulticastLock.html"" rel=""nofollow"">MulticastLock</a> in order to receive multicast packages of Bonjour.</p></li>
<li><p>On bluetooth search, I just use BluetoothAdapter together with BroadcastReceiver to get bluetooth device info.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Problem happens to the search result, whenever two search sessions above are executed at the same time, mysearch  result on Bonjour (Wifi) search has never get enough like it does when only it is executed.</p>

<p><em>Ex:</em> Bonjour search just gets 1 instead of 2 device' services when search together with Bluetooth. Bluetooth search result is always enough, however.</p>

<p>This is tried many times and I surely confirm that there is nothing related to <strong>network' strength</strong> problems.</p>

<p>Has anyone met this problem yet?</p>

<p>Even if your situation is about using Wifi together with Bluetooth, any experiences or guests are very helpful to me!</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>  if ( execl( ""./my-app"", ""-restart"", fd.c_str(), NULL ) &lt; 0 ) {

<p>Didn't take long to figure out that Ruby has no <code>execl()</code> equivalent, but that you can fake it in part using <code>Process::spawn</code> and the <code>:close_others</code> option. Or, at least I should be able to according to the <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Process.html#method-c-spawn"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>file descriptor inheritance: close non-redirected non-standard fds (3, 4, 5, ...) or not

<p>Which will allow the child access to the descriptors... however I cannot figure out how to <code>exit</code> the parent process without closing all the descriptors. In other words, if I cause the parent to <code>exit</code> at the end of the code:</p>

<pre class=""lang-rb prettyprint-override""><code>server_fd = @server.to_i
env = {
  ""APP_REBOOT""    =&gt; ""true"",
  ""APP_SERVER_FD"" =&gt; server_fd.to_s,
}
command = ""ruby my-app.rb""
options = {
  :in           =&gt; :in,
  :out          =&gt; :out,
  :err          =&gt; :err,
  :close_others =&gt; false,
}
pid = Process.spawn env, command, options
Process.detach pid
exit # ADDED THIS LINE
</code></pre>

<p>Then the descriptors are also closed for the child.</p>

<p>I have a feeling this is more a problem with my approach to process management than something specific to Ruby but I don't see what I'm doing wrong.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT1</strong>
Just before my call to <code>Process.spawn</code> (or <code>Process.exec</code> as @mata points out) I have a diagnostic output:</p>

<pre class=""lang-rb prettyprint-override""><code>system 'lsof -c ruby'
</code></pre>

<p>And another call to that just inside my <code>recover_from_reboot</code> method. This is the tail of output pre-reboot, you can see the listening server port and a connected client on the last two lines:</p>

<pre><code>ruby    8957 chris    0u   CHR    136,1      0t0        4 /dev/pts/1

</code></pre>

<p>And this is what I see post-reboot:</p>

<pre><code>ruby    8957 chris    3r  FIFO    0,8      0t0 12203947 pipe
ruby    8957 chris    4w  FIFO    0,8      0t0 12203947 pipe

ruby    8957 chris    6w  FIFO    0,8      0t0 12203948 pipe
</code></pre>

<p>Again this is whether I try <code>spawn</code> or <code>exec</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong>
Given my diagnostic output, I see that the server keeps binding to fd 7, and the client to 8. By adding</p>

<pre class=""lang-rb prettyprint-override""><code>7 =&gt; 7,
8 =&gt; 8,
</code></pre>

<p>to my <code>options</code> array, I am able to successfully persist these sockets across reboot using <code>exec</code>. It is feasible for me to manually add the server and <code>[client1, client2,...]</code> <code>fd</code>s to the options hash, but this seems very dirty when <code>:close_others</code> is supposed to do the heavy lifting for me.</p>

<p>Sometimes it works.  Sometimes I get ""param not found: model1""</p>

<p>My understanding is that it fails (when it does) because the web page being submitted doesn't have any param called ""model1"" and that it works (when it does) because something I have done has caused the web page submission to have this param.  In the latter case, the param is a hash representing the fields of the model, with members for attr1, attr2, etc.</p>

<p>Does it work when I use ""form_for"" (which specifies a model) but not the other kind of form call, which is not tied to a model?</p>

<p>Note: I am writing because I've had this problem for several weeks with no progress.  I have searched the Rails doc and lots of instructional examples on the web but with no luck.  I know I'm being dense, but so far I've not found a real API reference document, nor a real API programmer's guide that covers strong parameters.  </p>

<p>I've found lots of examples on strong parameters but none of them clearly explain how it works, that would let me figure out on my own what I am doing wrong.</p>

"13032918","1","13060415","","2012-10-23 14:36:19","","12","2875","<p>So I have a classloader (MyClassLoader) that maintains a set of ""special"" classes in memory. These special classes are dynamically compiled and stored in a byte array inside MyClassLoader. When the MyClassLoader is asked for a class, it first checks if its <code>specialClasses</code> dictionary contains it, before delegating to the System classloader. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
    Map&lt;String, byte[]&gt; specialClasses;

    public MyClassLoader(Map&lt;String, byte[]&gt; sb) {
        this.specialClasses = sb;
    }

    @Override
    public Class&lt;?&gt; loadClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {
        if (specialClasses.containsKey(name)) return findClass(name);
        else return super.loadClass(name);
    }

    @Override
    public Class findClass(String name) {
        byte[] b = specialClasses.get(name);
        return defineClass(name, b, 0, b.length);
    }    
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I want to perform transformations (e.g. instrumentation) on the <code>specialClasses</code>, I can do so simply by modifying the <code>byte[]</code> before i call <code>defineClass()</code> on it. </p>

<p>I would also like to transform the classes which are provided by the System classloader, but the System classloader doesn't seem to provide any way of accessing the raw <code>byte[]</code> of the classes it provides, and gives me the <code>Class</code> objects directly. </p>

<p>I could use a <code>-javaagent</code> instrument all classes loaded into the JVM, but that would add overhead to the classes which I do not want to instrument; I only really want the classes loaded by MyClassLoader to be instrumented.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there any way of retrieving the raw <code>byte[]</code> of the classes provided by the parent classloader, so I can instrument them before defining my own copy? </li>
<li>Alternately, is there any way of emulating the functionality of the System classloader, in terms of where it grabs it's <code>byte[]</code>s from, so that MyClassLoader can instrument and define its own copy of all the System classes (Object, String, etc.)?</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>So I tried another approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using a <code>-javaagent</code>, Capture the <code>byte[]</code> of every class that is loaded and store it in a hashtable, keyed by the name of the class.</li>
<li>MyClassLoader, instead of delegating the system classes to its parent classloader, would instead load their bytecode from this hashtable using the class name and define it</li>
</ul>

<p>In theory this would let MyClassLoader define its own version of the system classes with instrumentation. However, it fails with a</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.SecurityException: Prohibited package name: java.lang
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly the JVM does not like me defining the <code>java.lang</code> classes myself, even though it should (in theory) be from the same <code>byte[]</code> source that the bootstrap-loaded classes should come from. The search for a solution continues.</p>

<p>EDIT2:</p>

<p>I found a (really sketchy) solution for this problem, but if someone who knows more than me about the intricacies of the Java classloading/instrumentation can come up with something less sketchy, that would be awesome.</p>

<p>I have heard that in a good VM like Java's or C#'s, you shouldn't do this. Setting <code>someObject</code>'s <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> to <code>null</code> will slow down garbage collection because the GC takes longer to find out that the objects <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> previously referred to are no longer referenced, while if you leave them intact the GC will immediately check upon them when cleaning up <code>someObject</code>. </p>

<p>Assuming what I heard is true (correct me if not), is it the same for AVM2, the ActionScript 3 VM (specifically in the latest versions of Flash Player)? </p>

<p>The reason I ask is I have a colleague who does it like that, because he has learned at a previous employer that it's faster, and that Flash has many quircks like that (which I find easy to believe).</p>

<p>I'm just wondering if that information is still up to date (for other Flash optimizations like that as well). In my experience optimization tricks like that get outdated rather quickly in a living platform.</p>

I've looked at multiple questions, <strong>Dictionaries do work, this conclusion was found in error(and I tried to use dictionaries(which most of the answers suggest), but they haven't worked.)</strong> The only other answers I could find was to use exec(), but they always seem to be accompanied by a comment saying they're dangerous, so I've steered clear of them.</p>

<p>On to my question:
This is an example of the code that I've been working on in Pygame:</p>

<pre><code>import pygame,sys
from pygame.locals import *
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800,230))
pygame.display.set_caption('Example')
tickclock = pygame.time.Clock()
change = 1
car1 = pygame.image.load('Car1.png')
car2 = pygame.image.load('Car2.png')
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        elif event.type == KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == K_ESCAPE:
                pygame.quit()
                sys.exit()
            elif event.key == K_SPACE:#To change the picture when the user presses space
                change = change + 1
    #Current way-----#
    if change == 1:
        screen.blit(car1,(0,0))
    elif change == 2:
        screen.blit(car2,(0,0))
    #Continue until all pictures are used...
    elif change &gt; 2:#The 2 will change based on the amount of pictures.
        change = 1
    #----------------#
    pygame.display.flip()
    tickclock.tick(60)
</code></pre>

<p>Where it is commented as ""current way"" is where my question is. Using this message of if/elif statements can take up a tun of lines if there are a lot of pictures for Pygame to display, and that would be doubled by the need to call screen.blit() every after every if/elif statement.</p>

<p>This is an example of what I would like to do:</p>

<pre><code>import pygame,sys
from pygame.locals import *
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800,230))
pygame.display.set_caption('Example')
tickclock = pygame.time.Clock()
varcar = 'car'
varnum = '1'
car1 = pygame.image.load('Car1.png')
car2 = pygame.image.load('Car2.png')
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        elif event.type == KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == K_ESCAPE:
                pygame.quit()
                sys.exit()
            elif event.key == K_SPACE:#To change the picture when the user presses space
                varnum = int(varnum)
                varnum = varnum + 1
                varnum = int(varnum)
    #Using this to substitute the class I set up for the actual file--#
    varcombined = varcar + varnum#To make varcombined = 'car1','car2',etc.
    if varnum &gt; 2:#To keep varnum within the loaded image numbers
        varnum = 1
    #-----------------------------------------------------------------#
    #The way I wish to use--------------------------------------------#
    #Some Code
    screen.blit(varcombined,(0,0))
    pygame.display.flip()
    tickclock.tick(60)
</code></pre>

<p>What I am trying to do here is combine the varcar and varnumber variable so that I can combine them in the varcombined variable while only changing the varnumber variable. This will give strings that are the same as the variable names of the loaded images: car1 and car2. Then what I want to do is somehow call the variables car1 and car2 in 'screen.blit(varcombined,(0,0))' on line 31 by using the string as a substitute to the actual variable name. (Without actually having to dynamicly create a new variable)</p>

<p>Is there a way this can be done, and if so, how can it be done?</p>

<p>Even though the question may seem a bit specific, I think this can benefit a lot of people who may have a need/want to use a string to call a variable.</p>

<p>If anyone doesn't understand what I'm asking, just say so, and I'll try to edit the question to clarify.</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong></p>

<p>Thank you to abarnert and Fernando Aires for their speedy answers. :)</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I should make this an edit or another question, but I need to expand my question a little due to recent issues.</p>

<p>I used abarnert's answer, and it worked like a charm.</p>

<pre><code>car_dictionary = {1: car1 2: car2}

#-----------#

screen.blit(car_dictionary[change], (0,0))
</code></pre>

<p>I would now like to ask, what I should do in the case that I added a 'truck1' and 'truck2' image, and now needed to not only interchange between 1 and 2 but also car and truck?
If there's a way to do that of course.</p>

The idea of this algorithms is to make inferences for the number of groups in a population. So let us say that we start with k groups.

And I have some variables for each group;</p>

<pre><code>double *mu;
double *lambda;
double **A

<p>mu and lambda are indeed arrays of k elements and A is a two dimensional array of kxN. N as well changes at each iteration. I have some data y1, y2,..., yn so at each iteration I do some process, propose new values for the parameters and decide if to move k or not.</p>

<p>So far I have tied to use malloc and realloc to deal with all this changes of the dimension of my parameters but I have to iterate this algorithm for let us say 100,000 times so at certain point it crashes. If I start with k=10 in my case at the third iteration!</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I use realloc at each iteration? or this is my big mistake. If yes well I imagine that should check my code!</li>

However, I think it has a problem. For example, if you have the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style type=""text/css""&gt;
.myclass{
padding:0px;
}
&lt;style&gt;

&lt;p class=""myclass"" style=""padding-top: 40px;""&gt;Test&lt;/p&gt;

<p>It will convert the above to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p class=""myclass"" style=""padding-top: 40px; padding:0px;""&gt;Test&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But the above is incorrect. It should prepend since the <code>padding-top</code> inline has priority as it is already inline. So it should be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p class=""myclass"" style=""padding:0px; padding-top: 40px;""&gt;Test&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But I am struggling where to make this edit in the class. I thought it would be straightforward and I could submit it to the class creator but I am struggling.</p>

3  blah3  high north

-- ----- ----------
1  blah5  super high south
2  blah6  medium high northern
3  blah7  kind of low north
4  blah8  kind of low south

<p>Now I want to add the records of <code>table2</code> to <code>table1</code>. But the data for columns <code>name2</code> and <code>name3</code> are combined in strings in <code>head2</code> of <code>table1</code>.  So I want to extract these fields from <code>head2' and put them in</code>table1' so that it looks like this</p>

<p>table1</p>

<pre><code>ID name1 name2 name3  
-- ----- ----- -----
1  blah1  high south
2  blah2  low  north 
3  blah3  high north 
4  blah4  low  south
5  blah5  high south
6  blah6  high north
7  blah7  low  north 
8  blah8  low  south

<p>Now I have in mind some kind of <code>IF</code> statement (but have no idea how to implement this in SQL)</p>

<pre><code>for each record in table2 do
    table1.name1.insert(head1)
    if table2.head2 == ""super high south"" then
        table1.name2.insert(high)
        table1.name3.insert(south)
    if table2.head2 == ""medium high northern"" then
        table1.name2.insert(high)
        table1.name3.insert(north)  

    etc....
</code></pre>

<p>In my actual application there is a limited number of unique string types in <code>head2</code> so an if statement for each one is feasible</p>

</code></pre>

<p>However, nothing gets drawn in the window except red color.
I have read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5458185/drawing-lines-with-glsl"">this</a>,<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11594247/opengl-lines-with-shaders"">this</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11594804/opengl-shader-two-object-and-one-line-to-connect-them"">this</a> questions. Two of them refer me to use Vertex Buffers and the third one tells me to draw a triangle with two vertices in the same position. </p>

<p>My question is, why does <code>glDrawArrays(GL_LINES, 0, 2)</code> in my code fail to draw a single line? Or is it essential that I use Vertex Array Buffers when I need to draw a single line?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Here is the code from the <code>main()</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>startShaders();

    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window))
    {
        RenderFunction();
        glfwSwapBuffers(window);
        glfwPollEvents();
    }
    shutdown();
    cout &lt;&lt; ""INFO: OpenGL Version: "" &lt;&lt; glGetString(GL_VERSION) &lt;&lt; endl;
    glfwTerminate();

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
</code></pre>

<p>And here is my <code>RenderFunction()</code> that calls <code>Display()</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>void RenderFunction()
{
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
    display();  
}
</code></pre>

<p>UPDATE 2:
Here is the pic of console window displaying <code>stderr</code> output.

<p>The AJAX function I've written works fine when it's called from a button, for example, but I can't get the date picker to call it.  The idea is that the user clicks a date and the function is then called.  I thought that is what the onSelect event is for, but it doesn't seem to work.</p>

<p>Here is the code I'm using on the date picker.</p>

});

<p>The program is a System Admin tool which pings each IP Address in a range, if there is a response it creates an object in the collection with some details from the computer.</p>

<p>The problem I am having, is poor performance. Initially, I was just updating the Collection and letting the datagrid pick up the changes. This caused an issue where the DataGrid control wasn't refreshing and showing the data unless I scrolled. </p>

<p>So I added a timer to call the grids refresh method, the timer ticks every 750ms. This worked brilliantly, until I realised that the programs UI is completely unresponsive while the timer is enabled and it is scanning.</p>

<p>Without the timer, performance is acceptable, without it, its terrible. I have tried several values for the timeout period (up to 2000ms) without any luck and have also made sure that my columns are fixed width (I read that autogenerated columns and widths can cause performance issues).</p>

<p>The amount of Row's in the grid is about 300 - 400 with 5 columns, so its not exactly a huge grid.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions of how I could get the grid to update in a timely manner when the collection behind is added to, without sacrificing performance?</p>

<p>Many times I come across posts here about someone trying to do the equivalent in XAML instead of code behind. Their only reason being they want to keep their code behind 'clean'. Correct me if I am wrong, but is not the case that: 

 <li>XAML is compiled too - into BAML - then at runtime has to be parsed into code anyway.</li>
 <li>XAML can potentially have more runtime bugs as they will not be picked up by the compiler at compile time - from incorrect spellings - these bugs are also harder to debug.</li>
 <li>There already is code behind - like it or not <pre><code>InitializeComponent();</code></pre> has to be run and the .g.i.cs file it is in contains a bunch of code though it may be hidden.</li>
</p>

<p>Is it purely psychological? I suspect it is developers who come from a web background and like markup as opposed to code.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I don't propose code behind instead of XAML - use both - I prefer to do my binding in XAML too - I am just against making every effort to avoid writing code behind esp in a WPF app - it should be a fusion of both to get the most out of it.</p>

It would work a lot like <a href=""https://www.twilio.com/labs/twimlets/message"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.twilio.com/labs/twimlets/message</a> except I want to write my own code so I can add more customizations.</p>

<p>I have started by building off of the <a href=""https://www.twilio.com/docs/howto/weatherbyphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Weather by Phone</a> demo because it contains customized text inside of xml.</p>

<p>I have created my own google appengine called gracklevoice, and I got the weatherbyphone example working. Now, I'm having trouble when I try to simplify it. My code looks like this:</p>

<p>There is the yaml file too:</p>

<p>This seems it should be really simple, but when my client app sets the call url to <a href=""http://gracklevoice.appspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gracklevoice.appspot.com/</a> I get an error instead of the voice message: ""We are sorry. an application error has occurred.

I found that resizeTo is working when the popup is created by window.open and I respected this rule.
And this is my problem, I have a popup window which is created by window.open in a page named A.aspx. </p>

<pre><code> var myWin = window.open(myUrl, '', ""width=400,height=250"");

<p>Then I tried to resize this popup by using resizeTo in another page named B.aspx. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;body bgcolor=""white"" ms_positioning=""GridLayout"" onload=""javascript:resizePopup();""&gt;
....
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" language=""javascript""&gt;
    function resizePopup() {
        var targetWidth = document.body.scrollWidth + 80;
        var targetHeight = document.body.scrollHeight + 80;
        window.resizeTo(targetWidth, targetHeight);
    }
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>This is not working at all. Then I tried to resize this popup by typing directly on the console</p>

<pre><code> resizeTo(1000,1000);
</code></pre>

<p>but it resizes my popup. I tried the same thing to make sure on the master window page and it doesn't work like it's written in the rule. 
Then I tried to resize the popup in A.aspx just after open and this is working. So I don't really understand about this.</p>

<p>Anyone can explain me this? Why it doesn't work or what I understand isn't correct?</p>

I am creating a sign up page that includes two  areas. I want these input areas to be inline with an icon that comes up while it is checking the database. </p>

<p>I have everything setup and I think my html is proper. I have created a row that contains both the input box and the whirly loader I got from the internet. The only problem is when I run it the whirly loader is way too big and is not totally in line with the input box. </p>

<p>here is my html:</p>

    &lt;input type=""text"" class=""form-control"" id=""usernameOrEmail"" placeholder=""Shattr Username or Email""&gt;

            &lt;div class=""whirly-loader"" id=""usernameSpinner"" style=""display: none;""&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt; 

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I then go in and point to the ""whirly-loader"" class, but nothing changes no matter what I set my width and height to. This may be too weird a question but if anyone has any suggestions that would be awesome. Here is my css:</p>

<pre><code> .whirly-loader{

 height:10%;
 width:10%;

<p>The existing convention is the <em>singular</em> entity name, prefixed with a lowercase ""t"" (e.g <code>tProduct</code>), and joined with an underscore for junction tables (e.g <code>tProduct_tOffer</code>).</p>

<p>I've achieved this with all the 'standard' tables using the code below. In my <code>DbContext</code> I have:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder) {
    modelBuilder.Conventions.Remove&lt;PluralizingEntitySetNameConvention&gt;();
    modelBuilder.Conventions.Add&lt;TableNamePrefixConvention&gt;();
    base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the following class adds the ""t"" to table names:</p>

<pre><code>public class TableNamePrefixConvention : IConfigurationConvention&lt;Type, EntityTypeConfiguration&gt; {
    public void Apply(Type typeInfo, Func&lt;EntityTypeConfiguration&gt; configuration) {
        configuration().ToTable(""t"" + typeInfo.Name);
    }

<pre><code>tOffer
tProduct
ProductOffers
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, <code>ProductOffers</code> should be named <code>tProduct_tOffer</code>. How can I force the generated junction table to conform to my naming style?</p>

&lt;/body&gt;   
&lt;/html&gt;

<p>IN here, Does <code>checkboxes</code> variable is a jquery object or dom element ?  I was thinking that $() returns a jquery object (as stated <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1302428/what-does-jquery-actually-return"">here</a>) but when I try, <code>checkboxes.attr('checked',true)</code> rather than <code>checkboxes[1].checked=true;</code> , I got error. My another assumption is that, may be <code>checkboxes</code> variable is a jquery object and <code>checkboxes[1]</code> is an <code>dom</code> element? Am I right?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>One more question, when I want to learn type of a variable, I'm writing browser's console this statement : typeof(VariableName).

The goal of this page is to display any documents that have been uploaded in the last 14 days.  The trick is that these documents could belong to any number of lists that are defined in any number of list definitions.  These are custom list definitions based on custom content types.  We do have a base content type that each of our custom content types inherit from.  They are also all part of the same content type group.  I have determined that it is not possible to use the SP UI to set up the CQWP to return items from multiple list types, since one of the required query fields is list type.  So - I'm attempting to use CAML to define this CQWP and this is where I'm having trouble.  My end goal is for the CAML to be defined in a site definition (onet.xml file) but I've also not had any luck with uploading a .webpart file from the SP UI.   I have found several articles that explain how this should be done but haven't been able to get the suggested solutions to work.  This <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa981241.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN article</a> tells me it should be possible using the ListsOverride element.  This is how the article tells me to do it:  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;![CDATA[
          &lt;Lists BaseType=""0""&gt;
          &lt;/Lists&gt; ]]&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Since I'm looking for Document Libraries I would use a base type of 1 rather than 0.</p>

<p>I have been unable to determine the syntax for what that would actually look like from within the onet.xml file so I thought I'd start with trying to get it uploaded as a .webpart file.</p>

<p>This is what the ListsOverride element looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;property name=""ListsOverride"" type=""string""&gt;
    &lt;![CDATA[&lt;Lists BaseType=""1""&gt;&lt;/Lists&gt;]]&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However - as soon as I upload a .webpart file with this in the CAML and add the webpart to a page I break that page in Sharepoint.  This is what I get:  </p>

<p>Server Error in '/' Application.
Attempted to use an object that has ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Research on that error points me to code that disposes of an object such as SPContext.Current.Web but I don't even have any code at all here.  It almost looks like the CQWP has a bug in it.  OR - I'm either not formatting that CAML properly or maybe I need to change something in a different element in the CAML?</p>

<p>I am running Sharepoint 2010 SP1 with all the latest patches. (I believe)</p>

<p>I've tried several other formats but without luck. </p>

<p>I tried getting rid of the embedded CDATA tags like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;property name=""ListsOverride"" type=""string""&gt;
    &lt;Lists BaseType=""1""&gt;&lt;/Lists&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But then Sharepoint won't let me upload the .webpart file.  (Invalid .webpart file)</p>

<p>The format with the embedded CDATA tags seems to be the only way it lets me upload the file.</p>

<p>I've tried (just for the sake of narrowing down my issue) to specify specific lists like this:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;property name=""ListsOverride"" type=""string""&gt;
&lt;![CDATA[&lt;Lists&gt;&lt;List Id=""{5a2f79bb-cc82-4171-88ac-65f20e7b5fa8}"" /&gt;&lt;/Lists&gt;]]&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>That doesn't break the page but the webpart gives me less than useful error on the page (Unable to display this Web Part)</p>

<p>I'm not 100% sure that I used the appropriate GUID in that attempt.  I got it from looking in the server explorer in Visual Studio (Under Lists and Libraries >> Document Libraries >> My List Type.  (I got the GUID from the Id property)</p>

<p>I should mention that I am fairly new with Sharepoint development.  I would have hoped that something seemingly so core to what Sharepoint does would be much easier than this.</p>

<p>Can someone please point out what I am doing wrong?   Maybe I'm going about the whole thing in the wrong way?   I appreciate any help that anyone can give me!</p>

<p>I have XML-Files with names like <em>SomeName999999blablabla.xml</em> with lots of content, where almost every line contains the string <code>""999999""</code>. I need identical xml-files where <code>999999</code> is replaced by <code>888888</code>, <code>777777</code>, and so on, in the name and the file's content.</p>

<h2>The problem...</h2>

<p>My code works fine and actually creates all the files I need, BUT there are sometimes tiny errors. Like in one line an E is ""randomly"" replaced by a D (it seems to be always one letter lower than what its supposed to be, but I can't confirm that 100%). Its not a lot, like one or two instances in 60 files, each file being about 100MB. But since its an xml this is a real problem, as this often is a schema violation, which causes a crash in later processing.
I have absolutely no idea where this is coming from or how to fix it, please help.</p>

<h2>My code so far...</h2>

<pre><code>private void createMandant(String mandant) throws Exception {
    String line;
    File dir = new File(TestConstants.getXmlDirectory());

    for (File file : dir.listFiles()) {

  <p>If open function receives a filename that does not contain a path, assumes that file is in same directory as program.</p>

<p>But it doesn't matter where I put the file, this won't work. Although, when I ""prefix the path literal with the letter r"", such as the following:</p>

    counter = counter + 1

print(""The number of lines is: "", counter)

<p>Then, it will work, but not display the lines that contain a digit.(How can I make it include these?)
Lastly, I also had to alter my code to allow a user to enter a file that they wanted to read, but only read the first 5 lines of the file, if less than will display all lines. It follows(This goes along with me not being able to simply type the name(""names.txt"") to search for the file):</p>

<pre><code>fileName = input(""Enter the location of the file: "")

<p>Why am I receiving this? (I also noticed that it adds an extra ""\"" next to each one that is already present - The error message contains 4 ""\"" while I only typed 2.)</p>

<p>In summary:
(1.) <code>""FileNotFoundError"" for ""names.txt"".</code>
(2.) How to make the <code>""readline()""</code> methd recognize digits(int's/float's).
(3.) <code>""Invalid Argument""</code> Traceback when a user inputs a file to be searched for.

What is the fastest way to sort an array of 6 ints?</p>

<p>As the question is very low level:</p>

<ul>
<li>we can't assume libraries are available (and the call itself has its cost), only plain C</li>
<li>to avoid emptying instruction pipeline (that has a <em>very</em> high cost) we should probably minimize branches, jumps, and every other kind of control flow breaking (like those hidden behind sequence points in &amp;&amp; or ||).</li>
<li>room is constrained and minimizing registers and memory use is an issue, ideally in place sort is probably best.</li>
</ul>

<p>Really this question is a kind of Golf where the goal is not to minimize source length but execution time. I call it 'Zening` code as used in the title of the book <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1883577039"">Zen of Code optimization</a> by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Abrash"">Michael Abrash</a> and its <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/02/there-aint-no-such-thing-as-the-fastest-code.html"">sequels</a>.</p>

<p>As for why it is interesting, there is several layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>the example is simple and easy to understand and measure, not much C skill involved</li>
<li>it shows effects of choice of a good algorithm for the problem, but also effects of the compiler and underlying hardware.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is my reference (naive, not optimized) implementation and my test set.</p>

<h2><strong>Raw results</strong></h2>

<p>As number of variants is becoming large, I gathered them all in a test suite that can be found <a href=""http://pastebin.com/azzuk072"">here</a>. The actual tests used are a bit less naive than those showed above, thanks to Kevin Stock. You can compile and execute it in your own environment. I'm quite interested by behavior on different target architecture/compilers. (OK guys, put it in answers, I will +1 every contributor of a new resultset). </p>

<p>I included both -O1 and -O2 results because surprisingly for several programs O2 is <strong>less</strong> efficient than O1. I wonder what specific optimization has this effect ?</p>

<h2><strong>Comments on proposed solutions</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Insertion Sort (Daniel Stutzbach)</strong></p>

<p>As expected minimizing branches is indeed a good idea.</p>

<p><strong>Sorting Networks (Daniel Stutzbach)</strong></p>

<p>Better than insertion sort. I wondered if the main effect was not get from avoiding the external loop. I gave it a try by unrolled insertion sort to check and indeed we get roughly the same figures (code is <a href=""http://pastebin.com/azzuk072"">here</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Sorting Networks (Paul R)</strong></p>

<p>The best so far. The actual code I used to test is <a href=""http://pastebin.com/azzuk072"">here</a>. Don't know yet why it is nearly two times as fast as the other sorting network implementation. Parameter passing ? Fast max ?</p>

<p><strong>Sorting Networks 12 SWAP with Fast Swap</strong></p>

<p>As suggested by Daniel Stutzbach, I combined his 12 swap sorting network with branchless fast swap (code is <a href=""http://pastebin.com/azzuk072"">here</a>). It is indeed faster, the best so far with a small margin (roughly 5%) as could be expected using 1 less swap. </p>

<p>It is also interesting to notice that the branchless swap seems to be much (4 times) less efficient than the simple one using if on PPC architecture.</p>

<p><strong>Calling Library qsort</strong></p>

<p>To give another reference point I also tried as suggested to just call library qsort (code is <a href=""http://pastebin.com/azzuk072"">here</a>). As expected it is much slower : 10 to 30 times slower...  as it became obvious with the new test suite, the main problem seems to be the initial load of the library after the first call, and it compares not so poorly with other version. It is just between 3 and 20 times slower on my Linux. On some architecture used for tests by others it seems even to be faster (I'm really surprised by that one, as library qsort use a more complex API).</p>

<p><strong>Rank order</strong></p>

<p>Rex Kerr proposed another completely different method : for each item of the array compute directly its final position. This is efficient because computing rank order do not need branch. The drawback of this method is that it takes three times the amount of memory of the array (one copy of array and variables to store rank orders). The performance results are very surprising (and interesting). On my reference architecture with 32 bits OS and Intel Core2 Quad E8300, cycle count was slightly below 1000 (like sorting networks with branching swap). But when compiled and executed on my 64 bits box (Intel Core2 Duo) it performed much better : it became the fastest so far. I finally found out the true reason. My 32bits box use gcc 4.4.1 and my 64bits box gcc 4.4.3 and the last one seems much better at optimising this particular code (there was very little difference for other proposals).</p>

<p><em>update</em>:</p>

<p>As published figures above shows this effect was still enhanced by later versions of gcc and Rank Order became consistently twice as fast as any other alternative.</p>

<p><strong>Sorting Networks 12 with reordered Swap</strong></p>

<p>The amazing efficiency of the Rex Kerr proposal with gcc 4.4.3 made me wonder : how could a program with 3 times as much memory usage be faster than branchless sorting networks? My hypothesis was that it had less dependencies of the kind read after write, allowing for better use of the superscalar instruction scheduler of the x86. That gave me an idea: reorder swaps to minimize read after write dependencies. More simply put: when you do <code>SWAP(1, 2); SWAP(0, 2);</code> you have to wait for the first swap to be finished before performing the second one because both access to a common memory cell. When you do <code>SWAP(1, 2); SWAP(4, 5);</code>the processor can execute both in parallel. I tried it and it works as expected, the sorting networks is running about 10% faster. </p>

<p><strong>Sorting Networks 12 with Simple Swap</strong></p>

<p>One year after the original post Steinar H. Gunderson suggested, that we should not try to outsmart the compiler and keep the swap code simple. It's indeed a good idea as the resulting code is about 40% faster! He also proposed a swap optimized by hand using x86 inline assembly code that can still spare some more cycles. The most surprising (it says volumes on programmer's psychology) is that one year ago none of used tried that version of swap. Code I used to test is <a href=""http://pastebin.com/azzuk072"">here</a>. Others suggested other ways to write a C fast swap, but it yields the same performances as the simple one with a decent compiler.</p>

<p>The ""best"" code is now as follow:</p>

<pre><code>static inline void sort6_sorting_network_simple_swap(int * d){
#define min(x, y) (x&lt;y?x:y)
#define max(x, y) (x&lt;y?y:x) 
#define SWAP(x,y) { const int a = min(d[x], d[y]);
                    const int b = max(d[x], d[y]);
                    d[x] = a; d[y] = b; }
    SWAP(1, 2);
    SWAP(4, 5);
    SWAP(0, 2);
    SWAP(3, 5);
    SWAP(0, 1);
    SWAP(3, 4);
    SWAP(1, 4);
    SWAP(0, 3);
    SWAP(2, 5);
    SWAP(1, 3);
    SWAP(2, 4);
    SWAP(2, 3);
#undef SWAP
#undef min
#undef max
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we believe our test set (and, yes it is quite poor, it's mere benefit is being short, simple and easy to understand what we are measuring), the average number of cycles of the resulting code for one sort is below 40 cycles (6 tests are executed). That put each swap at an average of 4 cycles. I call that amazingly fast. Any other improvements possible ?</p>

<p>Because of the TwoWay-Mode the user writes directly into the XML.</p>

<p>However, in Silverlight there is no option to bind like in the example above. But Microsoft added the XPathEvaluate-Method() in Silverlight 4.</p>

<p>So I was trying to bind the complete XDocument to every TextBox and use a converter along with the ConverterParameter to pass a XPath expression and evaluate it.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Grid x:Name=""LayoutRoot""&gt;
    &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding Path=Data, Converter={StaticResource TestKonverter}, ConverterParameter=//firstname, Mode=TwoWay}"" FontSize=""20"" /&gt;

        return value;
    }

<p>To get some kind of TwoWay-Binding, I thought of using the XPath-Expression to get the correct Node and write the new value in it. 
The problem is, in the ConvertBack-Method() I don't see a way how to get the XDocument. Is there any way to get the XDocument through the given parameters in ConvertBack, without making it somewhere as static?</p>

It does this using the ScrollToBottom function shown. Using the preview events shown, if the user clicks an item, it stops scrolling, even if more items are added.

<p>I want to know what is the best way of creating a scrolling table with fixed headers for this fiddle here: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/LKB9e/9/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/LKB9e/9/</a></p>

<p>I don't want seperate table headers and table body and I want the columns to stay matching.</p>

<p>Can somebody get my fiddle working to match this?</p>

<p>To use fiddle just click on the ""Add Queston"" button in the demo and it will keep appending rows into a table below.</p>

<p>At moment the table is scrolling with no fixed headers which is done by this:</p>

<pre><code>#details{
    height:500px;
    overflow:auto;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Below is the source code:</p>

<p>HTML table:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table id=""questionBtn"" align=""center""&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt; &lt;input id=""addQuestionBtn"" name=""addQuestion"" type=""button"" value=""Add Question"" onClick=""insertQuestion(this.form)"" /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;table id=""qandatbl"" align=""center""&gt;
&lt;thead class=""tblhead""&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th class=""qid""&gt;Question No&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th class=""question""&gt;Question&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th class=""optandans""&gt;Option and Answer&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th class=""noofreplies""&gt;Number of Replies&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th class=""weight""&gt;Number of Marks&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th class=""image""&gt;Image&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th class=""video""&gt;Video&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th class=""audio""&gt;Audio&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody class=""tblbody""&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Below is the javascript code where it append rows into the html table above:</p>

The main goal of the project is computational speed, and secondarily memory efficiency. I need to implement a serial version and a parallel version of the algorithm using MPI. In order to treat huge datasets, I use sparse matrices to store the data, but this is causing me some difficulties when working with MPI that I hope you can help me solve. </p>

<p><strong>Serial implementation</strong>: I implemented a sparse matrix as a ""dictionary-of-dictionaries"", where a dictionary is simply a vector of pairs (key, value) that is guaranteed to be sorted when accessed. Therefore, access is performed using binary searches in O(log N). My Dictionary class is similar to a <code>std::map</code>, but with less overhead since no dynamic management of the structure is needed: all the elements are added at the beginning of the program and no successive insertion/removals are performed. The main operation that I perform on my sparse matrices are rows look-ups and loops on rows/columns. My serial version works well and it shows good performances.     </p>

<p><strong>Parallel implementation with MPI</strong>: The previous sparse matrix implementation is not well adapted to MPI, since I use various std::lib data structures that would be difficult to send/receive with MPI. Therefore, I evaluated the following alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Using Boost.mpi library</strong>: this would allow me to send/receive my dictionary data structures directly. However, I would rather not use external libraries because my project will be run on some external machines where I am not guaranteed that boost is installed. </li>
<li><strong>Writing a custom MPI_type for the pairs (int, double)</strong>: this alternative would allow me to send the dictionaries since they are based on std::vectors. However, I would be obliged to have lots of send/receive for the various rows of the sparse matrix and the book-keeping. In addition, I am not confortable with custom MPI_types. </li>
<li><strong>Implementing the sparse matrix using the CSR format</strong>: I decided to implement a new sparse matrix class based on the CSR format. the class structure is the following:</li>
</ul>

<p>class sparse_matrix_csr    </p>

<pre><code>{
     public:
         various methods
     private:
         std::vector&lt;int&gt; _row_indices;
         std::vector&lt;int&gt; _row_start_indices;
         std::vector&lt;int&gt; _column_indices;
         std::vector&lt;double&gt; _values;
         bool _column_sorted_by_index;
};
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>_row_indices</code> vector contains the indices of the rows of the matrix. 
<code>_row_start_indices</code> contains the index of the first element of a given row in the <code>_column_indices</code>, which contains the column indices, and <code>_values vector</code>, which contains the elements of the matrix. In this way, to send a sparse matrix with MPI, I simply need to send these 4 vectors. </p>

<p><strong>My problem</strong>: It seems that this new implementation of a sparse matrix is causing me some cache problems, with a consequent slow-down of the program. In fact, I need to manipulate various sparse matrices simultaneously on either a 32-bit or 64-bit system. Do you have any suggestion on how to make this class more memory-efficient? How could I implement the same class so that all the data is stored in the heap memory and how could I access to the data in this case? Remember that this class must facilitate MPI send/receive instructions.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance, </p>

<p>The communication is done in a event page which is sending POST requests via the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object.</p>

<p>Because the hostname or IP address of the phone is configured in the options page I added <code>optional_permissions</code> to the manifest file and request them from the user after saving the options with <code>chrome.permissions.request</code>.</p>

<p>Cross-Origin XHR works now without any problems until I restart chrome...</p>

<p>After restarting chrome it seems like the requested permission is lost and I get the typical 
 <code>is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> error.</p>

<p>When I click on the extensions permissions I can also see that my requested permission is no longer listed.</p>

<p>Because the <code>chrome.permissions.request</code> is only working for a user gesture I can't request it during the load of my extension or on the fly. If I request the permission again in my options page I don't get asked again whether I want to allow it or not put the permission is granted and everything works again as usual.</p>

<p>Is there a way to get this permission granted persistent after requesting it? I only want the extension to have access to the endpoints it needs.</p>

<p>First I need to copy lines starting with ATOM whose 5th column matches each of the elements of the array chain to separate files:</p>

<pre><code>while read pdb ; do

for c in ""${chain[@]}"" ; do
#if [ ${#chain[@]} -eq 1 ] &amp;&amp; \
if [ $(echo ""$pdb"" | cut -c1-4) == ""ATOM"" ] &amp;&amp; \
   [ $(echo ""$pdb"" | cut -c22-23) == ""${chain[$c]}"" ]; then   
echo ""$pdb"" &gt;&gt; ../../properpdb/${pdbid}_${chain[$c]}.pdb
fi
done

done &lt; ${pdbid}.pdb
</code></pre>

<p>This works well (slow but sure). Both the commented and the uncommented versions work.</p>

<p>Next I want to copy lines that start with HETATM and whose 4th column matches elements of the hresname but only if those lines also match an element form the chain array at cloumn number 5th:</p>

<pre><code>while read pdb ; do

for c in ""${chain[@]}"" ; do
for h in ""${hresname[@]}"" ; do
if [ ${#chain[@]} -eq 1 ] &amp;&amp; \
   [ $(echo ""$pdb"" | cut -c1-6) == ""HETATM"" ] &amp;&amp; \
   [ $(echo ""$pdb"" | cut -c22-23) == ""${chain[$c]}"" ] \
   [ $(echo ""$pdb"" | cut -c18-20) == ""${hresname[$h]}"" ] ; then
echo ""$pdb"" &gt;&gt; ../../properpdb/${pdbid}_${chain[$c]}.pdb
fi
done
done

done &lt; ${pdbid}.pdb
</code></pre>

<p>However, this does not work. I repeatedly receive an error:</p>

<pre><code>line 66: [: too many arguments
</code></pre>

<p>Line 66 is:</p>

<pre><code>   [ $(echo ""$pdb"" | cut -c22-23) == ""${chain[$c]}"" ] \
</code></pre>

<p>Which puzzles me because the error happens even if I restrict the loop to chain arrays containing a single element. </p>

<p>According to other StackOverflow questions, it should be perfectly possible to do this in bash. Any idea what the problem could be? </p>

<p>This works fine on Linux (or at least Ubuntu 14.04.1). My host machine that is exhibiting the issue is OS X running Yosemite. </p>

<p>On Linux the the parent process receives the signal number 20 instead of 18 (as on OS X). </p>

<p>So conceptually there is only one daemon running on each machine.  So when using tibrvsend:</p>

<pre><code>tibrvsend -service 2323 -network ""someIPAddress"" -daemon ""myDaemon"" MESSAGE
</code></pre>

<p>Does it mean I am sending message using port 2323 on my localhost, through daemon <code>myDaemon</code> (which could be on remote), to network <code>comeIPAddress</code>?</p>

<p>When using tibrvlisten:</p>

<pre><code>tibrvListen -service 2323 -network ""someIPAddress"" -daemon ""myDaemon""
</code></pre>

<p>Does it mean I am listening using any available port, any available daemon on my localhost, to listen the messages from port 2323 of <code>myDaemon</code>"" that published to <code>someIPAddress</code> network?</p>

<p>Another question is, the book ""Tibco RV Concept"" mentioned that the same service cannot be bind to two networks.  Does it only apply to producer machines (since we don't specify port for listener machine)?  So an error will occur if we do:</p>

<pre><code>tibrvsend -service 2323 -network ""net1"" MESSAGE
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>tibrvsend -service 2323 -network ""net2"" MESSAGE
</code></pre>

<p>at the same time (it should be OK if we do it consecutively, right?)</p>

<p>but for listeners:</p>

<pre><code>tibrvlisten -service 2323 -network ""net1""
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>tibrvlisten -service 2323 -network ""net2""
</code></pre>

<p>should be perfectly fine? (otherwise it means producers need to know each others' port number in order to avoid conflict)</p>

<p>If I have totally messed up with the concepts, can you please explain with examples?</p>

<p>The example above is incorrect because t should have for every record in A a corresponding record in Table matched for each value (1,2,9).  The end goal is:</p>

<pre><code>public class CustomView extends View {
  public CustomView(Context context, int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1) {

My app is a web application and needs an Internet connectivity.

In brief, you get connected to the Internet or the USB when the device is on the cradle.</p>

<p>So, I need to create a C++ email client for a project at school, and I've been using the POCO open source C++ library, and I've been fine for working with email servers that do not need SSL authentication, but anything that DOES require SSL, I've had no luck...</p>

<p>Here is the documentation for POCO: <a href=""http://pocoproject.org/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pocoproject.org/docs/</a></p>

<p>When you go there, you have to click on POCO:Net, and then in the bottom left frame, there is a bunch of documentation for different NET objects... I've particularly been using POP3ClientSession.</p>

<p>I've installed OpenSSL and compiled the library with SSL support, but nothing seems to work... I've also followed this tutorial:
<a href=""http://pocoproject.org/wiki/index.php/NetSSL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pocoproject.org/wiki/index.php/NetSSL</a></p>

<p>If ANYONE has experience with POCO, or is just 1337 at SSL/C++, if you could help me get this working I would very much appreciate it! I've been working on this for the past 12 hours straight just to get SSL working, and have had 0 luck.</p>

<p>Well one of the things I'm not even quite sure about is if I compiled it with SSL correctly... I installed OpenSSH on my machine, and recompiled everything (took an hour!!!). I seemed to have everything compiled, but when I went to use it with the following include statement: </p>

<pre><code>#include ""Poco/Net/SecureStreamSocket.h""
</code></pre>

<p>Which is what the documentation told me to do, I got an error... They compiled in a folder called NetSSL_OpenSSL, so i took the headers and sources and copied them into the appropriate place in the Net folder, hoping for it to work. Afterwords I got another error:</p>

<pre><code>fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'Poco/Crypto/X509Certificate.h': No such file or directory I dont see Crypto anywhere...
</code></pre>

<p>But I do have the X509Certificate.h file... I even went as far as changing Crypto in the source to Net (because its the net folder that is now holding this file), but as I expect, that blew up in my face...</p>

<p>So, I guess the main question would be the following:</p>

<p>How can I send emails using POP3 with SSL sockets instead of the standard sockets used by the POP3ClientSession?</p>

I set the main form in the loader app as the parent of each pluginForm before calling Application.Run(pluginForm) inside the app domain. Hence when the pluginForm shows it always gets displayed in front of the mainForm of the loader app.</p>

<p>My problem is when a user clicks for the first time on the pluginForm (child form), it looses focus and the mainForm (loader app's form) gets focus. (However the pluginForm stays in front) Hence the user ends up having to click twice to get the pluginForm to focus for the first time.</p>

TypeError: $(...).fullCalendar is not a function   &lt;location calendar.js:48&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't understand what the errors mean.  Keep in mind I did not write these JavaScripts, so I don't understand them.</p>

<p>Hoping someone who has come across this error and solution can help.</p>

<p>We usually have a code freeze 2 days before release so that QA gets sufficient time to do regression and progression testing. After that if there are any fixes they go as patches on the server and are routed through the lead who reviews and notes these changes and are later checked in after QA has tested them.</p>

<p>Now I get messages saying Suspend and Resume are deprecated. In my situation, I know <em>exactly</em> what code the suspend was run on since the call itself is what suspended it! Resume, I know exactly what it is going to do. The only reason this was even done in the first place was because the mutex worked fine in Start() and Stop() in dot net 3.5 but dot net 4.0 changed so that Start() and Stop() were in different threads AND they marked the workaround as obsolete!</p>

<p>Is there a nice way, non-obsolete way of doing this?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>It turns out that my original question was too simplistic.</p>

<p>@RocketHazmat's answer did indeed address what I had originally asked, but when I went to use that info I found that I wasn't specific enough.</p>

<p>It turns out that I need to match elements in the root AND/OR the children. Seems that, as  @RocketHazmat says, .find() matches children but .filter() only matches the root.</p>

<p>Here's updated snippet and a new fiddle to demo:</p>

<pre><code>var html = ""&lt;div data-test='test1'&gt;"";     // Root
html += ""&lt;div data-test='test2'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"";  // Child
html += ""&lt;/div&gt;"";

// Convert HTML string to an orphaned JQ DOM object
var dom = $(html);

// Search orphaned DOM object for element(s) with the specified attr
// (We'll find none)
var found1 = dom.find('[data-test]');
$('#count1').html('count1='+found1.length+"", val=""+found1.attr('data-test'));

// Search orphaned DOM object for element(s) with the specified attr
// (We'll find none)
var found2 = dom.filter('[data-test]');
$('#count2').html('count2='+found2.length+"", val=""+found2.attr('data-test'));


// Now append the orphaned DOM to the document

<p>The databinding looked very nice at first, but after working with it, it just get worse and worse.</p>

<p>So here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>controllers.controller('DashboardCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.as = Demo.results[GATT.Dashboard.as];
    $scope.ac = Demo.results[GATT.Dashboard.ac];

    $scope.cs = Demo.results[GATT.Dashboard.cs];
    $scope.ts = Demo.results[GATT.Dashboard.ts];
    $scope.dd = Demo.results[GATT.Dashboard.dd];
    $scope.rc = Demo.results[GATT.Dashboard.rc];
    $scope.tps = Demo.results[GATT.Dashboard.tps];
    $scope.ls = Demo.results[GATT.Dashboard.ls];
    $scope.bm = Demo.results[GATT.Dashboard.bm];    
});

<p>The Demo.results object holds the pushed values from our bluetooth device.</p>

<p>We now have to ""simply"" show it in the view.</p>

<p>The example above is the code left, because $apply gives errors with the $digestion cycle.</p>

<p>$watch is working, but there seems to be no way of showing the changed values in the view.</p>

<p>So, I can alert ourselves a variable has changed, but we can't get the value to be actually displayed in the view.</p>

<p>Is there somebody who knows a bit more from this system than we do? Because this should be one of the most valuable things about angularjs. It is just broken. Or we broke it.</p>

When I make a .exe out of it using py2exe, it will run fine, however I do get some messages in the Windows Event Log (Application) that certain libraries are not found. Sometimes windows stops the service after startup, sometimes windows ignores the ""module not found"" errors. All of this takes place on a XP SP3 machine.</p>

<p>When I move the same .exe compiled w/py2exe to a Win 7 SP1 machine, win7 informs me that the .exe cannot run without python27.dll. So I move python27.dll in the cwd of the .exe, and Win 7 then tells me it has failed to load the .dll. When I try to run the .exe on a XP SP2 machine, XP tells me that the file cannot be loaded.</p>

<p>What is the best practice to retrieve all <em>item</em> rows, together with their tag names and tag colors âÂ e.g. to display them in a list of items with tags.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Solution 1</strong></p>

<p>Join both tables on item id:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM item JOIN item_tag ON id = item_id;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the problem that table <em>item</em> has many columns that contain large amounts of data, because each row in <em>item</em> would be present multiple times in the query result. Much data had to be transferred through the network to the client. Additionally the client would have to merge all rows with the same item data, to get the respective tags for each item.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Solution 2</strong></p>

<p>First the items are queriedâ¦</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM item;
</code></pre>

<p>â¦and afterwards the tags for each item are retrieved:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM item_tag WHERE item_id = ?;
</code></pre>

<p>But this would require multiple separate SQL queries â one for each <em>item</em> row â which can be slow; also due to network latency of each query request.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Solution 3</strong></p>

<p>Both tables are queried onceâ¦</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM item;
SELECT * FROM item_tag;
</code></pre>

<p>â¦and the mapping of the tags to the items is done by the client.</p>

<p>Here the number of queries and the transferred data amount is the lowest possible, but additional processing effort on client side is nessesary. If just a subset of <em>item</em>s is queried, the query to select the <em>item_tag</em>s could be modified to return just the tags of the queried items.</p>

<hr>

<p>Are there any other/better possible solutions for this? What is best way to go?</p>

<p>I would prefer solutions that work with the limited database features of <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/cm_chap_SQLCommandRef.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon Redshift</a>, that has not so many fancy features, like array types.</p>

As it will run as server process 7x24, it would be fatal if the service simply remains, freezes or becomes unresponsive. </p>

<p>So finally the question is,can the IMAP IDLE feature safely be implemented in a server process, or with regard to reliability and stability, is the polling approach the better solution?</p>

<p>The code actually seems to be working -- the file is retrieved and written, and I haven't had any garbage responses get through this loop -- but the error mystifies me.  I thought it might be that on the first run-through, the file doesn't exist, so filesize is throwing this error.

<p>I use <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag inside <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag to make sure the button background and text color change while selected, because after tried to put <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag outside <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag the text color not changed when select the button, the text only change after I put the cursor into the text.</p>

<pre><code>[TABLE|head,border|{
#TEXT|TEXT|TEXT#
TEXT|TEXT|TEXT
TEXT|TEXT|TEXT

}]
</code></pre>

<p>Its from a simple self made WYSIWYG Editor, which gives the possibility to add tables. But the ""syntax"" for a table should be as simple as the one above.</p>

<p>No as there can be many of these table definitions, I need to find all with php's preg_match_all to replace them with the well known <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag in html.</p>

<p>The regex iam trying to use for is the following:</p>

<pre><code>/\[TABLE\|(.*)\|\{(.*)\}\]/si
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>\x0A</code> stays for a newline as my app is running on Linux this is enough (works fine with simpler regex).</p>

<p>I use the online regex tester on <a href=""http://www.functions-online.com/preg_match_all.html"" rel=""nofollow"">functions-online.com</a>.</p>

<p>The matches it gets are not really usefull. And if i have more than one TABLE definition like the one above, then the matches are completely useless. Because of the (.*) it covers all from starting from ""head,border"" going to the very last ""|"" character in the second TABLE definition.</p>

<p>I would like to get a list of matches giving me the complete table command one by one.</p>

I noticed that I was repeating the same pattern for each directive:  Call the JQuery UI function with a single complex object for initialization.

<p>ORIGINAL POST:
request for some guidance.</p>

<p>This tutorial helped me realize this must have to do with my DataSource/Delegate. The author builds the cell with addSubview instead of taking advantage of the Xcode prototype cell, which seems like a cool thing, so I'm trying to do it.
<a href=""http://ashfurrow.com/blog/putting-a-uicollectionview-in-a-uitableviewcell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ashfurrow.com/blog/putting-a-uicollectionview-in-a-uitableviewcell</a></p>

<p>Any criticism about my approach or failure to follow best practices is welcome. </p>

<p>Each cell in the table has a UICollectionView. Each cell in the Collection View displays an image in order of the saved ""Sequence"" string. example: ""ADKDQDJDTD"" link up to AD.png KD.png QD.png JD.png TD.png</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/GUiqT.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I have two issues I can't seem to get past.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>numberOfItemsInSection gets whacky when the number of cards is driven by the array length (return handArray.count / 2). If I place a fixed number the app will work, but not very slick.</li>
  <li>When the table first comes up, the correct cards do not display until I scroll up and down the table. It also appears the data for each CollectionView is crossing paths as the wrong cards show up when scrolling up and down rapidly.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm almost positive this has to do with how my datasource is setup.</p>

        noRefresh = true
    }

    return 1
}

override func tableView(tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {
    return timeLineData.count
}

override func tableView(tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell {

    let cell:DeckTableViewCell = tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier(""Cell"", forIndexPath: indexPath) as! DeckTableViewCell

    let deck:PFObject = timeLineData.objectAtIndex(indexPath.row) as! PFObject

    cell.collectionView.dataSource = self

    handArray = Array(sequenceTemp)

    var dateFormatter = NSDateFormatter()
    dateFormatter.dateFormat = ""(MM-dd) hh:mm:ss""
    cell.timeLabel.text = dateFormatter.stringFromDate(deck.updatedAt!)

    let layout:UICollectionViewFlowLayout = UICollectionViewFlowLayout()
    layout.itemSize = CGSizeMake(99, 140)
    layout.scrollDirection = UICollectionViewScrollDirection.Horizontal

    cell.collectionView.collectionViewLayout = layout

    return cell
}


func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {
    return handArray.count / 2
}

func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -&gt; UICollectionViewCell {

    let cell:TableCollectionViewCell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier(""Cell"", forIndexPath: indexPath) as! TableCollectionViewCell
    var bcolor : UIColor = UIColor.orangeColor()
    cell.layer.borderColor = bcolor.CGColor
    cell.layer.borderWidth = 2
    cell.layer.cornerRadius = 3

    var firstLetter: Character!
    var secondLetter: Character!

    //Building card file names from Sequence data
    if (indexPath.row * 2) + 1 &lt;= handArray.count {

        firstLetter = handArray[indexPath.row * 2]
        secondLetter = handArray[indexPath.row * 2 + 1]
        let imageNameString = ""\(firstLetter)\(secondLetter).png""
        let front = UIImage(named: imageNameString)
        cell.ImageView.backgroundColor = UIColor.orangeColor()
        cell.ImageView.image = front

    }

    return cell
}
</code></pre>

<p>DeckTableViewCell.swift</p>

<pre><code>import UIKit

class DeckTableViewCell: UITableViewCell, UITextViewDelegate {

    @IBOutlet var collectionView: UICollectionView!
    @IBOutlet var sequenceId: UIButton!
    @IBOutlet var timeLabel: UILabel!
    @IBOutlet var cardCountLabel: UILabel!

    override func awakeFromNib() {
        super.awakeFromNib()
        // Initialization code
    }

    override func setSelected(selected: Bool, animated: Bool) {
        super.setSelected(selected, animated: animated)

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>TableCollectionViewCell.swift</p>

<p>import UIKit</p>

<pre><code>class TableCollectionViewCell: UICollectionViewCell {

    @IBOutlet var ImageView: UIImageView!

}
</code></pre>

<p>For this example I set (return handArray.count / 2) to a 10 and loaded 3 sequences.
The number in the top center represents the number of cards for each row.
Notice the CollectionView does not update with the right cards, it's picking up data from the other CollectionViews. IF I add bunch more sequences to this mix, when scrolling up and down, the correct cards WILL populate SOMETIMES, but unpredictable.</p>

The obvious solution seems to be to route the HTTP requests via a UK proxy server, which I'd expect would resolve the issue, but would degrade performance a little and provide an extra point of failure (e.g. if the proxy server were blacklisted).

<p>on my localhost when I run this code </p>

<pre><code>echo date(""D, m/d/Y H:i:s a T e"");

<p>It gives this out put : <strong>Mon, 09/14/2015 00:24:36 am WEST Africa/Casablanca</strong><br>
when I should get <strong>Mon, 09/13/2015 23:24:36 pm GMT GMT</strong><br>
1 hour of difference  </p>

<p>so, when I add this code in my script nothing change <code>date_default_timezone_set('Africa/Casablanca');</code><br>
But when I replace <strong>Africa/Casablanca</strong> by <strong>GMT</strong><br>
It display the correct time like this <strong>Mon, 09/13/2015 23:24:36 am GMT GMT</strong> </p>

<p>in the free hosting it's not the same the previous code display this out put<br>
<strong>Sun, 09/13/2015 18:24:39 pm EDT America/New_York</strong>  </p>

<p>and with <strong>date_default_timezone_set('Africa/Casablanca');</strong> the time is  correct  </p>

<p><strong>Mon, 09/13/2015 23:24:36 am WEST Africa/Casablanca</strong></p>

"21392730","1","21392812","","2014-01-27 22:08:34","","1","37","<p>I have a simple table: <code>create table breaktypes (parent_id int, child_id int)</code>.  The data is basically this:</p>

<pre><code>parent_id child_id
125       1
125       3
125       19
125       3722
126       32
126       44
126       13
126       14
127       266
</code></pre>

<p>Basically a list of parent_id values with child_id values that belong to it.  I would like the data to come back in the fashion below...basically a parent_id with a comma separated list of child_id values.</p>

<pre><code>parent_id child_id_csv
125       1,3,19,3722
126       32,44,13,14
127       266
</code></pre>

<p>So I got the following and it works:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  parent_id ,
        (   SELECT    CAST(bt2.child_id AS VARCHAR(5)) + ','
            FROM      dbo.breakTypes bt2
            WHERE     bt2.parent_id = bt1.parent_id
            FOR XML PATH('')
        ) AS child_id_csv 
FROM    breaktypes bt1
GROUP BY bt1.parent_id
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to work all right, but it is super slow.  This table contains 10 million records and it takes 105 seconds to bring it back.  Versus just calling <code>select parent_id, child_id from breaktypes</code> and getting everything in 18 seconds (but at a tremendous bandwidth cost).</p>

<p>How can I speed up my query?</p>

<pre><code>$('#dataTable').handsontable( data: serverdataarray )
</code></pre>

<p>So far, so good. However, I would like to format some of the columns in the array.</p>

<p>If I have a fixed number of columns I can easyly do this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#dataTable').handsontable({
    data: serverdataarray ,
    columns: [
        { data: ""Entity"", type: 'text', renderer: orangeFF9900 },
        { data: ""Geography"", type: 'text', renderer: orangeFF9900 },
        { data: ""Description"", type: 'text', renderer: orangeFF9900 },
        { data: ""cost_month1"", type: 'numeric' },
        { data: ""cost_month1"", type: 'numeric' }
    ]
});
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is that the data sent from the server will have a varying number of columns depending on a number of factors. Thus, I would like to be able to generate the columns formating array dynamicaly on the server and send it as an array too. I.e.:</p>

<pre><code>var cols = [
        { data: ""Entity"", type: 'text', renderer: orangeFF9900 },
        { data: ""Geography"", type: 'text', renderer: orangeFF9900 },
        { data: ""Description"", type: 'text', renderer: orangeFF9900 },
        { data: ""cost_month1"", type: 'numeric' },
        { data: ""cost_month1"", type: 'numeric' }
    ]; // Strictly speaking this would be a string sent form the server, but you catch my drift

 $('#dataTable').handsontable({
    data: serverdataarray ,
    columns: cols
 });
</code></pre>

<p>However, on doing so, I end up with the following error <code>TypeError: method is not a function</code> <code>jquery.handsontable-0.9.9-full.js Line: 3028</code></p>

<p>The line in question (3028) is the return line of the following function:</p>

<pre><code>Handsontable.TableView.prototype.applyCellTypeMethod = function (methodName, td, row, col) {
    var prop = this.instance.colToProp(col)
    , cellProperties = this.instance.getCellMeta(row, col)
    , method = Handsontable.helper.getCellMethod(methodName, cellProperties[methodName]); //methodName is 'renderer' or 'editor'

    return method(this.instance, td, row, col, prop, this.instance.getDataAtRowProp(row, prop), cellProperties);
};
</code></pre>

<p>Handsontable actualy manages to render correct number of columns on screen, although they are blank, unformatted and there is only one row so I'm gessing it is infering this much form the <code>serverdataarray</code> and not <code>cols</code>.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to achive what I am looking for?</p>

<p>I am open to changing the Handsontable sourcecode if need be.</p>

<p>I also have a dropdown to select a category, to be used as an additional filter with the search.</p>

<p>My query is now: </p>

<pre><code>sessionScope.searchTerm AND Field Category="" + sessionScope.categoryname + ""
</code></pre>

<p>Everything finally works except that the category filter is finding non-exact matches, for example ""Management"" finds the documents in the categories ""Management"" but also in ""Facilities Management"". This is not acceptable.</p>

<p>I tried setting searchExactMatch=true in the View properties, but this gives a stack trace, and in the log is the error: ""GTR search error: Case sensitive parameter error.: Query is not understandable""</p>

<p>So I guess this parameter is for exact case matches instead of exact search term matches as is implied. Not what it says in the help, but OK I roll with the punches as usual.</p>

<p>If I use the ""Filter by category name"" the category filter works great with no search term, and the search seems to work OK except that the categoryFilter setting is now ignored.</p>

<p>This seems to be the common behavior, that these settings all work fine in isolation but never in combination. This is what I found for view keys as well.</p>

<p>I am now out of ideas, can anyone offer assistance?</p>

I have a netCDF4 file with multiple variables including latitude, longitude and density. I am trying to plot the variable density on a matplotlib basemap using only density values from coordinates between 35-40 N and 100-110 W.</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np

<p>I have tried extracting each of the relevant variables and compiling them into a 2d-array but I have not figured out how to select only the data I need.</p>

<p>and on the C# end I created two separate .cs file for an EntitiyClass and an AmmountConverter class:</p>

<p>EntityClass code:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Collections.ObjectModel;

    {

        }

        public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;
        private void NotifyPropertyChanged(string propertyName)
        {
            if(PropertyChanged != null)
            {
                PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the AmmountConverter class:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

            double grms = values[2] == null ? 0 : System.Convert.ToDouble(values[2]);

            return prcgrms * grms;

<p>As an example, consider the following somewhat contrived form:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>TLP</code>: <code>TableLayoutPanel</code>, with 1 row and 2 columns.</li>
<li><code>label1</code>: <code>Label</code>, contained in the left column. Set <code>Text</code> to something long, <code>AutoSize</code> to false, <code>Dock</code> to Fill.</li>
<li><code>button1</code>: Button, contained in the right column. Set <code>AutoSize</code> to true.</li>
<li>Now set the row to ""AutoSize"", the first column to ""100%"" and the second column to ""AutoSize"".</li>
<li>Finally, set the whole <code>TLP</code> to <code>AutoSize</code> true, <code>AutoSizeMode</code> to GrowAndShrink.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, the <code>TLP</code> could reasonably be resized horizontally, but WinForms doesn't seem to allow this.</p>

<p>The idea is that the form containing this TLP would grow or shrink vertically based on the width, which the user can change by resizing the window as usual.</p>

<pre><code>var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
var util = require('util');

function SimpleEE() {
    var self = this;
    self.val = false;
    EventEmitter.call(this);
}

util.inherits(SimpleEE, EventEmitter);

SimpleEE.prototype.changeVal = function() {
    self.val = !self.val;
    self.emit('valChanged', self.val);
}

SimpleEE.on('valChanged', function(newVal) {
    console.log('val was changed to ' + newVal);
});
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, I don't see the point of having the listener.  Assuming, you want the same action to take place everytime the event occurs, why wouldn't you put the listener's callback function in place of the <code>emit()</code> call?</p>

<p>The reason this is confusing to me is because I originally thought events were meant for cross-module communication; i.e. one module would be alerted when an appropriate action occurs in another module.  However, from my understanding, the emitter and the listener have to be registered under the same EventEmitter instance in order to work.</p>

<p>Thanks for helping me understand.</p>

To give some context, I am building an MVC web application as well as a PhoneGap mobile application (to be deployed to both iOS and Android) that will consume the RESTful API.  I've done a lot of research on the subject, and understand I want to go with the <em>authorization code</em> flow for my MVC app (as the client secret will be kept safe), however, it is my understanding that I must use the <em>implicit grant</em> flow for the PhoneGap application, with it being a purely client side application it is assumed it cannot hold a secret.</p>

<p>With that said, I'm still fighting over my understanding of the security implications of the implicit grant flow.  When executed in a browser, I understand it to be <em>somewhat</em> secure (by validating the redirect uri, short-lived tokens, etc).  However, because PhoneGap will execute within its own browser instance (thus returning the token via hash fragment that I will need to parse), how does this lock down the API to only my PhoneGap client?</p>

<p>What's to stop a malicious hacker from simply stealing the client_id (embedded in the HTML/JS) and build their own PhoneGap application (or any other) and simply go through the implicit authorization/authentication process, thus spoofing the ""approved"" or ""official"" PhoneGap app?  This problem does not seem specific to my API - does this mean this problem exists for all API's out there that implement the implicit flow (including the big players e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc.)?  How can I prevent this from happening, does it mean I have to deny/not implement the implicit flow?  If so, how do I consume the API <em>securely</em> from my PhoneGap application?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>For example, few lines taken from <a href=""https://github.com/mscdex/busboy"" rel=""nofollow"">Busboy</a>, the fastest multipart/form-data parser for Node.js:</p>

<pre><code>var RE_SPLIT_POSIX =

<p>Beside re-usability, is there any speed benefits doing this rather than moving the regexp inside the function? Like that:</p>

<pre><code>function splitPathPosix(filename) {

<pre><code>123456 TeamA-TeamB 1.14 4.30 7.60
(id, eventname, odds1, oddsX, odds2)
</code></pre>

<p>The PHP needs to a) check whether the row exists, b1) add it if it doesn't exist, b2) if it does exist check do the values odds1, oddsX and odds2 differ, c) if they do, update the values.</p>

<p>This is the code which does a) and b1):</p>

<pre><code>$SQL_INSERT=""INSERT IGNORE INTO oddsnavi_baby.calc (id, eventname, odds1, oddsX, odds2) VALUES ('$eventid', '$eventname', '$odds1', '$oddsX', '$odds2')"";
mysql_db_query($database_baby, $SQL_INSERT) or die(""Failed Query of "" . $SQL_INSERT);
</code></pre>

<p>How do I change this part to get the row updated if the existing values of either odds1, oddsX or odds2 are different than the ones intended to be written to the database? It would also be fine if the row would be updated if <em>any</em> value is different, as the first two won't change anyway.</p>

<p>I observed this behavior only with single precision and <code>n &gt;= 130</code>. If <code>n = 129</code>, the code works in both Python and IPython.</p>

<p>Adding <code>np.random.seed(1234)</code> after the <code>import</code>s gives the same result: IPython converges, while Python does not.</p>

<p><code>scipy.linalg.__file__ = '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/scipy/linalg/__init__.pyc'</code> in both. Despite this, I would guess that IPython and Python somehow manage to pull in different <code>LAPACK</code> versions, but how?</p>

<p>The way I noticed this oddity is that I was experimenting in IPython, and then pasting the code into a <code>*.py</code> file that I run with Python. You can imagine how confused I was for a while.</p>

<p>I have understood this article but the main problem is that I must change the code controller to select the entity manager like this:</p>

<pre><code>// All three return the ""default/db2014"" entity manager
$em = $this-&gt;get('doctrine')-&gt;getManager();

// Both of these return the ""db2015"" entity manager
$db2015Em = $this-&gt;get('doctrine')-&gt;getManager('db2015');
</code></pre>

<p>Can I set the default entity manager to don't change the controller code? or some ideas to how can i achieve it? I hope to explain well because my english is not very good.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

The main issue is that not every user has the right to download the whole set of updates so I need a way to send him only the appropiate files.
I decided to do something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Client: send user ID </li>
<li>Server: check user ID in database, send him
appropiate updates  </li>
<li>Client: receive updates</li>
</ul>

<p>At this stage I'm not focusing on security issues (authentication, encryption), I'd just like to know if there is any ready solution I could use or if I have to code this by myself. Even a partial solution would be of great help.
I'm not aware of any server side application that can handle this kind of situation but I must admit this is really not my field.</p>

<p>Last point: I need to avoid any web based solution (user logging in a website, PHP and so on) for a very long list of reasons.</p>

I've followed the answer described by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2748590/clickable-widgets-in-android"">Clickable widgets in android</a> pretty closely, however I fail to get it working.</p>

<p>I've defined three strings which are my actions:</p>

<pre><code>private String playAction = ""playService"";
private String stopAction = ""stopService"";
private String resetAction = ""resetService"";
</code></pre>

<p>Next in my <code>OnUpdate()</code> function I add the <code>setOnclickPendingIntent</code>:</p>

<pre><code> @Override
    public void onUpdate(Context context, AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager, int[] appWidgetIds) {

    remoteViews = new RemoteViews(context.getPackageName(), R.layout.widget_layout);

    remoteViews.setOnClickPendingIntent(R.id.widget_play, getPendingSelfIntent(context, playAction));
    remoteViews.setOnClickPendingIntent(R.id.widget_pause, getPendingSelfIntent(context, stopAction));
    remoteViews.setOnClickPendingIntent(R.id.widget_reset, getPendingSelfIntent(context, resetAction));

    manager = appWidgetManager;

    // Build the intent to call the service
    Intent intent = new Intent(context.getApplicationContext(), UpdateWidgetService.class);

    // Update the widgets via the service
    context.startService(intent);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>getPendingSelfIntent</code> function is defined as followed:</p>

<pre><code>protected PendingIntent getPendingSelfIntent(Context context, String action) {
    Intent intent = new Intent(context, MyWidgetProvider.class);
    intent.setAction(action);
    return PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, 0, intent, 0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However the <code>onReceive</code> function receives none of the above defined actions. I currently log all the actions of incoming intents, but the only one that passes is the <code>android.appwidget.action.APPWIDGET_UPDATE</code> action.</p>

<p>For the sake of completion, this is how I've defined the actions in my Manifest:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;receiver
        android:name=""MyWidgetProvider""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_launcher""
        android:label=""My Widget""&gt;

        &lt;meta-data
            android:name=""android.appwidget.provider""
            android:resource=""@xml/widget_info"" /&gt;

        &lt;intent-filter&gt;
            &lt;action android:name=""android.appwidget.action.APPWIDGET_UPDATE"" /&gt;
            &lt;action android:name=""playService"" /&gt;
            &lt;action android:name=""stopService"" /&gt;
            &lt;action android:name=""resetService"" /&gt;
        &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;/receiver&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've read in the Android docs that elements that are part of a collection (<code>ListView</code> etc.) cannot be set using the <code>setOnClickPendingIntent</code> function. I have my three buttons in my layout. To make sure this is not causing the error, here's what the XML looks like:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;LinearLayout
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""&gt;

The sets of characters are DNA sequences so I'm going to call them <code>seq_1</code> and <code>seq_2</code> and together they are called an <code>alignment</code>. Files look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;HEADER1
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
&gt;HEADER2
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
</code></pre>

<p>The possible characters in sequence 1 under <code>&gt;HEADER1</code> are <code>ACGTN-</code> and the possible characters in sequence 2 under <code>&gt;HEADER2</code> are <code>ACGTN-*</code>.</p>

<p>I want to analyze the sequences and return two lists of indices which I will call <code>valid</code> and <code>mismatch</code>. </p>

<p><code>valid</code> contains all (1-based) indices where positions in both sequences (the ""alignment"") are in the set <code>ACGT</code> ; <code>mismatch</code> contains all (1-based) indices where positions in the alignment are in the set <code>ACGT</code> but do not match one another. Thus <code>mismatch</code> is a subset of <code>valid</code>. </p>

<p>A final condition is that I do <strong>NOT</strong> increment the index counter at positions where sequence 1 is <code>""-""</code> because these are considered ""gaps"" in the coordinate system I am using.</p>

<p>This example shows an alignment my expected output:</p>

<pre><code>seq_1      = 'CT-A-CG'  # total length = 5 because of the two gaps
seq_2      = 'CNCTA*G'
valid      = [1,3,5]    # all indices where both sequences are in 'ACGT' without counting gaps
mismatch   = [3]        # subset of valid where alignment does not match
</code></pre>

<p>I am looking to improve my current code (below), which involves regex extraction of the sequences, zipping and enumeration of non-gap sites into a generator object and then --the main time consuming step-- for-looping through this generator and filling the two lists. I feel like there must be an array-based or <code>itertools</code> solution to this problem that would be much more efficient than a for-loop through the sequences and their index zipped together and I am looking for suggestions.</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>def seq_divergence(infile):

    re_1 = re.compile('&gt;HEADER1\n([^&gt;]+)', re.MULTILINE)
    re_2 = re.compile('&gt;HEADER2\n([^&gt;]+)', re.MULTILINE)    

    valid     = []

<p>The closest I've gotten is to parse the <code>/proc/pid/stat</code> file and read out the 6th column. This gives me a number that corresponds to the <code>st_rdev</code> of the <code>tty</code> file I'm interested in.

<p>According to <code>Effective Java</code> and the answers of above question, we should <strong>not</strong> do <code>String s = new String(""a new string"");</code>, because that will create unnecessary object.</p>

<p>I am not sure about this conclusion, because I think Java is doing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning"">automatic string interning</a>, which means for a string, anyway there is only one copy of it in the memory.</p>

<p>So let's see <code>String s = new String(""a new string"");</code>. </p>

<p><code>""a new string""</code> is already a string which has been created in the memory. </p>

<p>When I do <code>String s = new String(""a new string"");</code>, then the <code>s</code> is also <code>""a new string""</code>. So according to <code>automatic string interning</code>, <code>s</code> should be pointed to the same memory address of <code>""a new string""</code>, right?</p>

<p>Then how can we say we create unnecessary objects?</p>

<p>What I want to do is to have main and worker threads share a same map, the worker threads save data into map (in different bucket). And the main thread grep the map content periodically.</p>

<p>The code goes like:</p>

<pre><code>struct cStruct
{
    std::map&lt;string::string&gt; map1; 
    pthread_mutex_t mutex1;
    pthread_mutex_t mutex2;

    }

}

void* task(void* arg){
    struct cStruct cs = * (struct cStruct*) arg;

    while (coming data){
        if (main_thread_work){
            pthread_cond_wait(&amp;count_cond, &amp;cs.mutex1)
        }  

        pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;cs.mutex1);
        // add a new bucket to the map
        cs.map1(thread_identifier)=processed_value;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;cs.mutex1);

    }

void* main_thread_task(void* arg){

    sleep(sleep_time);
    main_thread_work = true;
    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;cs.mutex1);
    // main_thread reads the std::map
    main_thread_work = false;
    pthread_cond_broadcast(&amp;count_cond, &amp;cs.mutex1)
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;cs.mutex1);    
}
</code></pre>

<p>My questions are: </p>

<p>For map size change, I should use lock to protect the map.
But for map with certain key update, can I let different threads modify the map concurrently? (assume no two identical buckets of map will be accessed at same time)</p>

<p>For the main thread greps the map, I thought of use conditional wait to hold all the worker threads while main thread is grepping the map content, and do a pthread_cond_broadcast to wake then up. The problem is that if a worker thread is updating map while main starts to work, there will be data race.</p>

<p>Please share some ideas to help me improve my design.</p>

<p>Edit 1:
Add main_thread_task().
The thing I want to avoid is worker thread arriving pthread_cond_wait ""after"" pthread_cond_broadcast and the logic goes wrong.</p>

<p>So I false the main_thread_work before main thread broadcasts workers thread. </p>

<p>I implemented what is a correct version of f with loops and with vectorization (I know its correct because I also coded a small example of it in mathematica and they agree on all values and small examples that could be done by hand).</p>

<p>The code with loops is the following:</p>

<pre><code>function [ f, z_l1, z_l2, a_l2, a_l3 ] = f_star_loops( x, c, t1, t2)

<p>the code with vectorization using <code>pdist2</code> is the following:</p>

<p>however to a shocking (?) surprise, the vectorized code seems to be slower after I did some profiling:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zoCuE.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zoCuE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>With the vectorized code it takes <strong>47.821</strong> seconds to run f but it takes <strong>19.861</strong> with the loops version.</p>

<p>I won't lie, I am not a guru at all in MATLAB, but if someone has other suggestions of how to vectorize this to hopefully improve its speed I'd appreciate it. Maybe suggestions of other ways/functions to use instead.</p>

<p>I think the main issue is the use of computing euclidean distances between t1 and x. I was thinking of maybe using <code>bsxfun</code> and minus or something along those lines but still need to try that (instead of <code>pdist2</code>).</p>

<p>Any other ideas (or requests/question clarification, I'd be happy to respond!) will be appreciated!</p>

I will not be using it for any other website but it want to make it solid independent of the rest of the website. The website is built with ASP.NET MVC.</p>

<p>I want to include different views (month, week, day [maybe even year]). I'm planning on using different ways to present information to the users:</p>

<ul>
<li>Icons</li>
<li>Colorization (weeks, hours, periods[!])</li>
<li>Popup screens</li>

<p>The information needs to be displayed based on information contained in other (.NET) models. I want this logic to be separated correctly.</p>

<p>I'm fairly good at javascript, so I will be able to build a nice interface for dragging and dropping events on the calendar and navigating through the calendar dates. However I want the component to work without javascript too.</p>

<p><strong>Should I build this component from scratch? If so, can you name the different parts which you would create to build the component?</strong></p>

<p>Ok, IÂ´m rewritting this question <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13976546/form-border-size-and-color"">Form border size and color</a>, dont know why they closed it. I want to know how can i change the border size and color of my forms(WINFORM) and WPF windows. IÂ´m using right now Fixed Tool Window as border type. I also hide the buttons (Minimize - Maximize - Close). But the border is still thick, and i dont want to have windows theme, but a black color border. Does anybody know how to implement this? I dont need resizing.</p>

<p>Some considerations:</p>

<ul>
<li>The solution needs to be useful in both Winform and WPF.</li>
<li>The window or form needs to be moveable.</li>
<li>I wanted to change the color and size of the Window OS border for my app. But I know it uses Windows API and that can be hard.</li>
</ul>

<p>And donÂ´t vote negative if you donÂ´t understand, just ask.</p>

My system will send and receive text (e.g. HTML), PDF, Excel, Word and perhaps other binary data (e.g. images); hence many of the messages will exceed 5MB.</p>

<p>Is there a web server out there (IIS, Apache, Nginx etc.) that has an inbuilt facility (or plug-in module) to break large HTTP messages down into smaller ones below a fixed size (e.g. by using chunked transfer encoding)?</p>

<p>I am aware that for ASP.NET applications, say, it is possible to write the data out as a byte stream and flush the response buffer regularly so that no individual HTTP message is ever too large for the network.  I'm sure this is true for Java applications, too.  But my system could be written in any language, and I need this to happen for all messages regardless of content type, so I was wondering if there was a way to deal with this problem in the web server so that I can implement my solution in just one place and not have to worry about how the HTTP message was created or what type of content it is.  I don't want to have to resort to modifying application code if I don't have to, particularly since my system could potentially contain many applications and all will be faced with the same upper limit on message size.</p>

There appears to be several different technologies all specific to certain tasks. My understanding is that the following technologies do the following things. Please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

<ul>
<li>Quartz 2D: The primary library for drawing shapes, text, and images to the screen.</li>
<li>Core Graphics: this is the name of the framework that contains Quartz. This can be used as a synonym for Quartz.</li>
<li>QuartzGL: A GPU acceleration mode for Quartz that is not enabled by default and not <a href=""http://cocoawithlove.com/2011/03/mac-quartzgl-2d-drawing-on-graphics.html"">necessarily faster</a> for drawing things on the screen. </li>
<li>OpenGL: The most low level library, talk directly to the graphics card at the cost of more lines of code. More suited for 3D graphics.</li>
<li>Core Image: A library for displaying images and text, but not so much for drawing shape primitives.</li>
<li>Core Animation: A library for automatically animating objects. Apparently not suited for <a href=""http://www.evanmiller.org/notes-on-2d-graphics-mac.html"">moving large numbers of objects</a>. Nor for <a href=""http://cocoawithlove.com/2009/03/asteroids-style-game-in-coreanimation_08.html"">continuous animation of objects</a>.</li>
<li>QuickTime:  A library that apparently also does images and text in addition to video, but probably not good for drawing primitive shapes.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I would like to do is create a browser for some specific type of data. The view would not very complicated and would consist of drawing rectangles at specific locations. However, the user should be able to move around by dragging the view to the left or the right and the this movement should be fluid. Here is a example that is very close to what I'm trying to make:</p>

<p>However, I figured out a trick to work around the problem, the magic trait is the cpu affinity of the subprocesses, because all subprocesses have the same cpu affinity with their parent. But this is not perfect, because the cpu affinity can be changed deliberately too.</p>

  <p><a href=""http://example.com/test/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/test/</a></p>

<p>However, if the user forgets the trailing slash</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://example.com/test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/test</a></p>

<p>then they get redirected to</p>

<p>This makes the URLs quite ugly, and I'd like to fix it, however I don't have enough of an understanding of mod_rewrite to know what's wrong. Any chance anyone could help me?</p>

The method that i call to read/write/update the dates in the db return a Future[Option[T]].
My question is this: if i had a method that first update a document and after read the updated document i need an onComplete statement or not?
For example:</p>

<pre><code>def updatePasswordInfo(user: LoginUser,info: PasswordInfo): scala.concurrent.Future[Option[BasicProfile]] = {
    import LoginUser.passwordInfoFormat //import the formatter
    //the document query
    val query = Json.obj(""providerId"" -&gt; user.providerId,

                        )
    val newPassword = Json.obj(""passswordInfo"" -&gt; info)// the new password
    //search if the user exists and 
    val future = UserServiceLogin.update(query, newPassword) //update the document
    for {
        user &lt;- UserServiceLogin.find(query).one
    } yield user //return the new LoginUser

  }

As a result, every time I do something as simple as <code>fgetc</code>, the RTL has to acquire a lock, read a byte, and release the lock.</p>

<p>This is not good for performance.</p>

<p>What's the best way to get non-threadsafe file I/O in C and C++, so that I can manage locking myself and get better performance?</p>

<ul>
<li>MSVC provides <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xt5h2ba7.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>_fputc_nolock</code></a>, and GCC provides <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/3/unlocked%5Fstdio"" rel=""nofollow""><code>unlocked_stdio</code></a> and <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/3/flockfile"" rel=""nofollow""><code>flockfile</code></a>, but I can't find any similar functions in my compiler (CodeGear C++Builder).</li>
<li>I could use the raw Windows API, but that's not portable and I assume would be slower than an unlocked fgetc for character-at-a-time I/O.</li>
<li>I could switch to something like the <a href=""http://apr.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Apache Portable Runtime</a>, but that could potentially be a lot of work.</li>
</ul>

<p>How do others approach this?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Since a few people wondered, I had tested this before posting.  <code>fgetc</code> doesn't do system calls if it can satisfy reads from its buffer, but it does still do locking, so locking ends up taking an enormous percentage of time (hundreds of locks to acquire and release for a single block of data read from disk).  Not doing character-at-a-time I/O would be a solution, but C++Builder's <code>fstream</code> classes unfortunately use fgetc (so if I want to use <code>iostream</code> classes, I'm stuck with it), and I have a lot of legacy code that uses <code>fgetc</code> and friends to read fields out of record-style files (which would be reasonable if it weren't for locking issues).</p>

<p>If i click i get index 0, 1, 2 ..i think because each 3 items are wrapped in parent? I am new with jquery, any help appreciated. what i need is get the index of post with same class.. say post 6 = index 5.. and so on</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE
How can I get the same result if the clicked element is a child anchor in the post div and not the post div directly?</strong></p>

I built the secure web api with authentication and claim-based authorizations. One requirement is that different users can view different modules on the same template.</p>

<p>I am new to AngularJs. I did the authentication in client side with the tokens. Also, in web api, I created a service to get all the permission given a user id. The response is a list of resource(contoller)/action(method) pairs. How do I implement the correct layout based on authorization rules on client side? Does that solely rely on web api permissions response and show/hide (ng-hide/ng-show) content based on the permissions? </p>

<p>Is this a good approach? What other modules/directives do I need to look into? Such as the loader for not loading the nested route until user request the parent route.</p>

<p>To add complexity, this site also need to work in bi-lingual. I think ng-translate. I mentioned this because it may open up another discussion on whether this may favor MVC instead of AngularJs. But the preference is Angular if the above two problem can be resolved.</p>

what i want to achieve is to have a dual meaning of variable <strong>var1</strong> based on  <strong>var2</strong> is <em>set</em> or <em>cleared</em>. since <strong>var2</strong> stores binary values, I declared it as uint16_t. Is it legal to separate a variable and declare it as two different datatype (int16_t and uint16_t ). This is going to be the update in existing stack, which should work seamlessly after update.
Also i couldn't use kernel functions like set_bit and clear_bit on these parted variables <strong>var1</strong> and <strong>var2</strong>. My machine is little endian</p>

On the MSDN it <em>implies</em> this can be done with the pound sign (#):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The ""#"" custom format specifier serves as a digit-placeholder symbol.
  If the value that is being formatted has a digit in the position where

<p>But in practice that only seems to work to the right of the decimal point.  If I do this:</p>

<pre><code>String s = "" Test - "" + String.Format(""format0 = {0:0.##}, format1 = {1:#.##}, format2 = {2:##.###}"",321.2345, 321.2345, 321.2345);

<p>This logs me in alright:</p>

<pre><code> window.fbAsyncInit = function()
{
        FB.init({
            appId      : '&lt;?= APP_ID ?&gt;',
            status     : true, 
            cookie     : true,
            xfbml      : true,
            oauth      : true,
        });

    FB.Event.subscribe('auth.login', function(response)
    {alert(response);
            window.location = 'http://reviewsie.com/accounts/facebook';
        });

    };

  (function(d)
{
        var js, id = 'facebook-jssdk'; if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}
        js = d.createElement('script'); js.id = id; js.async = true;
        js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js"";
        d.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(js);
    }(document));
</code></pre>

<p>But then I click logout on my site which I kill my session to my app. Then when you click on the fb:login-button again, it just opens and closes and doesn't do anything because I'm still connected to facebook. I want it to redirect.</p>

<p>But if when I logout I also use Facebook::logoutUrl it logs me out of my app AND facebook which is not what I want.</p>

<p>Atm I'm using this to look for my names

So what do I have to add to exclude the Dog objects? (I code in Python)</p>

<p>If I cant do it this way maybe I can loop through objects and look for other names than Dog. Then iterate through the new non dog names for Cat names? Which mean what do I type to not look for Dog name? :)</p>

<pre><code># Makefile v0

tar:

<p>to be:</p>

<pre><code># Makefile v1

tar: tarfile.tar

tarfile.tar: $(shell find dir)
    tar -cf $@ dir

.PHONY: tar
</code></pre>

<p>Which seems to work for a toy example.</p>

<p>However, I can see that this might do the wrong thing, depending on the time when <code>$(shell find dir)</code> is evaluated. If there is some rule that will create or delete files in <code>dir</code> after the Makefile is parsed, this might break.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Based on @user562374's answer, I seem to have a better solution, but consider this case:</p>

<pre><code># Makefile v2

tar: tarfile.tar

tarfile.tar: dir/.dirstamp
    tar --create --exclude $&lt; --file $@ $(&lt;D)

dir/.dirstamp: .FORCE
    [ ! -e $@ -o ""$(find $(@D) -newer $@ -print -quit)"" ] &amp;&amp; touch $@

dir/a: src/a
    cp $&lt; $@

.FORCE:
.PHONY: .FORCE tar
</code></pre>

<p>Now suppose <code>src/a</code> has been changed. Since there is no dependency between <code>tarfile.tar</code> and <code>dir/a</code> (not direct nor indirect), the <code>tarfile.tar:</code> target might be evaluated before <code>dir/a:</code>, and thus <code>tarfile.tar</code> will not be up-to-date.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, my questions are: What is the best practice of dealing with such cases? Must I maintain the list of files in <code>dir</code> separately? If so what is the easiest way of doing it?</p>

<p>i honestly seem to have tried this a multitude of ways, but maybe someone knows the answer ...</p>

<p>in my movie and music database, i'm trying to search multiple fields at once, but ensure that exact matches make it to the top and that certain fields such as title and artist name have more boost.</p>

<p>here's the main portion of my query...</p>

<pre><code>""query"": {
    ""bool"": {
      ""should"": [
        {
          ""multi_match"": {
            ""type"": ""phrase_prefix"",
            ""query"": ""brave"",
            ""max_expansions"": 10,
            ""fields"": [
              ""title^3"",
              ""artists.name^2"",
              ""starring.name^2"",
              ""credits.name"",
              ""tracks^0.1""
            ]
          }
        }
      ],
      ""minimum_number_should_match"": 1
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>as you see, the query is 'brave'. it just so happens there's a movie called brave. perfect, i want it at the top - since not only is it an exact match, but the match is in the title. however, there's a popular song called 'brave' from sara bareilles which ends up on top. why?</p>

<p>i've tried every analyzer known to man, custom and otherwise, and i've tried changing the 'type' parameter to every other permutation (phrase, best_fields, cross_fields, most_fields), and it just doesn't seem to honor the fact that i'm effectively trying to either promote 'title' and 'artists.name' and 'starring.name' and DEMOTE 'tracks'.</p>

<p>is there any way i can ensure all exact matches show up at the top (especially in title, etc) followed by expansions, etc?</p>

<p>any suggestions would be helpful.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>the analyzer i'm currently using which seems to work better than others is a custom one i call 'nameAnalyzer' which is made up of a 'lowercase' filter and 'keyword' tokenizer only.</p>

<p>It's probably either due to the latest Scrapy version working slightly differently, or Yahoo's doing their authentication in a more difficult manner.</p>

<p>Here is some code that worked back in 2012:</p>

<pre><code>from scrapy.spider import BaseSpider

    def after_login(self, response):
        if ""Invalid ID or password"" in response.body:

            return

        self.log('Login successful: %s' % response.url)

<p>2) <strong>Filter</strong> - Suppose I'm returning a list of student classes... I'd like to make it so that students only see classes they enrolled in (based on username) and not the ones for that haven't yet been published.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Verify</strong> - I'm not sure if this is needed, but just in case some clever hacker finds a hole in MSFT's oData protocol, I'd like to verify the results of my Entity Framework data prior to streaming to the client.  This would apply if there is a singleton DAL, thus creating concurrency issues.  See 5:15 of <a href=""http://www.asp.net/mvc/videos/aspnet-mvc-storefront-part-15-public-code-review"" rel=""nofollow"">this video</a> for an example.</p>

4) <strong>Encrypt</strong>  - This is similar to #3, but I'd like to obfuscuate the primary key before it is sent to the client.  In one case, the PK is the social security number and I don't want that being cached, or otherwise sent downstream.  I would need to decrypt this on an oData write as well.</p>

<pre><code>First Name: (text field)
Hair Color: (color drop-down)
Description: (text area)
Salutation: (radio buttons for Mr., Mrs., Miss)
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to use the <code>label</code> tag for each label in the left column to define its connection to the appropriate control in the right column.  But If I use a radio button, the spec seems to indicate that suddenly the actual ""Salutation"" label for the form control no longer belongs in the <code>label</code> tag, but rather the options ""Mr., Mrs., etc."" go in the <code>label</code> tag.</p>

<p>I've always been a fan of accessibility and the semantic web, but this design doesn't make sense to me.  The <code>label</code> tag explicitly declares labels.  The <code>option</code> tag selection options.  How do you declare a <code>label</code> on the actual label for a set of radio buttons?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
Here is an example with code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;label for""sc""&gt;Status:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

        &lt;/select&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works great.  But unlike other form controls, radio buttons have a separate field for each value:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=""right""&gt;&lt;label for=""???""&gt;Activity:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;

<p>I've noticed that all sub-keys of [files] are arrays in the output of a good file upload while mine isn't. So I've tried the way to send multiple files using Requests (<a href=""http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#post-multiple-multipart-encoded-files"" rel=""nofollow"">POST Multiple Multipart-Encoded Files</a>)</p>

<pre><code>r=requests.post( url
               , data=payload
               , files=[('files', (os.path.basename(filename), filecontent, 'application/octet-stream'))] );
</code></pre>

<p>Without more luck.</p>

<p>I have the feeling that Requests might not be able to achieve a file upload in the expected format by the API; that would be with arrays in the sub-keys of [files]. </p>

<p>So I tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IDynamicUI
{
    event EventHandler&lt;ErrorEventArgs&gt; OnError;
    void Refresh();
}

public class ErrorEventArgs : EventArgs
{
    public string Message { get; set; }
    public Exception Error { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>but the compiler gives me errors saying that fields cannot be declared inside public interfaces.</p>

<p>Well the problem is that the pages that are supposed to implement this are hosted inside a navigation frame, employing the SL4 navigation framework. That is fine and dandy however, I also need to be able to relay events that happen within the child page (like errors) to the parent page. More over I wanted to be able to force a refresh of child pages UI based on events that occur in the parent.</p>

<p>To circumvent using reflection (to see what is the Type of the page displayed in the navigation panel) I wanted to just extract the IDynamic UI out of it. This would allow me to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class ParentPage : Page
{
    IDynamicUI selectedUI = null;

    //fires when the ChildContent frame loads a child page...
    private void ChildContentFrame_Navigated(object sender, NavigationEventArgs e)
    {
        object childPage = ChildContentFrame.Content;
        this.selectedUI = (IDynamicUI)childPage;
        this.selectedUI.OnError += new EventHandler(ChildPage_OnError);
    }

    private void ChildPage_OnError(object sender, ErrorEventArgs e)
    {
        //do my error handling here.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For all of you who are fans of MVVM/MVC... well this is not it. I do know that if an MVVM apprach was taken into making this, it would've been a lot easier, however the app was already written and I am not going to rewrite it from scratch. :(</p>

Normally this is not required as we usually just hand off an Access database or csv files and that is sufficient. However in this case I need to automate the exporting of proper XML from a dozen tables.</p>

<p>If I can do it out of SQL Server 2005, that would be preferred. However I can't for the life of me find a way to do this. I can dump out raw xml data but this is just a tag per row with attribute values. We need something that represents the structure of the tables. Access has an export in xml format that meets our needs. However I'm not sure how this can be automated. It doesn't appear to be available in any way through SQL so I'm trying to track down the necessary code to export the XML through a macro or vbscript.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Output on <a href=""http://liveworkspace.org/code/2HfkHT%2435"">LiveWorkSpace</a> Is this somehow possible?</p>

<p><strong>MOTIVATION</strong>: I want to be able to detect whether a const member function is invoked on a const object or is coming from a non-const object. The object could e.g. represent a cache and the member a view. If the cache was const, one could presumably use an optimized draw routine, whereas if the underlying data was non-const, the draw routine would need to do periodically check if the data was refreshed.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: the related <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/9890218/819272"">question</a> asks how to break the build for const objects, but I don't quite understand if the answer to that implies a definite NO for my question. If not, I want to capture the constness in a boolean for further usage. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: as was pointed out @DanielFrey, the constructor is not a good place to test for constness. What about a const member function?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Thanks everyone for correcting my initially ill-posed question and providing the various parts of the answer (constructors' ill-defined constness, rvaluedness of <code>this</code>, the contextual meaning of <code>const</code>, the -with hindsight- obvious overload trick that I had overlooked, and the const reference aliasing loophole lurking in the shadows). For me this question was Stackoverflow at its best. I decided to select @JonathanWakely's answer because it showed how to define <code>Mutable</code> and <code>Immutable</code> classes that strengthen the constness concept to achieve what I want in a foolproof way.</p>

<p>""shoot rays, find the first obstacle to cut it""</p>

<p>""shoot secondary rays...""</p>

<p>""or, do it reverse and approximate/interpolate""</p>

<p>I didnt see any algortihm that uses a diffusion algorithm. Lets assume a point-light is a point that has more density than other cells(all space is divided into cells), every step/iteration of lighting/tracing makes that source point to diffuse into neighbours using a velocity field and than their neighbours and continues like that. After some satisfactory iterations(such as 30-40 iterations), the density info of each cell is used for enlightment of objects in that cell.</p>

<p>Point light and velocity field:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pRH1f.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>But it has to be a like 1000x1000x1000 size and this would take too much time and memory to compute. Maybe just computing 10x10x10 and when finding an obstacle, partitioning that area to 100x100x100(in a dynamic kd-tree fashion) can help generating lighting/shadows for acceptable resolution? Especially for vertex-based illumination rather than triangle.</p>

<p>Has anyone tried this approach?</p>

<p>Note: Velocity field is here to make light diffuse to outwards mostly(not %100 but %99 to have some global illumination). Finite-element-method can make this embarassingly-parallel.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: any object that is hit by a positive-density  will be an obstacle to generate a new velocity field around the surface of it. So light cannot go through that object but can be mirrored to another direction.(if it is a lens object than light diffuse harder through it) So the reflection of light can affect other objects with a higher iteration limit</strong></p>

<p>Same kd-tree can be used in object-collision algorithms :)</p>

<p>Just to take as a grain of salt: a neural-network can be trained for advection&amp;diffusion in a  30x30x30 grid and that can be used in a ""gpu(opencl/cuda)-->neural-network ---> finite element method --->shadows"" way.</p>

I am using mxGraph libary in eclipse to build the graph and Scene Builder to edit the FXML file, but i can't make the graph to show inside the FXML file, it only works when i use JFrame. 
When i run like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class mxgraphteste extends JFrame{

public mxgraphteste(){
  mxGraph grafo = new mxGraph();
  Object parent = grafo.getDefaultParent();

  Object v1 = grafo.insertVertex(parent, null, ""Brazil"", 100, 100, 50, 40);
  Object v2 = grafo.insertVertex(parent, null, ""Soccer"", 240, 150, 50, 40);
  Object a1 = grafo.insertEdge(parent, null, ""loves"", v1, v2);

  mxGraphComponent graphComponent = new mxGraphComponent(grafo);
  getContentPane().add(graphComponent);
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    mxgraphteste frame = new mxgraphteste();
  frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
  frame.setSize(400, 320);
  frame.setVisible(true);
}

}

I found solutions using JFXPanel for Swing Applications using JavaFX, but it didn't worked on the opposite. 
Does anyone knows what i did wrong or how can i solve this?

Unfortunately, while there is plenty of documentation on how to create a controller, establish a view, and interact with a db via a model, I've not found many resources that deal with clean, and suggested development patterns.</p>

<p>Let me give a quick example:</p>

<p>My latest project has one controller, because I'm not sure if I should be making many more than that...or when I should make a new one. How exactly do I determine when a new controller is needed, along with when a new model is needed?</p>

One service uses NXTComm, which is in the Lejos PC Libraries (lejos.pc.comm.NXTComm). I've added these libraries to the project and I've added ""import lejos.pc.comm.*;"" at the top of the class but I still get the following error.</p>

The overall program records audio, and the user is able to select various modules which run analysis in real time.  My module has a few text boxes that allows the user to keep track of operating parameters. Sometimes, when a lot of modules are loaded and operating on the data simultaneously, changing one of my text boxes causes the program to choke when it tries to alert my module that there is new data.</p>

<p>The line causing the error is</p>

<pre><code>pamObservers.get(i);
</code></pre>

<p>pamObservers is an ArrayList of size 4, and my module is in index 3.  i=3 when the error occurs.  The error message is</p>

<pre><code>IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 3, Size: 4
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using the Eclipse IDE, and I've added a breakpoint for that exception so it's stopping immediately.  I look at pamObservers in the Variables view and I can see that my module is there - that index position isn't null or anything.  I can type the line in the Expressions view and it returns the name of my module.</p>

<p>I don't know how to troubleshoot this, because it seems like it should work.  The error is random - sometimes I have to change the text boxes 4 or 5 times before it occurs.  Any suggestions would be appreciated, because I've been running around in circles for almost 2 hours and I just don't know what to do.  Thanks so much.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some code generating a dynamically filled QMenu depending on some data (I will call it thisMenu). The QMenu thisMenu is created, taking some ""main"" QWidget as parent and is added to a QMenuBar within this QWidget (menuBar.addMenu(&thisMenu). Latter on, I want the user to be able of accessing thisMenu from a context menu (the user right click on some portion of the QWidget, which pops a QMenu (called contextMenu) with some actions, and the previous QMenu as a sub-menu).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I reuse the QMenu that I first created with contextMenu.addMenu(&thisMenu) I find out that, even if contextMenu pops at the right global position, thisMenu is always translated to some other position and appearing sometimes above, sometimes under contextMenu.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can test that this is linked to the parenting chain : thisMenu is not a child of contextMenu, if I create it a child of contextMenu, everything is fine. Is there a way of cleanly handling this case without recreating a QMenu similar to thisMenu, or changing the parent of thisMenu; i.e. reusing thisMenu in both QMenuBar and in some context menu/QMenu? In other what is the proper way of handling parenting chain for QMenu and sharing QMenu?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you,</p>

Does whatsapp just use an image for this? Because their text on the button is text and not an image..</p>

Problem is that let's assume I have modified a dependency which affects only app1. Now if I am building the app. 
version.h will be get changes as source code version is changed. Due to change in version.h It will change version of both app app1 and app2. 
I want to avoid changing version of the app if no dependency of the app1 is changed. </p>

so I decided to use LZO compression algorithm in vanila swap policy. 
I finally figured out where page data transfer with backing store occurs, actually it does in , but I got a Android-level problem.
there's no error or problem in kernel-level. what makes me so sure about it is that when I'm trying to change anonymous page data for arbitrary pattern, I've got fatal errors called panic in kernel level. the fact that I didn't get any errors in kernel-level proves the anonymouse page data transfer normally.
the problem is the Android-level errors. it shows some error message and all the system-related apps dead, especially system-server first. and relaunching the Launcher app and starting some initialization step again.</p>

<p>It goes like this.</p>

<ol>
<li>An ArrayList (called FullList) holds a list of Student objects.</li>
<li>A Student object has a name (as a String) and a resultslist (as an ArrayList).</li>
<li>When i receive a Result object, it comes with a name (as a String) and result (as a Integer).</li>
<li>I want to insert this Result object into the Student object's resultlist.</li>
<li>However, the student names are not defined upfront but deduced upon the receipt of a Results object.</li>
<li>That is to say, if there is no Student object in FullList, the Result object will trigger the creation of a Student object and insert itself into the Student object's resultslist.
Then the created Student object will be inserted into FullList.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have written the code below but I'm getting multiple insertions of the same tag into FullList instead of insertion of multiple results into each tag.</p>

<p>Q1: I can't figure out what's wrong! Need a mind prick from the Gurus!
Q2: I will be using the following code for up to 90,000 students. Is this a feasible way of housing student results?</p>

<pre><code>class Result {
   String name;
   int result;

   public Result(String name, int result) {
      this.name = name;
      this.result = result;
   }

   /* start - Getting hungup over this method
    *         Something is wrong here and i don't know what it is
    */
   public void setResult(ArrayList &lt;Student&gt; fullList) {

      for (Student s : fullList) {
         if (s.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(this.name)) {
            s.setResult(this);
         }
         else {         /* enters here if Student does not exist in fullList */
            Student s = new Student(this.name); /* create new student */
            s.setResult(this);                  /* insert result into Student's resultslist */
            fullList.add(s);                    /* add Student into fullList */
         }
      }
   }
   /* end */

   public String getName() {
      return this.name;
   }
}

class Student {
   String name;
   ArrayList &lt;Result&gt; resultslist;

   public Student(String name) {

   }

When I rotate to landscape I encounter an issue where I can't swipe up/down on the right portion of the screen. It seems to be the right w-h pixels which are unresponsive to touch. The collection view does draw cells properly and everything else seems normal. Also, if I begin a swipe in the working zone and go diagonally into the unresponsive area, the drag continues to work.</p>

<p>When the device is rotated, I make the following calls:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration {
    [super willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:toInterfaceOrientation duration:duration];
    _currentIndex = self.assetsCollectionView.contentOffset.y / self.assetsCollectionView.bounds.size.height;
    [self.assetsCollectionView.collectionViewLayout invalidateLayout];
}

- (void)didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)fromInterfaceOrientation{
    [super didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation:fromInterfaceOrientation];
    float y = _currentIndex * self.assetsCollectionView.bounds.size.height;
    [self.assetsCollectionView setContentOffset:CGPointMake(0, y) animated:NO];
}
</code></pre>

<p>These look fine to me, and when I comment them out completely, I get the same behavior. </p>

<p>Other details: The UICollectionView is the only UI component in my View Controller, except for a small detail label which I'm sure is not the issue.</p>

<p>I'm switching between two subclasses of UICollectionViewFlowLayout so that the cells can expand to full screen and back, but I'm experiencing the same problem no matter which layout, or even before I swap them out. One more detail is that the fullscreen layout is pageEnabled while the smaller one is not. </p>

<p>The containing UIViewController is inside a UITabController.</p>

<p>One more note: I've double checked my layout constraints to ensure there isn't funny business there either. </p>

<pre><code>-(void) injectCode:(NSString*) code intoWebView:(UIWebView*) webView withEndCode:(NSString*) endCode {
  NSString* innerhtml = [webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""document.forms[0].%@.outerHTML"", self.identifier]];
  NSString* newCode = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""document.forms[0].%@.outerHTML=%@%@%@"", self.identifier, code, innerhtml, endCode];
  [webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:newCode];
  NSLog(@""%@"", [webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:@""document.body.outerHTML""]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>which should be called like this: </p>

<pre><code>  [f injectCode:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""&lt;img src=\""%@.png\"" id=\""%@\""&gt;"", f.identifier, f.identifier] intoWebView:self.webView withEndCode:@""&lt;/img&gt;""];
</code></pre>

<p>(whereas f is an object that contains the name, identifier, etc. of that Signature8 field).
The problem is: this doesn't work. When I debug through it, I can see innerhtml filled, I can see that newCode is actually correct (to me at least) and I thought that the line that assigns outerHTML with newCode and all that should replace the whole HTML accordingly. To verify, I logged it out to the console. Yeah.. nothing changed at all.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong here? I cannot use jQuery or any other framework really, as the code should get its HTML forms from third parties and they do not have to use jQuery or anything like that.</p>

I tried to invoke the background.js inside popup.html but it doesn't have access to the DOM to extract the information to search.</p>

<p>Any help would be great.</p>

I have included the SWF files etc in the Contents folder and referenced it from my view, the flash file loads when you get to the view, great.</p>

<p>The problem occurs because the flash file references and XML file for its configuration data, and I'm getting an error accessing that XML file. I'm guessing this is because flash is looking for a relative path and is using the URL for the page, which is obviously an MVC url and so does not refer to an actual location on disk, so the XML file is not there.</p>

<p>I guess the obvious answer is the alter the flash file to look in the contents folder for the XML file, but that means re-compiling the flash, and I know very little about flash so I'd like to avoid doing that. So is there any way to get the XML file to show up in the same URL as the view, so at the moment, the page with the flash component on is located at htttp://localhost/upload/ so I guess the XML file needs to be accessible from <a href=""http://localhost/upload/flash-settings.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/upload/flash-settings.xml</a>? </p>

<p>If there's any other better way to do this, without editing the flash file, im open to that too,</p>

<pre><code>var snake={

    //The width and height of each ""segment"" of the snake (in pixels)
    size : 20,


    /*Direction that the snake's moving in

    Left=0
    Right=1
    Up=2
    Down=3*/
    direction : rand_int_between(0,3),


    /*Positions of the snake's ""segments"" (1 is the snake's head, then 2 (when it's created) will be the next segment of the snake,
    then 3 will be the next, and so on*/
    positions : {
        1 : {
            ""x"" : rand_int_between(0, 35)*snake.size, //There are 36 possible ""columns"" that the snake can be in
            ""y"" : rand_int_between(0, 23)*snake.size
        }
    },


    //Will be set to False if the game hasn't started or of it's paused
    moving : false
}

//Alert(snake.size);
</code></pre>

<p>Now this for some reason breaks my code. I've pinpointed it to when I multiply the random integer by ""snake.size"", because if I change those lines to simply multiplying it by 20 then the script works fine.</p>

<p>I'm getting the feeling that this is one of those questions where you won't be able to believe you missed it once you hear it!</p>

<p>Can someone please help because this is driving me insane, haha. I don't think I'm accessing the ""size"" property incorrectly because if I uncomment the last line of that code, and then remove the ""snake.size"" bit from the positions property, it alerts ""20"" as you'd expect.</p>

<p>Here is rand_int_between():</p>

<pre><code>function rand_int_between(min, max) { //Will include min and max
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
}

<p>I've found a couple of explanations online but I'm mostly struggling to get my head around how you would get new options to appear under the save menu that originally didn't exist (this maybe more a Windows application question), if you get what I mean.</p>

i_list = yaml.load('&amp;id1 [3, *id1]')
print i_list
# [3, [...]]
print i_list[1] is i_list
# True
</code></pre>

<p>I can also explicitly mention the python <code>list</code> type:</p>

<pre><code>i_list = yaml.load('&amp;id1 !!python/list [3, *id1]')
</code></pre>

<p>And I can also manually create that structure without parsing yaml, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>i_list = [3]
i_list.append(i_list)
</code></pre>

<p>However, the last trick won't work for tuples, or any other immutable object. To create an infinitely-nested tuple, I must use CPython's API:</p>

<pre><code>from ctypes import pythonapi
from _ctypes import PyObj_FromPtr

t = pythonapi.PyTuple_New(1)
pythonapi.PyTuple_SetItem(t, 0, t)
i_tup = PyObj_FromPtr(t)
print repr(i_tup)
# ((...),)
</code></pre>

<p>The expected yaml code for such a tuple would look like that:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;id001 !!python/tuple
- *id001
</code></pre>

<p>and indeed, this is the output of <code>yaml.dump(i_tup)</code>. However, python's yaml can't load the very same code:</p>

<pre><code>yaml.load(yaml.dump(i_tup))

ConstructorError: found unconstructable recursive node
  in ""&lt;string&gt;"", line 1, column 1:

<p>I do a test using firebug, after playing the game, the call to load_score.php and save_score.php is around 380ms (millisecond). </p>

<p>The save_score.php just a normal inserting, nothing much. The load_score.php, I use this query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT name, score
FROM `highscores`
WHERE id =1
LIMIT 0, 10

<ul>
<li>The result returns 10 rows</li>
<li>the query returns in 0.0005 seconds (tested using phpmyadmin)</li>
<li>I echoed the data back to flash. </li>
</ul>

<p>But on my game (flash), it tooks 11 seconds(count manually) to load and save the score. Why the time differences is so big?</p>

<p>Could it be the problem when Flash received php data, the process to display is slow?? </p>

<p>Are there any others reasons on why the displaying take longer time??</p>

<p>(If you need more information, please let me know)</p>

<p>Currently I am parsing this XML using <code>DocumentBuilder</code>, and I am printing this data rather rudimentarily, that is, I am parsing it like this:</p>

<pre><code> eElement.getElementsByTagName(""temperature"").item(2).getTextContent();
</code></pre>

<p>What that does is I am getting the element by the tag name <code>temperature</code>, the third item (<code>item(2)</code>), and getting the text content that way. However, I am interested in getting the content by specifying the attribute, and that is, through the <code>type</code>.</p>

<p>Is there anyway to display the content of this XML data through specifying the <code>type</code>? By specifying the <code>type</code> as <code>hourly</code>, and printing all contents under <code>&lt;name&gt;Temperature&lt;/name&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>A psuedocode of how that would work is:</p>

<pre><code>if(attributeType()==hourly){
    print all values of hourly temperature
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the application flow is as follows:</p>

<p>1- I call app delegate, which creates a navigationController and shows it.</p>

<p>2- In the root view controller, it checks if the user is logged in or not. By default (for example during the first boot) it loads view controllers as not logged in, showing only contents for not logged user. if the user is logged with Facebook account it sends requests to a server and shows the contents for logged in user. The requests start with didupdatelocation delegated method, from which it gets the current location.</p>

<p>3- there are many places in which the app asks if you want to log in. If the user gets correct login, it creates a new navigation controller, as in app delegate, and displays it. The problem is that in this way it doesn't call the method didupdatelocation, and so it doesn't get current location and doesn't make any request to server.</p>

<p>How can you suggest me to solve the problem?</p>

<p>Using MyEclipse, we were able to get the Server defined within the IDE to start/stop the Managed Server directly, having already started the Node Manager and Admin server manually prior.  However, with Eclipse and WTP, we have not been able to determine how to do the same.</p>

<p>When defining a server in Eclipse Indigo, it allows us to specify the domain, but when we start it we only get the Admin server started.  For writing and debugging applications this is useless.  What I am looking for is a means to allow me to start/stop the Managed Server and not the Admin server.  I have Google'd repeatedly to no avail as everything I have found walks me through the same process I have already performed.  Remote debugging doesn't seem like a good option.</p>

<p>Yes I know we are on an ancient version of WL.  Yes I know we really should update for numerous reasons.  Those decisions are well above my pay grade, and we have already raised our concerns with the people who have that authority.  I just need to get what I have working like I want.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
I have been searching and playing and searching some more.  Tried to simply change the ""Start script"" in the Debug Configuration to be that of the Managed Server instead of the LocalAdmin.  However, if I have the LocalAdmin started via Service or Command line, Eclipse sees this and makes the server in the Server tab as ""Running"".  Trying to start it causes the running LocalAdmin to stop and the Managed Server to start...not what I need.</p>

<p>My next thought was to do what I did in MyEclipse, which was to duplicate the Debug Config and add the appropriate VM args to start the Managed Server, but there is no place to do that as there are no config options to control the VM args.</p>

<p>Finally, I tried to add a ""Generic Server"", point it to the WebLogic JARs, but I never get an option to ""Debug"" the Generic Server.</p>

<p>I am not sure what else to try.  SOMEONE has to be other there that has debugged a Managed Server within Eclipse!  My only other thought is to turn on remote debugging.  This seems like a painful option.</p>

<p>It just seems odd that there is no option to attach to a Managed Server.  I'd have to think SOMEONE out there has done this, or needed this.  Otherwise, what's the point of offering it?</p>

<p>We have a new requirement that we thought SignalR would be able to satisfy, so we installed SignalR 2 nuget package into the project. I created a Hub and did some searching on how to implement Dependency Injection into the project and found an article that suggests creating a SignalRDependencyResolver. <a href=""http://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/signalr-20/extensibility/dependency-injection"">http://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/signalr-20/extensibility/dependency-injection</a></p>

<p>The article has you creating a kernel in the Startup.cs file that is used for registering SignalR in OWIN:</p>

<pre><code>public class Startup
{
    public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
    {

        var kernel = new StandardKernel();
        var resolver = new NinjectSignalRDependencyResolver(kernel);

        kernel.Bind&lt;IStockTicker&gt;()
            .To&lt;Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.StockTicker.StockTicker&gt;()  // Bind to StockTicker.
            .InSingletonScope();  // Make it a singleton object.

        kernel.Bind&lt;IHubConnectionContext&gt;().ToMethod(context =&gt;
            resolver.Resolve&lt;IConnectionManager&gt;().GetHubContext&lt;StockTickerHub&gt;().Clients
            ).WhenInjectedInto&lt;IStockTicker&gt;();

        var config = new HubConfiguration()
        {
            Resolver = resolver
        };

        app.MapSignalR(config);

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that this approach has me creating two different kernels and they seem to have their own set of dependencies that they know how to resolve. If I have a dependency defined in NinjectWebCommon, the Hub doesn't know how to resolve that dependency. Without exposing my kernel in NinjectWebCommon, what is the proper way to add DI into SignalR using the Ninject.MVC3 package?</p>

Basically I'm trying to collect the results of a voting app. I thought form submission would be simple so I created a Google Spreadsheet and made a form out of it. I figured I'd point the Android app to the form and then I would have all the data in the spreadsheet for later viewing. I can't get the Android app to actually fill out the form though. Here's the resources.</p>

<p><a href=""https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&amp;formkey=dDlwZzh4bGFvNFBxUmRsR0d2VTVhYnc6MQ&amp;ifq"" rel=""nofollow"">Form</a></p>

<pre><code>private void submitVote(String outcome) {
    HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();

    results.add(new BasicNameValuePair(""entry.1.single"", outcome));
    results.add(new BasicNameValuePair(""entry.2.single"", cardTwoURL));

    try {
        post.setEntity(new UrlEncodedFormEntity(results));
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
        // Auto-generated catch block
        Log.e(""YOUR_TAG"", ""An error has occurred"", e);
    }
    try {
        client.execute(post);
    } catch (ClientProtocolException e) {

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I made both the form and the spreadsheet public so feel free to mess around with it and try and get it to work yourself.</p>

<p>I get no errors from my program, no compile errors, no errors in DDMS. When I actually run the program and click the button that executes this code I can see the delay since right now this is in the UI thread, so I know it's executing it. It appears as if everything is working perfectly, but my spreadsheet doesn't update at all.</p>

<p>Any thoughts? I'm sure it's something stupid that I'm missing, but any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Here's the updated code with lots of logging and debugging stuff.</p>

<pre><code>private void submitVote(String outcome) {
    HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();
    HttpPost post = new HttpPost(""https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/formResponse?hl=en_US&amp;amp;formkey=dDlwZzh4bGFvNFBxUmRsR0d2VTVhYnc6MQ&amp;amp;ifq"");

    List&lt;BasicNameValuePair&gt; results = new ArrayList&lt;BasicNameValuePair&gt;();
    results.add(new BasicNameValuePair(""entry.0.single"", cardOneURL));
    results.add(new BasicNameValuePair(""entry.1.single"", outcome));
    results.add(new BasicNameValuePair(""entry.2.single"", cardTwoURL));

    try {
        post.setEntity(new UrlEncodedFormEntity(results));
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
        // Auto-generated catch block
        Log.e(""YOUR_TAG"", ""An error has occurred"", e);
    }
    try {
        HttpResponse httpResponse = client.execute(post);
        Log.e(""RESPONSE"", ""info: "" + httpResponse);

        BufferedReader rd = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(httpResponse.getEntity().getContent()));
        String line;
        while ((line = rd.readLine()) != null) {
        Log.i(""words"", line);   
        }

        Intent intent = new Intent(this, ReadingView.class);
        intent.putExtra(""html"", line);
        startActivity(intent);
    } catch (ClientProtocolException e) {
        // Auto-generated catch block
        Log.e(""YOUR_TAG"", ""client protocol exception"", e);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Auto-generated catch block
        Log.e(""YOUR_TAG"", ""io exception"", e);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I use ReadingView.class for something else in my app, but hijacked it for this logging purpose right now. It only has an onCreate() method, which is below.</p>

<pre><code>public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.readingview);

    WebView mWebView = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.webview);
    mWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
    //mWebView.loadUrl(getIntent().getExtras().getString(""url""));
    mWebView.loadData(getIntent().getExtras().getString(""html""), ""text/html"", ""utf-8"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also worth noting that in the DDMS it only logs one output of line. I believe this is just because the html code is returned all as one line. Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

<p>So it produces an array with latest end date time, and end of day, and picks out whichever one is earlier (sort.first), then returns the hour number, e.g. 17 in this case.</p>

<p>However, the max_by method is not finding the event with the latest end_datetime. It seems to vary depending on the order of the @s_hash_items result. But the order of @s_hash_items shouldn't matter - I just want the max value. What am I doing wrong here? Thanks.</p>

<p>database.yml</p>

<pre><code> development:
   adapter: sqlite3
   database: /db/development.sqlite3
   pool: 5
   timeout: 5000
</code></pre>

<p>Workflow as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>$ git init</li>
<li>$ add .</li>
<li>$ git commit -m ""Initial Commit""</li>
<li>$ heroku create</li>
<li>$ git push heroku master</li>
<li>$ heroku rake db:migrate</li>
</ol>

<p>...and I was off to the races, no problem.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today using Rails 3.2.2.  New very basic scaffold app, same database yml file, same workflow.  When using localhost:3000/addresses the index of addresses comes up no problem.  However, using the same workflow and step 6, heroku rake db:migrate, the rake aborted with the following error message:</p>

<pre><code>      rake aborted!
      Please install the postgresql adapter: `gem install activerecord-postgresql-adapter`  (pg is not part of the bundle. Add it to Gemfile.)
</code></pre>

<p>So I changed my gemfile to the following:</p>

<pre><code>    group :Development, :test do
      gem 'sqlite3', '1.3.5'
    end

    group :Production do
      gem 'pg', '0.13.2'
    end
</code></pre>

<p>I then did a bundle install, committed my changes via git add . and git commit -m ""Added pg"" and pushed to heroku via git push heroku master.  Next I tried heroku rake db:migrate and the table was migrated.  However, when browsing to the app the default index page works, however, when trying the route HerokuInstanceName/addresses, I get the not so helpful error: ""We're sorry, but something went wrong.""</p>

<p>Apologies for the long winded explanation, any ideas?</p>

<p>*<em>Edit2:</em>*The first route i missed typed as /address, here is the log file when I actually put in the correct route /addresses:</p>

The data is a mix of price-data from my company and price-data bought from a data-provider and since they charge per user who can access their data I need to be able to limit the access to data.</p>

<p>I have a scheme ""DATA"" which holds all price-data. I am thinking having 2 additional schemes (example: LIM_ACCESS and FULL_ACCESS) with VIEWS that is build on the DATA-scheme. example:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW LIM_ACCESS.V_PRICES AS&lt;br&gt;

I wrote converters for this.</p>

<p>The first is exporting of my string:</p>

<pre><code>bp::class_&lt;CL_StringRef8&gt;(""CL_StringRef8"", bp::init&lt;const std::string&amp;&gt;())
    .def(""CStr"", &amp;CL_StringRef8::c_str);
</code></pre>

<p>Converters are from default tutorial but with my type:</p>

<pre><code>// CL_StringRef8 â Python string --------------------------------------
struct cl_stringref8_to_python_str
{
    static PyObject* convert(CL_StringRef8 const&amp; s)
    {
        return boost::python::incref(boost::python::object(s.c_str()).ptr());
    }
};

// Python string â CL_StringRef8 --------------------------------------
struct cl_stringref8_from_python_str
{
    cl_stringref8_from_python_str()
    {
        bp::converter::registry::push_back(
            &amp;convertible,
            &amp;construct,
            boost::python::type_id&lt;CL_StringRef8&gt;()
        );
    }

    static void* convertible(PyObject* obj_ptr)
    {
        if (!PyString_Check(obj_ptr)) return 0;
        return obj_ptr;
    }

    static void construct(PyObject* obj_ptr, bp::converter::rvalue_from_python_stage1_data* data)
    {
        const char* value = PyString_AsString(obj_ptr);
        if (value == 0) bp::throw_error_already_set();
        void* storage = ((bp::converter::rvalue_from_python_storage&lt;CL_StringRef8&gt;*)data)-&gt;storage.bytes;
        new (storage) CL_StringRef8(value);
        data-&gt;convertible = storage;
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now, as I understand, I can call c++ functions from python which takes in arguments <code>CL_StringRef8</code>, but I have a code:</p>

<pre><code>print GetMyStringObject()
data = float(GetMyStringObject())

# ==&gt;

&lt;CL_StringRef object at 0x7fd15dfd9de8&gt;
TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number
</code></pre>

<p>As I understand I have to export <code>str()</code> method for the <code>CL_StringRef8</code> but I can't do that:</p>

<pre><code>bp::class_&lt;CL_StringRef8&gt;(""CL_StringRef8"", bp::init&lt;const std::string&amp;&gt;())
    .def(""CStr"", &amp;CL_StringRef8::c_str)
    .def(bp::self_ns::str(bp::self_ns::self));

<p>The message content is always in same format and left by the same computer voice with only a slight variation in content:</p>

<p>""You sold 4 cars today"" (where the 4 can be anything from 0 to 9).</p>

<p>I have be trying to set up Sphinx, but the out-of-the-box models did not work too good.</p>

<p>I then tried to write my own acoustic model and haven't had much better success yet (30% unrecognized is my best).</p>

<p>I am wondering if voice recognition might be overkill for this task since I have exactly ONE voice, an expected audio pattern and a very limited dictionary that would need to be recognized.</p>

<p>I have access to each of the ten sounds (spoken numbers) that I would need to search for in the message.</p>

<p>Is there a non-VR approach to finding sounds in an audio file (I can convert MP3 to another format if necessary).</p>

<p><strong>Update: My solution to this task follows</strong></p>

<p>After working with Nikolay directly, I learned that the answer to my original question is irrelevant since the desired results may be achieved (with 100% accuracy) using Sphinx4 and a JSGF grammar.  </p>

<p><strong>1:</strong> Since the speech in my audo files is very limited, I created a JSGF grammar (<em>salesreport.gram</em>) to describe it.  All of the information I needed to create the following grammar was available on this <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/jsgf/"" rel=""nofollow"">JSpeech Grammar Format</a> page.</p>

<pre><code>#JSGF V1.0;

grammar salesreport;

public &lt;salesreport&gt; = (&lt;intro&gt; | &lt;sales&gt; | &lt;closing&gt;)+;

&lt;intro&gt; = this is your automated automobile sales report;

&lt;sales&gt; = you sold &lt;digit&gt; cars today;

&lt;closing&gt; = thank you for using this system;

&lt;digit&gt; = zero | one | two | three | four | five | six | seven | eight | nine;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Sphinx does not support <em>JSGF tags</em> in the grammar.  If necessary, a regular expression may be used to extract specific information (the <em>number of sales</em> in my case).</p>

<p><strong>2:</strong> It is <strong>very important</strong> that your audio files are properly formatted.  The default sample rate for Sphinx is 16Khz (16Khz means there are 16000 samples collected every second).  I converted my MP3 audio files to WAV format using <a href=""http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">FFmpeg</a>.  </p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -acodec pcm_s16le -ac 1 -ar 16000 output.wav
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, FFmpeg renders this solution OS dependent.  I am still looking for a way to convert the files using Java and will update this post if/when I find it.</p>

<p>Although it was not required to complete this task, I found <a href=""http://audacity.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">Audacity</a> helpful for working with audio files.  It includes many utilities for working with the audio files (checking sample rate and bandwidth, file format conversion, etc).</p>

<p><strong>3:</strong> Since telephone audio has a maximum bandwidth (the range of frequencies included in the audio) of 8kHz, I used the Sphinx <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/US%20English%20Generic%20Acoustic%20Model/en-us-8khz.tar.gz/download"" rel=""nofollow"">en-us-8khz</a> acoustic model.</p>

<p><strong>4:</strong> I generated my dictionary, <em>salesreport.dic</em>, using <a href=""http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool.html"" rel=""nofollow"">lmtool</a> </p>

<p><strong>5:</strong> Using the files mentioned in the previous steps and the following code (modified version of Nikolay's example), my speech is recognized with 100% accuracy every time.</p>

<pre><code>public String parseAudio(File voiceFile) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException
{
    String retVal = null;
    StringBuilder resultSB = new StringBuilder();

    Configuration configuration = new Configuration();

    configuration.setAcousticModelPath(""file:acoustic_models/en-us-8khz"");
    configuration.setDictionaryPath(""file:salesreport.dic"");

    configuration.setGrammarName(""salesreport"");

    StreamSpeechRecognizer recognizer = new StreamSpeechRecognizer(configuration);
    try (InputStream stream = new FileInputStream(voiceFile))
    {

<p>The switch is just getting too big and it's ugly. I was thinking about creating an array and simply doing:</p>

<pre><code>if(in_array($action, $methodmap)){
  $methodmap[$action]();
}

<p>But not sure of how efficient that would be or if there are any other better alternatives, performance is important since this controller handles a whole lot of incoming requests.</p>

<p>The method ""setmediatype()"" is used only in the ""RGB"" version. But i wonder. On MSDN page is says that setmediatype() says what type of data that is avaiable to in input pin of the sample grabber filter. And if it possible to use the sample grabber without seting the media type, why should I set it to anything?</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<p>Do sample grabber do any type of media converting? </p>

<p>Why should I set the media type of the sample grabber? </p>

<p>If the mediatype form the cam is set to MJPG, and I set the media type to RGB24 in the samplegrabber, what happens?</p>

<p>Could there be any performance difference of using one over another? To increase the performance (fps) of the software, should I remove one of the sample grabbers? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>The 3rd party library, due to it's design, only makes one callback to the application. However, my app has a few different asynchronous tasks that it would like to do when the callback is called (for example, logging, update the UI display, call external programs).

<p>Searching ""193p"" on Stackoverflow.com did spit out a bunch of results, but they're all outdated and from 2010 or even 2009.</p>

<p>I'm working through the class materials and they are absolutely excellent. I've been trying to teach myself iOS programming for about two years now and have tried a bunch of different books... and got nowhere. Since I started this course, watching the lectures, doing the assignments, I've written a ton of code and am feeling a real sense of progress and excitement as I march forward. This beats any book I've ever tried, simply because it's an actual university course.</p>

<p>I got through Assignment 1 without much trouble and am happy with my solutions. Since I'm not a Stanford student, however, I have no way of knowing how good or even how correct my solutions really are. Assignment 2 is quite a step up in difficulty, which is welcome as I like a challenge, but I'm already a bit lost on where to even begin.</p>

<p>Is there a website anywhere that is dedicated to non-Stanford students working on this course? A forum perhaps, a collection of working solutions, a platform to discuss the assignments and give and get help?</p>

<p>As I said... googling only gave me old stuff that pertains to versions of the course from past years.</p>

<p>Ok, here is how everything is kind of set up. </p>

<p>I have a main.master page that has the following code in it. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:Panel ID=""PanelMainMaster"" runat=""server"" DefaultButton=""searchBTN""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""HomeQuickSearch""&gt;
        &lt;input id=""multiSearchStyle"" type=""text"" placeholder =""search our store"" /&gt;
        &lt;asp:Button OnClientClick=""return searchZone()"" runat=""server"" Text=""Go"" ID=""searchBTN"" /&gt;     
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/asp:Panel&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have another master page (tree) with the following code in it: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:Panel ID=""Panel2"" runat=""server"" DefaultButton=""submit""&gt;
    &lt;form name=""ZipCodeForm"" action=""/Search.cfm"" method=""get""&gt;
        &lt;div style=""margin-bottom: .25em""&gt;Search for a tree:&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""MultiSearch"" id=""MultiSearch"" size=""15"" maxlength=""50"" style=""margin-bottom: .25em""&gt;
        &lt;asp:Button Text=""Search"" runat=""server"" ID=""submit"" OnClientClick=""return search()"" /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/asp:Panel&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then, there is a custom content page created through a third party that shows up within the second master page with this code: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""TreeStyle""&gt;
    &lt;Z:CustomMessage ID=""Tree1"" MessageKey=""TreeHero"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The HTML rendered from the custom message:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id=""MultiSearch2"" type=""text"" name=""MultiSearch2"" maxlength=""50""&gt;
&lt;button id=""submit2"" name=""submit2"" type=""submit""&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The page is rendered in following flow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Main.Master</li>
<li>Tree.Master</li>
<li>Custom Message within Tree.Master</li>
</ol>

<p>The first two input textboxes handle the Enter button event click with the <code>DefaultButton</code> option on the <code>asp:Panel</code>. However, there is a third textbox and search button that is created because of the custom message within the <code>Tree.Master</code> and that CANNOT have any <code>ASP</code> in it, only <code>HTML</code>. </p>

<p>My question is, how can I handle this Enter keypress event and have it search with the value from the third textbox instead of the value from the frist or second. </p>

<p>I have tried this, but it didn't work. Not too much surprise there though. </p>

<pre><code>function search2() {
    var urlString = 'Controls/LookUp.aspx?zipcode=' + $('#MultiSearch2').val();

    window.location = urlString;

    if (e.keyCode == 13) {
        search2();

<p>Now, if I switch to a 32-bit Linux system, I don't get any of these warnings (although there two warnings about pointer-to-non-pointer conversion); but running the generation again produces only two tables. Now, other individual tables can be produced - but they don't correspond to one another at all, I would think...</p>

<p>Has anyone encountered a similar problem? Am I doing something wrong? Am I using the wrong sources somehow?</p>

<p>My question is the following:
Is the cost parameters here equivalent to the C parameter in the dual Lagrange formulation of the soft margin SVM?
If those parameters are the same, then should not we observe an increasing number of support vectors?</p>

<p>""However, it is critical here, as in any regularization scheme, that a proper value is chosen for C, the penalty factor. If it is too large, we have a high penalty for nonseparable points and we may store many support vectors and overfit. If it is too small, we may have underfitting.""
Alpaydin (2004), page 224</p>

<p>The presented example shows that the greater the cost parameter is the less support vectors we get. So what is wrong here?</p>

I believe a bst is the best way to go about this because once its in the tree you can start from the bottom and go from left, top, and right and an infix expression is made. For example, if you take the rpn expression ""5 4 +"" and start from the end, the ""+"" is the root of the tree, and the left and right nodes are 5 and 4. Then, going from left, to the top and to the right you get 5 + 4. The specifications are that I have to correctly parenthesize everything too for larger expressions; ""5 4 + 3 * 2 /"" would have to become ""((5 + 5) * 3) / 2"".</p>

<p>My infix function just prints out the tree in linear form for now. Obviously something is wrong with they way I'm trying to build the tree because ""1 5 A"" is printed out as ""A 5 5"".. actually no matter what I type it only prints out three things which is telling me its only storing a max of three things.. Anyways, programs in bad shape I feel, and I suck at C, and any help would be greatly appreciated. There's probably some obvious mistakes but my brains too fried to notice any of them. My other college classes make it hard to focus on programming.</p>

I can't use EnumProcess since the running Metro App is being run inside app container WWAHost.exe, so I can't know which of the running WWAHost.exe processes is actually running <em>my</em> Metro App.</p>

<p>In process explorer, I noticed that the Current directory of the WWAHost.exe process which is executing my Metro App is same as metro app install location. Could this be the differentiating factor between all the running app containers? If yes, what is the way to get current directory of another process?</p>

<p>To update, I have got some a solution regarding this on msdn forums. Here's the link:</p>

"14243223","1","14244692","","2013-01-09 17:42:38","","1","886","<p>I'm currently trying to write a wrapper for a USB camera that uses an unmanaged C DLL to interface. The supplied software is written in C++ using Qt, and I'm trying to integrate this camera in a C# application I've already written (the application already uses a different camera that is supplied with a C# interface). I've read a bunch about unmanaged/managed interfacing, but I still am getting stuck with this specific DLL.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble dealing with P/Invoking the DLL. I've done a bunch of reading on ways to deal with managed/unmanaged code, and it seems that since I only have the functions/parameters (and nothing else), I can't write a C++/CLI wrapper and am forced to stick to P/Invoke. If this is untrue, some help with an alternate method would be appreciated, if more efficient.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'm currently having trouble calling some (read: all) of the functions. For examples sake, let's pick this function (taken from dijSDK.h, the header file to be used when using this interface in unmanaged C++ in Qt):</p>

<pre><code>/** \brief Find cameras currently connected to the host
  *
  * \param[out]      pGuidList   List of unique identifiers of connected cameras; memory is allocated by user
  * \param[in,out]   pNumGuids   Pointer to the number of elements in pGuidList to limit the search
  * \n                           Pointer to the number of cameras found
  * \param[in]       mask        optional mask to limit the results in pGuidList
  *
  * \note
  * -    the function lists all supported cameras that are connected to the host having a driver installed
  * -    the cameras are identified by a string in a defined style:
  * \n  &lt;i&gt;[Name of the camera library resp. camera class]:[camera name]:[Serial number of the camera]&lt;/i&gt;
  * -    the optional parameter mask may be used to limit the results returned in pGuidList; 
  * \n   mask is in the same style as the results in pGuidList 
  *      therefore the results can be limited to certain camera classes, camera types,
  *      and cameras with a given serial number */

DIJSDK_EXPORT error_t DijSDK_FindCameras(DijSDK_CamGuid* pGuidList, unsigned int* pNumGuids, const DijSDK_CamGuid mask = NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>DIJSDK_EXPORT is a define as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef DIJSDK_EXPORT
 #define DIJSDK_EXPORT externC DLLEXPORT
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>And the two typedefs used in the above function:</p>

<pre><code>/// Return value of all DijSDK functions
/// \note All return values of type error_t can be casted to the enum &lt;b&gt;DijSDK_EErrorCodeList&lt;/b&gt;, see header errorlistinstall.h
typedef int error_t;

// unique DijSDK types
/// Globally unique identifier for all supported cameras. It is used to establish a relation between &lt;b&gt;physical&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;logical&lt;/b&gt; cameras.
typedef char   DijSDK_CamGuid[64];
</code></pre>

<p>So looking at the function, the user passes in an allocated string array and the number of allocated strings in that array, and the function should return a bunch of strings and the number of strings it returns. I have absolutely no idea how to implement this in C#. I've tried different <code>DllImport</code> declarations of the function, like passing pGuidList as a...</p>

<ul>
<li><code>StringBuilder</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Where the variable I passed in was initialized with <code>var = new StringBuilder(64)</code> and the <code>uint</code> passed in was just 1.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>StringBuilder[]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Where the variable I passed in was initialized with <code>var = new StringBuilder[length]</code>, where <code>length</code> was the <code>uint</code> passed to the function.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>IntPtr</code>
Where the variable I passed in was initialized with <code>Marshal.AllocCoTaskMem(64 * length * Marshal.SystemDefaultCharSize)</code>, where <code>length</code> is the same uint as above</li>
</ul>

<p>And then passed in <code>pNumGuids</code> as <code>ref uint</code>. I don't hand in an argument for <code>mask</code> since it is optional, and I don't need to use it.</p>

<p>I constantly get a <code>PInvokeStackImbalance</code> since the signature of the managed import and the unmanaged DLL don't match, but I can't figure out what the correct signature is.</p>

<p>I've got questions about all of the functions I'm dealing with, but I'll be dealing with them one at a time. The first function I use is an ""init"" function that takes in a function pointer argument and a void pointer argument for a callback and it's associated data, but I can call it with no arguments if I don't need to use the callback and that is P/Invoking just fine. The function in this question is the one I need to call after to get a list of attached devices. I think if I can get this one working, I'll be able to figure out most of the rest of the functions.</p>

<p>The SDK and documentation I'm working with isn't publicly available online from the company that supplies it. If anyone would like it to see all of the code/documentation, I can post it on a fileserver and post a link to it.</p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated! If there's anything that I left out, make sure to heckle me about it =P</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
After the help, I managed to get it working:</p>

<p>The DllImport:</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(DLL,CallingConvention=CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
        public static extern error_t DijSDK_FindCameras([Out] DijSDK_CamGuid[] pCamGuid, ref uint pNumGuids, string mask);
</code></pre>

<p>The struct to use for DijSDK_CamGuid:</p>

<pre><code>[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential,Size=64)]
public struct DijSDK_CamGuid
{
    [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.ByValArray,SizeConst=64)]
    public char[] id;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the <code>findCameras()</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>private void findCameras()
{
     uint cameralistlen = 5;
     DijSDK_CamGuid[] cameralist = new DijSDK_CamGuid[cameralistlen];
     result = Jenoptik.DijSDK_FindCameras(cameralist, ref cameralistlen, null);
}

When my calendar loads the events, before them show up on the calendar, I need to make a ajax call into a wordpress db which should return a date of a post. Each post is an event on the calendar. Depending on the response of the database, if the post date is in future time than the current time, then the calendar should show this event in an specific color, if it is past or current time it should be another different specific color. </p>

<p>So basically, before each event renders on the calendar I need to trigger an ajax call for each of them and evaluate the data returned to apply them the right color for past/current events and future events. </p>

After some experience with Vim, I decided to get into other software that shared its philosophy on efficient/speedy keyboard usage. This naturally led me to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager"">tiling window managers</a>, which allows one to efficiently manage window space, workspaces/tags, multiple screens, etc. all with keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>It seems a large majority of users of TWMs use Vim, so I was wondering why there isn't a Vim-like window manager? By this, I mean rather than use some awkwardly-placed modifiers to manage windows, there is a specific mode you must enter from which all window management is simply a keystroke away.</p>

<p>That way, you can do all your manipulation by entering, say <code>wm</code> mode, hit all your manipulations with single keystrokes, and exit <code>wm</code>. Does such a window management style exist, and if not, well why not?</p>

<p>I found similar problems here in stackoverflow, but yet I havent figured out why its behaving this way (Im new to Ajax).</p>

<p>So the problem is, when I have <code>request.open('GET','data.txt');</code> its causing the page to stay on loading mode and the console.log doesnt show anything.</p>

<p>I google around and found in stackoverflow this solution <code>request.onreadystatechange=handleStateChange;</code></p>

<p>which seems to be fixing the problem.  unfortunately it overrides the <code>request.onreadystatechange = function(){}</code>. Console works and the data.txt  content wont show on the web.</p>

<p>If I comment it out, the content shows on the web, but the page keeps loading again. </p>

<p>I figured that its something to do with readyState and that by the time it reaches 4 the responseText is empty. But how can I get it to show the content and the console.log?</p>

<p>We have a MySQL Database containing a number of products (well, 3,200 actually).

Does anyone have experience with building something similar to the Microsoft 'Mail Merge' functionality in InDesign?</p>

<p>There's also another caveat. The items in the DB have a unique serial number, which is 5 digits in length. We then have three coloured bars which are colour-coded according to the last two digits of the item's serial number. For example, the number 12345 would have the three vertical bars coloured as red, green, red (in our system, 5 represents the colour red, and 4 represents the colour green).</p>

<p>Does anyone know if this kind of functionality is available in InDesign?

<p>I have a simple WebForms project for testing concurrency.</p>

<p>I am using:</p>

<pre><code>1. Entity Framework 4.3.1 code first approach.
2. DevExpress ASP.net controls to visualize my data. Specifically an ASPXGridView control.
3. MySQL as database backend.
</code></pre>

<p>Now I am having an issue with the concurrency check.</p>

<p>Even if I am the only user editing the data, if I edit the same record twice using the DevExpress ASPXGridView I get a concurrency exception!</p>

<p>The exception I get is :
    System.Data.OptimisticConcurrencyException</p>

<h2>My Setup</h2>

<p>** Simplified here for brevity</p>

<p>My code first entity is defined something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Country
{
    //Some constructors here

    [Required, ConcurrencyCheck]       
    public virtual string LastUpdate { get; set; }

    [Required, Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.None)]        
    public virtual int CountryID { get; set; }

    //Various other data fields here    
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can see I have added a single field called LastUpdate which the concurrecny check is being tested against due to setting the [ConcurrencyCheck] attribute.</p>

<p>On my web page with the DevExpress ASPXGridView I am using an EntityDataSource to make the binding between the grid view and the entity framework. The grid view is using a popup editor. I have the following events hooked:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{            
    //Hook entity datasource to grid view
    dbgCountries.DataSource = CountriesEntityDataSource;
    dbgCountries.DataBind(); 
}          

protected void CountriesEntityDataSource_ContextCreating(object sender, EntityDataSourceContextCreatingEventArgs e)
{
    //Create and hook my DBContext class to the entity
    //datasources ObjectContext property.
    var context = new MyDBContextClass();          
    e.Context = ((IObjectContextAdapter)context ).ObjectContext;       
}

protected void dbgCountries_InitNewRow(object sender, DevExpress.Web.Data.ASPxDataInitNewRowEventArgs e)
{
    //I create a new MyDBContextClass here and use it
    //to get the next free id for the new record 
}

protected void dbgCountries_CustomErrorText(object sender, DevExpress.Web.ASPxGridView.ASPxGridViewCustomErrorTextEventArgs e)
{ 
    //My code to catch the System.Data.OptimisticConcurrencyException
    //excpetion is in here. 

    //I try to rtefresh the entity here to get the latest data from
    //database but I get an exception saying the entity is not being
    //tracked
}

protected void dbgCountries_RowValidating(object sender, DevExpress.Web.Data.ASPxDataValidationEventArgs e)
{
    //Basic validation of record update in here
}

protected void dbgCountries_RowUpdating(object sender, DevExpress.Web.Data.ASPxDataUpdatingEventArgs e)
{
    //I set the LastUpdate field (my concurrency field)
    //to the current time here 
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also have some button events hooked to test a direct concurrecny test. </p>

<p>eg  </p>

<pre><code>- Get Entity
- Update Entity
- Update DB directly with sql
- Save Entity
- Get concurrency exception as expected
</code></pre>

<p>eg</p>

<pre><code>- Get Entity
- Update Entity      
- Save Entity
- No issue.
- Get Entity again.
- Update Entity again.      
- Save Entity again.
- No issue.
</code></pre>

<p>These buttons work as expected. Only ther grid updates seem to have an issue.</p>

<p>Maybe it is because the grid needs to use ObjectContect and my entity framework classes are using DBContext?</p>

<h2>My Attempted Fixes</h2>

<p>I have scoured the internet trying to find a solution. Checked DevExpress forums, checked other posts here on StackOverflow, various posts on the internet, Microsoft MSDN articles on concurrency and I just can not work this out.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>None of the posts were as 'simple' as mine. They all had other data involved. eg a master/detail 
relashionship. custom editors. etc. I am using all inbuild DevExpress controls and just display a 
single grid view on my db table / entity.</p></li>
<li><p>Some posts suggest refreshing the entities. I tried this but get an exception saying the entity is 
not being tracked in the object state manager.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried refreshing the entity framework by destroying and recreating my object context / db 
context but somehow I still get the concurrency issue.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried refreshing using the DBContexct and also the ObjectContext. Neither worked.
(objContext.Refresh(RefreshMode.StoreWins, entity). I either get an exception as stated]
earlier sayign the entity is not being tracked, or if I tell it to refresh only non modifed
entities then nothing happens at all (no refresh, no excpetion)</p></li>
<li><p>I tried making my DBContext global but this is no good as WebForms appears to want to recreate its 
entire state and rehook its grids data context etc after every web refresh. (page loads, user 
clicks edit, user clicks ok to update)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now all of these solutions seem to takle what to do AFTER the concurrency exception. Seeing that I should not even be getting the exception in the first place I guess they would not help.</p>

<h2>Suggestions</h2>

<p>Do any of you have suggestions on how to make this work?</p>

<p>Do I have to maybe force the entity framework to refresh manually after posting data from the grid?
(I only just thought of this one now)</p>

<p>It seems a pretty simple setup I have. Maybe I am missing something very obvious. I have not worked with WebForms or EntityFramework much yet so there could be simple (and perhaps obvious) solutions I am missing?</p>

<p>Any help appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks

I managed to create my custom menu by creating a class which extends a <code>PopupScreen</code> and having my <code>MenuItem</code> as a customized <code>LabelField</code> with abstract <code>invokeAction()</code> method. I made the <code>invokeAction()</code> method as abstract to emulate the run() method of <code>MenuItem</code>. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/tLRv7.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Everything was ok but I remember something. What if my boss ask me to implement native <code>MenuItem</code>s like <strong>Switch Application</strong> and <strong>Close</strong>. I don't think implementing <strong>Close</strong> will be a problem, but the <strong>Switch Application</strong> and other native <code>MenuItem</code> like <strong>Show Keyboard</strong>, this will give me a problem. So I come up for another solution and this is my code:    </p>

<pre><code>public CustomMenu(MainScreen screen) {
        super(vfm);
        Menu menu = screen.getMenu(0);
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; menu.getSize(); i++){
            final MenuItem finalMenu = menu.getItem(i);
            vfm.add(new CustomMenuItem(finalMenu.toString(), Field.FOCUSABLE){
                protected boolean invokeAction(int action) {
                    finalMenu.run();
                    return true;
                }
            });
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This is the constructor of my <code>CustomMenu</code>. I accept an instance of <code>MainScreen</code> as my parameter to get the the lists of <code>MenuItem</code> and add it to my existing <code>CustomMenu</code>. The <code>invokeAction()</code> overridden method there is the counterpart of <code>run()</code> method of <code>MenuItem</code>. And this is the result of what I did: </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/yilu0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I managed to put those native <code>MenuItem</code> in my <code>CustomMenu</code> but the problem is when I invoke(click) those native <code>MenuItem</code>(Switch Application, Close) I got an <code>IllegalStateException</code>. Is there a way to get the implementation of those native <code>MenuItem</code>? Or a way to capture the <code>run()</code> method of <code>MenuItem</code> then invoke it in my <code>CustomMenu</code>?  </p>

<p>The reason for doing this is simply to support transitions. I've found that I can run a transition from a style applied in <code>CSS</code> to an inline one, but then I can't remove that style back to the original. Instead all of them need to be in-line. Like in the following example:</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var svg = d3.select(""svg"");

var c1 = svg.append(""circle"")
            .attr(""class"", ""red"")
            .attr(""r"", 25)
            .attr(""cx"", 50)
            .attr(""cy"", 50);

var c2 = svg.append(""circle"")
            .attr(""r"", 25)
            .attr(""cx"", 250)
            .attr(""cy"", 50)
            .style(""fill"", ""red"");

svg.selectAll(""circle"")
   .transition()
   .delay(2000)
   .duration(2000)
   .style(""fill"", ""blue"");

c1.transition()
  .delay(5000)
  .duration(2000)
  .style(""fill"", """");

c2.transition()
  .delay(5000)
  .duration(2000)
  .style(""fill"", ""red"");</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>.red { 
   fill: red;  
}</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;script src=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/3.4.11/d3.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;svg width=""500"" height=""500""&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>The circle on the left jumps straight back to red, while the one on the right transitions back.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is transition the left circle back, without having to re-define the original colour I'm using from CSS in my Javascript code.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of an elegant way to achieve this?</p>

<p>I need to create an application that allows ""admin"" users to create checklists. Each <em>checklist</em> has :many <em>items</em>. The user will be able to add and remove items from the checklist, as they so choose. (Via a gem like Cocoon, since it handles nested resources so gracefully.)</p>

<p>An example form would look something like this:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Checklist</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Item</li>
<li>Item</li>
<li>Item</li>
</ol>

<p>[Add Items +]</p>

<hr>

<p>Once a form has been created, normal users would then be able to complete/follow a checklist. Checked is good/true, Unchecked is bad/false.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Automobile</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Check Oil    [checkbox]</li>
<li>Check Tires  [checkbox]</li>
<li>Check Lights [checkbox]</li>
</ol>

<p>[Submit]</p>

<hr>

<p>This is the difficult part. One approach I have considered...</p>

<p>Create a Record model, that belongs to the Checklist model,</p>

<p><em>Checklist</em></p>

<pre><code>   class Checklist &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :records
    end
</code></pre>

<p><em>Record</em></p>

<pre><code>class Record &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :checklist
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then, serialize the results into a hash...</p>

<pre><code>class Record &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :checklist

  serialize :list_history, Hash
end
</code></pre>

<p>I would use the item.id as the key, and the user true/false input as the value. So, the stored result would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>[ 2 =&gt; true, 54 =&gt; true, 34 =&gt; false]
</code></pre>

<p>This way, users could complete a checklist many times, and then an ""admin"" could pull up the results of previous checklists. </p>

<p><strong>Issue A</strong></p>

<p>This seems like it could work, except for when ""admin"" users want to edit a checklist. If they remove an ""item"" from the checklist, even though I can remove the ""item"" from the association, the ""item"", must be kept in the database. Otherwise, if Oil has an ID of 2, and Oil is removed in an Edit, then the record's list_history hash will have [ 2 => true], which is a key that points to nowhere. I can visualize a backlog of items pilling up.</p>

<p><strong>Issue B</strong></p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is the best way to tackle this problem. I've been using rails for 2 1/2 years now, and still feel like I did on day 1. (Actually, I  I feel as though I know even less.) Maybe there is a better solution just around the corner, that I haven't thought of yet. </p>

<p>which now makes me perplex as to what is happening behind the scenes with encoding:</p>

<ul>
<li>how do I fix this without having to look for ""\ufeffOBJECTID"" in my dict?</li>
<li>why in my second attempt is python acknowledging that it reads utf-8 (unicode) data in the row but still displays it the wrong way when I print the row as a dict?</li>
<li>is that a problem with printing/storing unicode dicts in python ? Is this behavior expected for any container?</li>
</ul>

<p>can someone with more insight on encoding give me some info on what is happening behind the scenes here ? </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: also worth mentionning that in the header of the file I have declared the encoding as utf-8. (i.e. ""# -<em>- coding: utf-8 -</em>- ""), and I am running v2.7.6</p>

"17919964","1","","","2013-07-29 09:06:36","","0","404","<p>I have recently been implementing an Entity-component system for my game engine. Every entity keeps a map of components like that :</p>

<p>Component.h</p>

<pre><code>enum COMPONENT_INFO {
    COMPONENT_POSITION = 0, 
    COMPONENT_PHYSICS,
    COMPONENT_RENDERABLE
 };
</code></pre>

<p>Entity.h</p>

<pre><code>class Entity {
public:
    std::bitset&lt;NUM_COMPONENTS&gt; componentBits;
    std::map&lt;COMPONENT_INFO, Component*&gt; components;
    ..
    ..

    Component *getComponent(COMPONENT_INFO inf) {
        return components[inf];
    }
 };
</code></pre>

<p>And my System class updates every entity per frame like that :</p>

<pre><code>void update(Entity *e, float delta) { 
        PositionComponent *cmp=(PositionComponent*)e-&gt;getComponent(COMPONENT_INFO::COMPONENT_PHYSICS);
        //x += 1.0f;
        cmp-&gt;x += 1.0f;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works as intended, but I have a huge performance problem in accessing the map. When I create 10000 entities and iterate through them (the system iterates through actually), I get 80 FPS with a blue blank system(no visual effects, just plain screen). But when I comment out the access parts and only use <code>x += 1.0f;</code>, FPS increadibly increases to 1000. Like that :</p>

<pre><code>void update(Entity *e, float delta) { 
        x += 1.0f; //btw the system has a local x value.
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So the problem is simply at accessing the components through the map. What else can I use on a system like that ? Or maybe I am doing something wrong in accessing the map ? </p>

<p>Important Edit : This is just a test drive, I mean there might be lots of components per entity, not just 3. I wrote these for just testing purposes. </p>

<p>Does someone know or can come up with a way to use pure Numpy arrays and functions to draw as well as fill colored polygons on top of a numpy array grid? </p>

<p>This I think would take two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>The ability to fill the grid array with color values so that the
polygon filling could be written in one color, and the outline in
another one. What would be ideal and fastest for such a system, eg
tuples of rgb values, color name strings, etc?</li>
<li>The ability to draw and fill the inside of a polygon based on an
array of its pixel coordinates. Drawing the outline of it I think
should be pretty easy by just using the coordinates as indexes to
the grid array and setting them to the outline color values. More
difficult would be to fill the polygon. One way would be to iterate
through all pixel cell coordinates (or better yet only for the
neighboring cells of each polygon coordinate point) and test if its
coordinates are within the polygon pixel coordinates. I know there
are some simple inside-outside/biggerthan-smallerthan algorithms to
test for point in poly using regular Python, but for my purpose this
would be too slow and I am wondering if someone has the numpy skills
to set up such an advanced linked code using only the speed of the
numpy builtin functions to return True if a numpy pixel coordinate
is inside a polygon.</li>
<li>Lastly, if someone would know how to draw a line between two
pixel/grid/array coordinates by filling in all the cells in between
two pixels with a True or color value?</li>
</ol>

<p>I know this is a tall order, but I was just curious to see if anyone would know. If so, then this could make for a pretty powerful and fast Numpy-based drawing library. In the end I would like to save the grid array as an image which is easy by passing it to PIL. </p>

<p>I am aware that PIL and Aggdraw can do the polygon drawings and that this has been suggested in many similar posts, but they are not very effective when receiving a numpy array of xy polygon/line coordinates. The assumption here is that my polygon coordinates are already in a numpy array format and I want to avoid the overhead of having to copy them into lists for every drawing (when we're talking about thousands of polygons frequently). So the difference in this post is about <em>how to fill a polygon using pure Numpy.</em></p>

  In the Java programming language, unlike C, an array of char is not a String,

  character).
  A String object is immutable, that is, its contents never change, while an array of
  char has mutable elements.
  The method toCharArray in class String returns an array of characters containing
  the same character sequence as a String. The class StringBuffer implements useful
  methods on mutable arrays of characters.</p>

<p>The event pattern in <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%23"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'c#'"" rel=""tag"">c#</a> keeps the subscriber alive as long as the publisher of the event is alive. Thus, if you don't unsubscribe, you're leaking memory (well, not really leaking - but memory remains occupied unnecessarily).</p>

<p>With the event pattern causing so many problems (for beginners?), the question is: why was the decision made that the publisher keeps a strong reference to the subscriber, instead of making them independent or allowing developers to explicitly have a <code>strong</code> or <code>weak</code> modifier?</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.thrift&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;libthrift&lt;/artifactId&gt;

        &lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And so far most everything looks normal.  Browsing my dependency tree and looking at my 'effective POM' brings no surprises.  However, when I added a simple Thrift-generated Java interface (created with Thrift 0.9.1), I had a few errors where only a few classes could not be resolved.  Then I looked at my Maven dependencies, the jars included within my project, and noticed <code>libthrift-0.9.0.jar</code>.  Everywhere else that I can see has the correct version, but here we have the wrong jar.</p>

<p>Looking at my .m2 repository, I see that there are directories for both versions, and the directory for the older (incorrect) version has more stuff in it (the correct version doesn't even have a jar contained):</p>

<pre><code>~/.m2/repository/org/apache/thrift/libthrift $ ls
0.9.0/ 0.9.1/

~/.m2/repository/org/apache/thrift/libthrift $ ls 0.9.0
_maven.repositories                      libthrift-0.9.0.jar
_remote.repositories                     libthrift-0.9.0.jar.sha1
libthrift-0.9.0-javadoc.jar              libthrift-0.9.0.pom
libthrift-0.9.0-javadoc.jar.sha1         libthrift-0.9.0.pom.sha1
libthrift-0.9.0-sources.jar.lastUpdated  m2e-lastUpdated.properties

~/.m2/repository/org/apache/thrift/libthrift $ ls 0.9.1
_maven.repositories       libthrift-0.9.1.pom       libthrift-0.9.1.pom.sha1
</code></pre>

<p>I have never installed 0.9.0 or referenced it in any way, leading me to believe that it's a Maven, Eclipse, or Thrift issue.</p>

<p>So somewhere, it looks like something is referencing the wrong version, but I can't figure out where this error is happening.  I would imagine that this is easy to reproduce, although I haven't run it on anything but OS X Mavericks.</p>

<p>Aside from submitting a bug report, is there a way to resolve this in the meantime, within Eclipse/Maven, without downloading/adding the jar externally?  I should add that I'm not a Java veteran, so perhaps I missed something obvious.</p>

<p>Thanks for any insight!</p>

<p>I'm creating a program that reads from a .data file, saves each line of the file into an array list, then the user specifies the building and room number to look for, the program then searches through the whole array list (couple thousand lines) for matches, then with those matches calculates how often those rooms are used using some of the data obtained from the data file. </p>

<p>Now, the problem is that I can get up to the program searching through the array list, but it seems to be doing something incorrectly.  </p>

<p>In the data file, there are a few places in which data is entered as <code>XXXXXXXXXXXX</code> for whatever reason.  Because of this, when trying to convert said data into an integer there's a problem (for obvious reasons).  So to fix this, I made that odd <code>if</code> block right after the <code>for</code> loop so that the program would try not to do so.<br>
However, When running it, I am able to get the program to display the total duration a couple of times before it gives an error that says</p>

<p>Method createPhotoAndShowPreview(Uri.fromFile(pictureFile)); works fine, the file exists during runtime and I can use it, but when I exit the app there is no file in the gallery. I used a file manager to check if the file is deleted, but its not deleted, it exists after exiting the application, but the system doesn't recognize that it is an image.</p>

<p>Update: The photos appered in the gallery after I connected my phone to my pc. But new photos still don't appear in the gallery untill I connect and disconnect my phone to pc. rebooting the phone has the same effect.</p>

I have implemented a custom Adapter for the Spinner, which extends BaseAdapter and implements SpinnerAdapter. I did this as a custom Adapter because my Spinner has to display expanding/collapsing nodes with carats, and special checkmarks to indicate the user's choice of node within a tree to select. All of this is working fine, except when the user presses a node to select, I don't know how to dismiss the Spinner. It just hangs around until the user collapses it by pressing the top view (the button used to expand the Spinner in the first place), or by pressing the Back button. Obviously I have overlooked something in my implementation of my SpinnerAdapter, but I'm having a fit trying to discover what it is. I have custom ViewGroups being inflated within the Adapter, and some of their children have their own click handlers. Is this messing up my Spinner?</p>

<p>Note: I've replaced valid ip addressed with .</p>

<p>In both logs, I've prefixed the most relevant lines with arrows.</p>

<p>----> This seems to be where the 500 internal server error occurred, when trying to delete capture 7984. In the production.log, it's fairly clear this was a <code>DELETE</code> request on the route <code>/captures/7984</code>. On the unicorn log, why does this show up as <code>DELETE /500 HTTP/1.0 500</code>? To me, this appears to be requesting the delete the path <code>/500</code> and returning with a 500 response.</p>

<p>--------> This is where the <code>SurveySeason</code> gets deleted. In the unicorn log, it seems very clear that someone from  sent a request to <code>DELETE</code> this object explicitly. However, on the production.log all I get is <code>Completed 302 Found in 193305.5ms (ActiveRecord: 11008.7ms)</code>. Seems pretty mysterious to me. Any ideas why these events would be reported differently?</p>

<p>I'm hoping to get to the bottom of this. You help is appreciated.</p>

The thing is I need the length of those lines over the image so I know when to stop trying to extract the values. These lines should be at all angles from the center of the image. Here is a description of how the traces happen on the image</p>

<p><a href=""http://s16.postimage.org/yzxwze6tf/Screenshot_at_2012_08_29_11_26_00.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s16.postimage.org/yzxwze6tf/Screenshot_at_2012_08_29_11_26_00.png</a></p>

<p>So p is the distance of the line from the center of the image (I have to calculate the lines at all distances), t are the values extracted from the image along the line and also the angle of the line since I need the whole 360 angles.</p>

<p>So When I programmed this I found these formulas to calculate the length of the lines.</p>

<pre><code>t1y = -((Mhe - (p * cos(phi)))/sin(phi));
t1x = ((Nhe - (p * sin(phi)))/cos(phi));
t2y = ((Mhe + (p * cos(phi)))/sin(phi));
t2x = -((Nhe + (p * sin(phi)))/cos(phi));
</code></pre>

<p>On that code Mhe is half the width of the image and Nhe is half the height of the image. p is the distance of the line from the center of the image and phi is the angle. t1y t1x and t2y and t2x are the most extreme points where the line intersects the boundaries of the image so I choose one between t1x and t1y and another between t2x and t2y. If for example I choose t1x and t2y then I substract t2y from t1x (t2y-t1x) and so I get the length of the line. Here is another picture describing these values</p>

<p><a href=""http://s12.postimage.org/cw1rbdlqz/Screenshot_at_2012_08_29_11_47_06.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s12.postimage.org/cw1rbdlqz/Screenshot_at_2012_08_29_11_47_06.png</a></p>

<p>Thing is when I apply these formulas to calculate the length of those lines I get crazy numbers like, for example,</p>

<p>Angle 153, length of the line 82 (this is fine since is within the image boundaries)</p>

<p>Angle 154, length of the line -2584</p>

<p>The second one is definitely not fine since it goes outside the image boundaries and it's even negative!</p>

<p>Will someone with trigonometry knowledge help me understand why I'm getting so different values from the formulas above? and if there's an easier way to calculate the length of those lines using the angle of the line, the dimensions of the image and the distance of the line from the center of the image.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Regular:</p>

<p>Admin:</p>

<p>One of the capabilities in the admin area is you can enter any username into a textbox and login on behalf of a ""regular"" user.  So here is my issue:</p>

<ol>
<li>Admin user logs in as ""admin@yahoo.com"".</li>
<li>Admin then goes to log in on behalf of ""regularuser@yahoo.com""</li>
<li>Now the admin goes to another page in the /admin folder but instead of it working the Forms Auth now recongizes them as ""regularuser@yahoo.com""</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's my question:</p>

<p>Is there a way to have a completely different forms authentication entry for the ""/admin"" folder?  If I authenticate someone in that folder can it have a different Forms Auth cookie than the regular application?  Can it also have a different login url for regular vs. admin?</p>

In particular the application should use the landscapeViewController when the device is in landscape mode while it should use another controller (named faceUpViewController ) when the device's orientation is ""face up"". I tried doing it with two simple view controllers and it works fine. The problem happens when the landscapeViewController uses the AR controller. The view is completely white and I don't understand why. Both the two controllers are ""contained"" by a Root View Controller. I'm doing everything by coding so without nib files. Here is the code:</p>

<p><strong>RootViewController.m</strong></p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(deviceOrientationDidChange:) name:UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification object:nil];
    [[UIDevice currentDevice] beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications];
}

- (void)deviceOrientationDidChange:(NSNotification *)notification{

    UIDeviceOrientation orientation = [[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation];

    if (orientation == UIDeviceOrientationLandscapeLeft) {
        if (self.landscapeViewController.view.superview == nil) {
            if (self.landscapeViewController == nil) {
                LandscapeViewController *lvc = [[LandscapeViewController alloc] init];
                self.landscapeViewController = lvc;
                [lvc release];
            }
            [self.faceUpViewController.view removeFromSuperview];
            [self.view addSubview:self.landscapeViewController.view];
        }
    }

    if (orientation == UIDeviceOrientationFaceUp) {
        if (self.faceUpViewController.view.superview == nil) {
            if (self.faceUpViewController == nil) {
                FaceUpViewController *fvc = [[FaceUpViewController alloc] init];
                self.faceUpViewController = fvc;
                [fvc release];
            }
            [self.landscapeViewController.view removeFromSuperview];
            [self.view addSubview:self.faceUpViewController.view];

<p>User clicks to create a game, a Game Model is called in which the game is created. </p>

<p>-- What needs to happen here is some form of callback to the View Controller to confirm the game was created so that a new VC can be pushed to the screen? What is the best way to accomplish this.</p>

<p>A prompt is shown to the user to decide to create the game as follows:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)alertView:(UIAlertView *)alertView didDismissWithButtonIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex {
    NSLog(@""button %i"",buttonIndex);
    if (buttonIndex == 0) {
        // Cancel button pressed we will clear the gameNewOpponentUser to be clean
        self.gameNewOpponentuser = nil;
    } else {
        // Start Game button pressed
        [MESGameModel createNewGameWithUser:[PFUser currentUser] against:self.gameNewOpponentuser];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The game model then creates a game with Parse as follows:</p>

<pre><code>        PFObject *newGame = [PFObject objectWithClassName:@""Game""];
        [newGame setObject:[PFUser currentUser] forKey:kMESGameUser1];
        [newGame setObject:user2 forKey:kMESGameUser2];
        [newGame saveInBackgroundWithBlock:^(BOOL succeeded, NSError *error) {
            if (succeeded) {

            }
        }];
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I have a succeeded that I can use to confirm it was created correctly. However, how do I feed that is created back to the VC from the model.</p>

Kind of a redirect i want (but fast).I thought this might work in a 2 stept action: 1st, the user click on Random from my menu, then the /randompage opens,with a random link(one of my article link) on it.
2nd i want that link to open direcly(auto), no other loadind of the page needed. 
Can it be done this way ? or is there something else to it ? 
The page is completely empty. (My website is now offline due to dns change. It will be up and running in a few hours).

I've chosen UCS4 as an internal representation to simplify string processing by reusing existing codebase, as my application of interest does no tasks related to grapheme or visual cluster management, and may operate solely on codepoints, so it's affordable by now.</p>

<p>Existing application uses <code>char *</code> everywhere, so in the process I've established few types to replace <code>char *</code> used for all these cases, and no longer use <code>char *</code> explicitly:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>""plain bytes, may contain zeros and come with length""</strong>. I describe these as <code>typedef uint8_t byte_t</code> and use as <code>byte_t *foo</code>. It's a direct replacement for <code>char *</code>, to be compatible with functions accepting both <code>void *</code> and <code>char *</code>.</li>
<li><strong>""mostly null-terminated characters of Unicode string""</strong> â these are <code>typedef uint32_t ucs4char_t</code>. I handle such characters through own functions like <code>strnlen_ucs4(const ucs4char_t *s, size_t maxlen)</code>, which reimplement logic of original functions, but operate on whole UCS4 codepoints rather than 8bit chars.</li>
<li>and finally, <strong>""bytes that are part of UTF-8 encoded string, not representing particular character/codepoint, implied to be zero-terminated, to be used as opaque buffers""</strong> â I have trouble with naming this. Functionally it's the same as <code>byte_t</code>, but I want to emphasize these types serve different purposes and should not be mixed without explicit translation (despite the fact translation is no-op in this particular case). These units appear in ""borderline"" functions between Unicode world and OS/network/fs/whatever, which have a need to coerce UCS4 to OS-provided opaque zero-terminated strings (working with <code>getenv()</code>/<code>putenv()</code> as an example). I encode UCS4 into UTF8, so I can then use <code>strlen</code> or <code>strncmp</code>, which don't have to care about Unicode and <em>meaning</em> of compared contents.</li>
</ol>

<p>But I don't know if there is any official name for such small unit, so for now I call it <code>utf8byte_t</code>, and I have a feeling that it's a misnomer.</p>

<p>So, is there any name to use? If none, maybe there is better approach to what I've described?</p>

<p>Facebook sends a cookie everytime you visit it to see if you have cookies enabled, what I did was send a request to the login page of Facebook to get the cookies, then send another with the POST data. It worked this way and I successfully logged in.</p>

So I am querying a database for string. If there is only 1 result found then it is relatively easy to create an array, fill it with information, encode JSON and return that. I am confused as to when there are multiple results. The code below is what I am using but I highly doubt it is correct. I can't encode it into JSON format using my method which is what I need. If you can help at least point me in the correct direction, I would be more than grateful! Thank you!</p>

I'm able to create the numbered list, but not the one I need.
I'm using the newest nightly version of the Libraries (poi-3.12-beta1) since some of the problems concerning the functioning under Google App Engine are solved in there.
This is how my paragraph's CTP looks like:</p>

<p>... but even after changing the numId Value to 0, there was no bullets at all, and all the numbers above 1 give the same numbered list. This is how I manually changed the value of numId:</p>

<pre><code>CTDecimalNumber ctDecimalNumber = CTDecimalNumber.Factory.newInstance();
ctDecimalNumber.setVal(BigInteger.valueOf(2l));
p.getCTP().getPPr().getNumPr().setNumId(ctDecimalNumber);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm guessing it has to do something with <code>&lt;w:numPr&gt;</code>, can that be changed too?</p>

<p>On the same page <a href=""http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/gccintro/gccintro_70.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GCC INTRO</a> was explained how to enable double precision rounding on a Linux system but not how to use extended precision on other systems.

<p>auto generated by Eclipse with two tabs, and also I have created two ListFragments to be shown on each tab (also auto generated by Eclipse and I have added my codes and did not delete any overridden methods) </p>

  list1= /*gets data from db*/
  adapter = new My_A_Adapter(getActivity(),list_A);
  setListAdapter(adapter);
}


private class My_A_Adapter extends ArrayAdapter&lt;TypeA&gt;{
  private LayoutInflater inflater;
public My_A_Adapter (FragA activity){
super(activity, R.layout.myItemView, list_A)
}
@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
 if(convertView==null){
   convertView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.myItemView_A, parent, false)}
   /* defining the views as setting them by iterating over the list
      getting the data by position*/
  return convertView;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the same approach for FragB , but the <strong>FragB list get populated by android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1</strong> and not by customized myItemView</p>

<p>I think there is problem with context or some activity attributes (the Strings shown on the list are correct but the view is not mine !!)
can any one help me ? thanks</p>

<p><em><strong>FragB and its adapter is exactly the same code just where ever you see ""A"" replace with ""B""</em></strong></p>

I think it uses the interceptUrlMap defined in Config.groovy and not the annotations anyway.</p>

<p>EDIT: I succeed to extend the security tagLib and use the ""hasAccess"" method but it seems that it uses only the interceptUrlMap contained in Config.groovy and doesn't care about the annotations I put in my controllers.</p>

<p>As you may gather, @AvenirLTStd-Book is a font we use. You may notice from the trace that psych isn't being used as a gem. The first time this happened I didn't have psych as a gem, but since then I had installed it as a gem (v2.0.1) and run <code>rbenv rehash</code> and I still get the same error. </p>

<p>There's a similar question on SO that suggests I replace psych with syck, but since syck is unmaintained I'm not comfortable using it in production. I'd rather get to the root cause of this. Thanks!</p>

Especially I need the Emacs functionality <code>next-error</code>, which is typically called with C-x `, and jumps to the next LaTeX error in the document.</p>

<p>I would like to call <code>latexmk</code> either using <code>C-x compile</code> or the AUCTeX <code>C-c C-c</code>. </p>

<p>First, I set <code>latexmk</code> to use</p>

<pre><code>$pdflatex = 'pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode';
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Option 1: C-x compile</strong></p>

<p>I press <code>C-x compile</code> and type <code>latexmk -pdf foo</code>, which runs <code>pdflatex</code>. But <code>next-error</code> will not jump to the errors, even if the *compilation* buffer contains errors:</p>

<pre><code>! Paragraph ended before \author was complete.
&lt;to be read again&gt; 
                   \par 
l.48 
[...]
Compilation exited abnormally with code 12 
</code></pre>

<p>How can I automatically jump to this error in line 48?</p>

<p>Note that this question of parsing the latex output has nothing to do with <code>latexmk</code> directly. The same problem occurs when I just do <code>C-x compile pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode foo</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2: AUCTeX</strong></p>

<p>How can I set AUCTeX to call <code>latexmk -pdf</code> instead of <code>pdflatex</code> on my .tex file? Of course, I want <code>next-error</code> to work here too.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I started a <strong>bounty</strong> because if this worked it would be a great tool for many people. I consider the question answered if a solution is given that lets me easily compile my LaTeX document using <code>latexmk</code> in Emacs and jump to the errors using <code>next-error</code> (of course, the errors might be in <em>included</em> .tex files, not necessarily in the master file or the current buffer).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Thanks to Ivan (and Chris) for making AUCTeX+Latexmk work. In the meantime, I found that using <a href=""http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~beffara/soft/rubber/"">Rubber</a> to compile LaTeX is also an excellent choice. It will display error messages in the format used by <code>gcc</code> and other compilers, so it naturally works with Emacs <code>C-x compile</code>, e.g. <code>C-x compile rubber --pdf foo</code>, and the error messages are parsed correctly.</p>

<p>But, if I try to read only one file (by commenting out one of while loops and its contents), no matter which file I pick - it works fine. If I try to read the ""inf.txt"" (smaller) in both loops and store in these different arrays, it works fine as well.</p>

<p>Moreover, if I simply switch the ""whiles"" and therefore read the larger file before the smaller one, it also works!</p>

<p>I have 2 classes</p>

<pre><code>public class Person

    string LastName {get;set;}
}

<p>I am saving the list of houses in a IEnumerable List</p>

<pre><code>IEnumerable&lt;House&gt; ListHouses = GetAllHouses();
</code></pre>

<p>GetAllHouses return the list of houses from the database</p>

<p>I want to use Lamda select in LINQ in order to do the following</p>

<pre><code>var st = ListHouses .Select(h =&gt; new
{
    id = h.ID,
    Address= h.Address,
    Zip= h.ZipCode ,
    PersonFirstName = GetPersonByID(h.PersonId ).FirstName, 
    PersonLastname = GetPersonByID(h.PersonId ).lastname

});
</code></pre>

<p>Where GetPersonByID returns an object of Type <code>Person</code> that has the given ID. and then I take his first name and last name.</p>

<p>My question is this:</p>

<p>Instead of Getting the Person 2 times for the variables (personFirstName and PersonLastName) Is there a way I can get it one time and then used it. Something like</p>

<pre><code>PersonForId = GetPersonByID(h.PersonId)
PersonFirstName =  PersonLastName.FirstName,
PersonLastname = PersonLastName.lastname
</code></pre>

I would like to set pin23 as INT2 to trigger in the rising edge and with the input configured with a pull-down resistor.
This is the code of what I am trying to do:</p>

<pre><code>void EnableINT2IE()
{
    PORTBbits.RB12=1;            //RB12, pin23 is an input.
    //CNPD1bits.CN14PDE = 0;     //pull down resistor
    //CNEN1bits.CN14IE=1;        //enable change notification.
    IFS1bits.INT2IF = 0;         //clear interrupt flag.
    INTCON2bits.INT2EP =0;       //Interrupt iNT2E is on the positive edge
    IPC7bits.INT2IP =7;          //set highest interrupt priority to INT2
    IEC1bits.INT2IE=1;           //Enable INT2IE interruption
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried both with and without the two commented lines (the are intended to configure the pull down resistor).
The interrupt vector looks like this. It calls some existing functions and turns on/off a LED. </p>

<pre><code>void __attribute__((interrupt,auto_psv)) _INT2Interrupt(void) //External Interrupt 2
{
  PORTBbits.RB3 = 1;  //turn on an led,
  RafraichirPTH();    
  RafraichirE();
  LogAppend();
  SfopAppend();
  IFS1bits.INT2IF=0; //clearing INT2 bit
  PORTBbits.RB3 = 0; //turn off led 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the interrupt is never triggered (I am connecting a cable with 3.3V to the input). I am not sure  the Interrupt is properly set. </p>

<p>Normally I use Eclipse for programming. For this project I am using Qt creator. I figured out that Qt creator is using Qt for the OpenCV functions by default.
When even running a test code (see below) which just performs opening a camera and show its image. There already, it is not possible to open my camera (I am using a XIMEA xiQ). With a normal webcam it is working. In Eclipse both is working.</p>

<p>Brief summary of steps I have done so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>OpenCV is compiled with XIMEA camera support</li>
<li>I recompiled OpenCV with Qt support</li>
<li><code>make uninstall</code> for the current installation of OpenCV</li>
<li><code>make install</code> for the new XIMEA &amp; Qt support enabled installation</li>
</ol>

<p>The Result didn't change - I cannot open the camera.</p>

<p>Each item in the listview have a ""View more"" link that open a detailed fragment B for this item.</p>

<p>I'm using FragmentManager.replace() method and ""addToBackStack"". (I'm ""replacing"" and not ""adding"" because I have menu items in fragment A that I don't want to show in fragment B. I already tryed different ways with adding fragment instead removing and trying to hide menu items when opening fragment B that have worked, but ended in some other problems, so I prefer to use replace"")</p>

<p>Supose that user is seeing item 25 in the list and then open detail fragment. When the user then hit the back button, I want the user to continues viewing the list in the same position exactly.</p>

<p>This was easy to make with ""adding fragment"" instead of ""replacing"" because the fragment was never removed. When using ""replace"" the fragment is removed and then when hit back it will render again (aka, will call onCreateView again)</p>

<p>But at this point, the view is already created for the fragment because FragmentManager.remove only remove view from the view hierarchy, but don't destroy the fragment. So I ""theoretically"" can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if(view == null){
    //Create view
    view = (ViewGroup) inflater.inflate(R.layout.news_list, container, false);
}
return view;
</code></pre>

<p>But in this case it will result in an </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>java.lang.IllegalStateException: The specified child already has a
  parent. You must call removeView() on the child's parent first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, my solution was the following:</p>

<pre><code>if(view == null){
    view = (ViewGroup) inflater.inflate(R.layout.news_list, container, false);
} else {
    ((ViewGroup) view.getParent()).removeView(view);
}
return view;
</code></pre>

<p>This is working for me, but I don't know if there will be some ""hidden"" errors beyond this solution that I'm not seeing right now.</p>

<p>When a new instance of each model is created, it's given a guid until I can retrieve an ID from the server.</p>

Ideally, the class, student and grade services need access to the sync service and vice versa, so new objects can be passed to the sync service, then the sync service can update the model in it's service directly when it's managed to contact the server for an ID. If I try and inject the services into one-another, I get a circular dependency error.</p>

<p>How can I go about sharing data between these services? I'd really like to try and avoid duplicating code to synchronize the models across each individual service (that would also mean a larger number of requests)?</p>

<p>I have made an example application with three buttons one image and one video player. When pressing the buttons a video is supposed to play. This is what distinguishes the buttons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Access a video file in the same folder as the applications executable file.</li>
<li>Access a video file added to the Qt Resource file.</li>
<li>Access a video file from an external binary Qt Resource file with no compression.</li>
</ol>

<p>Only button 1. work in my application and the reason for this post is that I have run out of idea on why button 2. and 3. can not make the video play.</p>

<p>The image included in the application is an image that is packed together with a video file in the external binary Qt Resource file. This image is successfully read from the external resource file. This means that access to the external resource file is not the problem.</p>

<p>However one thing that has been asked for, is the ability to have any time a world of warcraft item name is mentioned, it converts to an item link (similar to that of ""thottbot's"")
    Now i'm pretty sure I would be able to do this if I could find a database of the items within the game, and then just use php to convert the string to a tooltip style.</p>

<p>So I guess the question there is.. Does anybody know of a database of the wow items i can utilize, or if blizz provide one themselves?</p>

<p>The other problem I have, is I have been asked to provide a ""latest loot"" window in the sidebar. Displaying who received what in the most recent raid the guild has undergone. But once again have come up with nothing whilst searching around for a source for this information. (They dont want to have to manually input each item after each raid)</p>

<p>Any idea where I can pull some of this info from?  I'm fairly confident that if I can find the info, I can convert it to the form I desire.</p>

There's two input boxes, one that takes the current grade, and another that takes a possible exam grade, and then it tells you the final grade. However, when there is no value in at least one of those boxes, it crashes. I tried to make an if statement to detect if the final value was null, but that didn't work. Here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>public void sendMessage(View view){
    Intent intent = new Intent(this, DisplayMessageActivity.class);
    EditText grade = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.grade1);
    EditText exam = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.grade2);
    String stringGrade = (grade.getText().toString());
    String stringExam = (exam.getText().toString());
    double finalResult = (Double.parseDouble(stringGrade) * .8) + (Double.parseDouble(stringExam) * 0.2);
    String finalResultString = String.valueOf(finalResult);
    if (finalResultString == null){
        finalResultString = ""0"";
    } else {
    intent.putExtra(EXTRA_MESSAGE, finalResultString);
    startActivity(intent);
}}
</code></pre>

<p>and here's the code that renders it:</p>

<pre><code>Intent intent = getIntent();
    String message = intent.getStringExtra(MainActivity.EXTRA_MESSAGE);

    TextView textView1 = new TextView(this);
    textView1.setTextSize(30);
    textView1.setText(""Your final would be "" + message);

    setContentView(textView1);
</code></pre>

<p>Just for reference, the .8 and .2 is because the current grade is weighted at 80%, and the exam is weighted at 20%. How can I make it so it won't crash when nothing is put into the boxes?</p>

<p>My F# code works fine and needs to return an F# Seq/List.</p>

<p>I tried the following code snippets which each produce errors.</p>

<ul>
<li>Return type of F# member is a type called recoveryList with type Recoveries list</li>
<li><p>Public field in class that is a class itself containing two ICollection objects</p>

<pre><code>this.field.Collection1 = recoveries

<p>Any ideas? These operations seem valid from a C# point of view and List/ResizeArray implements ICollection so... I am confused how to assign the value.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Turning on delta indexing does not remove the need for regularly running a full re-index, as otherwise the delta index itself will grow to become just as large as the core indexes, and this removes the advantage of keeping it separate. It also slows down your requests to your server that make changes to the model records.</p>

"3347666","1","3481515","","2010-07-27 20:28:28","","0","340","<p>I have a fairly simple iPhone application that I want to have run on both the iPhone and the iPad. I'd like to just have the iPad version be a bigger version of the iPhone version, scaled up or not -- I'm working on an iPad-specific version of the app that makes better use of the interface, but wanted to make sure my existing customers have something in the meantime.</p>

<p>The app is a simple tab-based application, and within each tab is a navigation controller that presents a table view, each of which can drill down a couple of layers. Everything mostly works -- I have a couple of instances of views not filling the space available, but I can fix that. My biggest problem right now is that the navigation controllers universally break when I try using them. Once I drill down a level or two, I suddenly won't be able to come back up again.</p>

<p>Let me try to explain in more detail:</p>

<p>One tab starts off with a ""year"" table view, showing all years that have entries; if you tap a year, it pushes another table view with all months in that year that have entries; if you tap a month, it pushes another table view that shows the individual entries; if you tap an entry, it pushes a view (a <code>UIWebView</code>, with some extra widgets) that shows an entry's details.</p>

<p>Each push is done with <code>[self.navigationController pushViewController: foo animated: YES]</code>. The three table view controllers I mentioned above are all created from the same nib (in fact, <em>everything</em> pushed onto a navigation controller in any tab is loaded from the same nib). Since I know there are only up to three levels of navigation, I just allocated three identical view controllers and use one, two, or three depending on how many entries there are.</p>

<p>Popping these controllers off using the ""back"" button seems to universally mess up the state of the view controller. So, if I drill down to the third view -- showing everything in a single month -- I won't be able to pop all the way back up to the first view: the back button stops working if I pop up one level.</p>

<p>Another example in another tab: it's one table view that you can tap any entry on, and a new view controller will be pushed that shows the details of that entry. If I tap an entry, tap the back button, then tap the entry again, <em>no back button appears,</em> or sometimes, the <em>text</em> that would go inside the back button appears, but no button appears!</p>

<p>This behavior happens if I try running the iPhone app in scaled mode (built with base SDK 4.0, supporting OS 3.2) or in native mode (built with base SDK 3.2). It runs without problems on the iPhone. I'm kind of at a loss here, because this stuff always ""just worked"" out of the box, mostly from the defaults that were set up back when I first created the project.</p>

<p>My programmer's instincts are telling me that I'm doing something very wrong in my view navigation, and that the iPad is just exposing it, but I can't figure out what it is.</p>

<p>Has anyone run into an issue like this, or suggest something it might be or some better way to debug what's going on?</p>

<p>In general you might need to do this when you measure a value on consecutive days for different subjects and treatments, and you want to compute the total for each subject for the first x days of measurement.</p>

<p>This is what I've come up with:</p>

<pre><code>id &lt;- c(rep(c(2,8,10,11,16,18),each=3))
count &lt;- c(6,8,6,5,6,3,6,6,6,5,6,7,6,2,0,6,1,6)
group &lt;- c(rep(c(""A"",""B"",""C""),each=6))
df &lt;- data.frame(id,count,group)

newid&lt;-c()
newcount&lt;-c()
newgroup&lt;-c()
for (i in 1:length(unique(df$""id""))) {
  newid[i] &lt;- unique(df$""id"")[i]
  newcount[i]&lt;-sum(df[df$""id""==unique(df$""id"")[i],2][1:2])
  newgroup[i] &lt;- as.character(df$""group""[df$""id""==newid[i]][1])
}

newdf&lt;-data.frame(newid,newcount,newgroup)
</code></pre>

<p>Some possible improvements/alternatives I'm not sure about:</p>

<ul>
<li>For loops vs apply functions</li>
<li>Can I create a dataframe directly inside a for loop or should I stick to creating vectors I can late assign to a dataframe?</li>

<p>As I understand it, MyClass is a type defined by an Interface.  myObject implements that, is required to in fact, thus allowing me to pass myObject to the constructor.</p>

<p>So how does Dependency Injection work in duck typing language?  Python has no Interfaces.  Is Python's DI implementation the same as Java or other statically typed languages, or a ""workaround"" type DI for scripting languages?</p>

<p>I am not sure if there is a max limit of shader programs (was not able to turn up anything with google) that can be loaded at once, but at this current time I am looking at between 10 and 20 shader programs within the app.
The app is not a game, is for graphical editing of an image. I imagine a game would use a lot more shades than that so I am not sure if this is too much overhead for the app or if it means that I am currently wasting time optimizing code that does not need to be optimized. </p>

<p>The unfortunate thing is that I'd only ever need to use anywhere between 2-6 of these shaders at any one time. I had originaly tried to design the code so it'll only load the shader programs that it needs at that specific time and delete the ones it does not, but so far it appears that I can not load a shader program on the click of a button.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shader calls should be within a GL thread that is onSurfaceChanged(), onSurfaceCreated() or onDrawFrame()</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The glCreateShader method returns 0 when I try to create a shader outside any of the above methods (on button click). I have tried calling it within a queueEvent which in theory should put it on the GL thread but it still returns 0.</p>

<p>So am I right in thinking at the moment that I need to load all 10-20 shader programs when I create my GL Surface (or put them in my draw method with other ifs around it to determine if any shader programs do need to be loaded). Is there anything wrong with doing that even though I'll only use very few of them at once?</p>

Having that, combined with the fact that at least in the case of <code>int</code> and <code>float</code> these type objects also happen to be callables that act as parsers (e.g. <code>int(""234"") == 234</code>, like Scala's <code>""234"".toInt == 234</code>), I can come up with a solution to parse, say, a matrix of either integers or floating point numbers from a text file. The only thing I have to do is configure a parameter:</p>

<pre><code> ITEM_TYPE = int  # or float
</code></pre>

<p>and I'm good to go:</p>

<pre><code> with open('matrix.dat') as f:
   matrix_data_raw = parse_raw_matrix(f.read())
 matrix = [map(ITEM_TYPE, row) for row in matrix]
</code></pre>

<p>changing the value of <code>ITEM_TYPE</code> to <code>float</code> immediately gives me a <code>list</code> of <code>list</code> of <code>float</code>s at runtime (there's no static typing but the contents of <code>matrix</code> are still strongly typed to be either <code>list[list[int]]</code> or <code>list[list[float]]</code>).</p>

<p>In Scala, I would expect the static type of <code>matrix</code> to be e.g. either <code>Matrix[Int]</code> or <code>Matrix[Double]</code> (from, say, a more general <code>type Matrix[T: Numeric] = Vector[Vector[T]]</code>). However, being a relative beginner with Scala, I'm a bit lost as to how to achieve this. There's no obvious/easy way to just switch the value of a parameter from <code>classOf[Int]</code> to <code>classOf[Double]</code>âeven if I did that and dynamically chose the parser function accordingly (which would straightforward), how would I go about changing the runtime type of <code>matrix</code> from, say, <code>Matrix[Int]</code> to <code>Matrix[Double]</code>? And what would I have to declare the static type of <code>matrix</code> to beâ<code>Matrix[Numeric]</code>?</p>

<p>Before you judge the naivetÃ© of the question, I'll admit that I'm aware that the Scala'esque solution probably requires a somewhat different approach, but I just liked the idea of starting my thoughts off of the (IMO rather elegant) Python solution.</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/mvelaga/Ed8jQ/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/mvelaga/Ed8jQ/</a></p>

<p>Esentially it limits number of ticked checkboxes, to pre defined amount before submit button can be used.
In this case we set a limit of 3.</p>

<p>2 Issues, and I have tried to contact the coder, to no avail.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>we would like to run another instance on the same webpage, whereby we can limit checkbox requirement to 2 ticks, before a user can submit a form.
So there are two instances of this script on one page, not sure how we can separate them though.
So one div has the code in the fiddle, and user can ( must ) select 3 checkboxes. etc.
Another div, has similar code but user can ( must ) select 2 checkboxes ( diff id's )</p></li>
<li><p>we would like a alert if user tries to click either of the form submit buttons, before the requisite checkboxes have been clicked.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The two divs are either or, divs. meaning user downt have to do the one div, and the other div. But can do either,</p>

<p>Any assistance appreciated.</p>

Each sensor has an own period that says how often it should get called. For example sensor1 gets called every 10sec and sensor2 every 5min. To achieve this I call </p>

<pre><code>timer.scheduleAtFixedRate(currentTask, 0, period);
</code></pre>

<p>for each <code>TimerTask</code> when the <code>Service</code> gets started.</p>

<p>In the <code>run()</code> method I call the sensor and save its value and a timestamp in the app's database.</p>

<p><strong>What the problem is:</strong></p>

<p>As long as the device is on, everything works perfectly fine. But as soon as the device goes to sleep it's really starting to act weird.</p>

<p>For example: I have one sensor scheduled to get values every 10sec. I press start and leave the device on for 30secs. This way I get 3 values every 10secs. Then I press power to put it in sleep mode for 1min and turn it on again. What I get are 6 values (as expected), but the timestamps don't fit. Between the last timestamp when the device was on and the first it went to sleep lie more than 10sec. The next few even have the same timestamp meaning the <code>run()</code> method was called multiple times within the same second. When I turn on the device every gets back to normal and works fine.</p>

<p>That means something isn't working correctly during sleep mode. I guess it <strong>must</strong> have something to do with the <code>TimerTask</code> and the <code>Timer</code>. </p>

<p><strong>Further important information:</strong></p>

<p>What can be ruled out (I guess):</p>

<ul>
<li>the way I call the system time (I even tried <code>SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()</code>, same problem)</li>
<li>the device (I tested it on my Nexus 7 (2013) and a S3 Mini, on both it failed, <strong>BUT</strong> it worked on my Nexus 4 meaning that this one does not seem to go to sleep correctly, but that's another problem I guess)</li>
<li>the external sensors (because I use a simulation instead meaning I create random values instead of calling real sensors just for testing)</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope someone can help me with this. It's really urgent. </p>

<p>Thanks a lot in advance,
kaolick</p>

"31751341","1","31751434","","2015-07-31 16:54:16","","0","55","<p>I saw some questions about the subject, but frankly i didn't quite understood.</p>

<p>What i want: I have five tables and i want to return a select with all intersections of the main table with the other 4. I'm currently doing 2 selects and then a UNION. It works great, but i guess i could improve the performance doing in a single select.</p>

<p>Here is an example of my code:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT column1 FROM tableA A
INNER JOIN table B ON A.column1 = B.column1
LEFT JOIN table D ON A.column1 = D.column1
LEFT JOIN table E A.column1 = E.column1
WHERE B.column2 IS NOT NULL
AND B.column3 = '7'
AND ( (D.column2 = 'x' OR D.column3 = 'y') OR (E.column2 = 'x' OR E.column3 = 'y') )

UNION

SELECT column1 FROM tableA A
INNER JOIN table C ON A.column1 = C.column1
LEFT JOIN table D ON A.column1 = D.column1
LEFT JOIN table E A.column1 = E.column1
WHERE C.column2 IS NOT NULL
AND C.column3 = '7'
AND ( (D.otherColumn2= 'x' OR D.otherColumn3 = 'y') OR (E.otherColumn2 = 'x' OR E.otherColumn3 = 'y') )
</code></pre>

<p>About the tables.</p>

<p>Table <strong>A</strong> have the <code>column1</code> shared with all the other tables:</p>

<pre><code>(int) column1
</code></pre>

<p>Tables <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> have the same structure as follows:</p>

<pre><code>(int) column1 | (int) column2 | (varchar) column3
</code></pre>

<p>And tables <strong>D</strong> and <strong>E</strong> also have the same structure:</p>

<pre><code>(int) column1 | (varchar) otherColumn2 | (varchar) otherColumn3
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see, both selects are pretty much the same, with the exception of the table <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong>.</p>

<p>I asked this question without the full code and @Kevin solved it. But with this extra information, and trying to follow his example, i changed the code to:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT column1 FROM tableA A
LEFT JOIN table B ON (A.column1 = B.column1
    AND C.column2 IS NOT NULL
    AND C.column3 = '7')
LEFT JOIN table C ON (A.column1 = C.column1
    AND C.column2 IS NOT NULL
    AND C.column3 = '7')
LEFT JOIN table D ON A.column1 = D.column1
    AND (D.otherColumn2 = 'x' OR D.otherColumn3 = 'y')
LEFT JOIN table E A.column1 = E.column1
    AND (E.otherColumn2 = 'x' OR E.otherColumn3 = 'y')
WHERE
    B.column1 is not null
    or c.column1 is not null
    or D.column1 is not null
    or E.column1 is not null
</code></pre>

<p>But i getting a lot of extra results. I hope i'm making myself clear here, and if not, let me know and i will update this question.</p>

When we start an activity we pass it the xml layout to use with the method call <code>setContentView(R.layout.main);</code> but is it possible to use an xml layout file to define a dynamically created ViewGroup such as LinearLayout?</p>

<p>I have a layout xml which shows a score table for a game.  Each score that is displayed on this screen needs to be dynamically added via code.  I know that it is possible within the code to create a ViewGroup for this score and populate it with all the things I need to make a single score, and then do this every time for each score, and then add them all to the existing UI structure, already defined in the xml layout.  What I would like to know is if it is possible to use another xml file to do this?</p>

<p>For example, a layout xml file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LinearLayout android:id=""@+id/top""&gt;
  &lt;LinearLayout android:id=""@+id/column_heading""/&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In another xml layout file is something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LinearLayout android:id=""@+id/row""&gt;
  &lt;TextView/&gt;
  &lt;TextView/&gt;
  &lt;TextView/&gt;
  &lt;TextView/&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Within the code I would like to do something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>LinearLayout top = (LinearLayout)findViewById(R.id.top);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; num_of_rows; i++) {
  LinearLayout row = new LinearLayout(this);
  row.setContentView(R.layout.row);  //where R.layout.row is the second layout above
  // ... dynamically change values as needed
  top.addView(row);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However <code>.setContentView(...)</code> is not a valid method of LinearLayout.  Is there another way to do this?  I know I could do it all by code, but that's rather messy and this way would seem to be very tidy and rational..</p>

A perfect example of a font that does not fit the bill is Segoe UI, which is a TrueType Microsoft font, with font styles of: Regular, Semibold, Light, Bold, Italic, and BoldItalic.  Another example is Arial which has: Regular, Narrow, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic, Narrow Bold, Narrow Bold Italic, and Narrow Italic.</p>

<p>In Windows 7 (probably vista as well, but I don't have a machine to check) when you open explorer and browse to %SystemRoot%\Fonts you will see a column called ""Font style"" which lists out all of the available styles for each font, which tells me that there is definitely a way to do this, at the very least through API calls.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I am looking to enumerate the FontFamily list, and then list out every font style for each family.  Below is sample code for listing out all of the font families, if anyone could provide assistance for listing the font styles available for each family, I would appreciate it.  If I am going about this the wrong way, I am definitely open to suggestions.</p>

<pre><code>Drawing.Text.InstalledFontCollection ifc = new Drawing.Text.InstalledFontCollection();
foreach ( FontFamily ff in ifc.Families )
{
    Console.WriteLine(ff.ToString());
    // Something like this would be nice, but AFAIK nothing similar exists

If I declare the reference to SortedMap[A,B] ""a"" to be of type Map[A,B], then map operations on ""a"" will produce a non-sorted map implementation.  </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>import scala.collection.immutable._

object Test extends App {
    val a: Map[String, String] = SortedMap[String, String](""a"" -&gt; ""s"", ""b"" -&gt; ""t"", ""c"" -&gt; ""u"", ""d"" -&gt; ""v"", ""e"" -&gt; ""w"", ""f"" -&gt; ""x"")
    println(a.getClass+"": ""+a)

    val b = a map {x =&gt; x}  // identity
    println(b.getClass+"": ""+b)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output of the above is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>class scala.collection.immutable.TreeMap: Map(a -> s, b -> t, c -> u, d -> v, e -> w, f -> x)<br>
  class scala.collection.immutable.HashMap$HashTrieMap: Map(e -> w, f -> x, a -> s, b -> t, c -> u, d -> v)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The order of key/value pairs before and after the identity transformation is not the same.  </p>

<p>The strange thing is that removing the type declaration from ""a"" makes this issue go away.  That's fine in a toy example, but makes SortedMap[A,B] unusable for passing to methods that expect Map[A,B] parameters.</p>

<p>In general, I would expect higher order functions such as ""map"" and ""filter"" to not change the fundamental properties of the collections they are applied to.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why ""map"" is behaving like this?</p>

<p>I'm an absolutely newbie in Android programming. But Ive got a school project to create a application to take a picture. After that, the picture should upload automatically to a ftp-server. </p>

<p>Now, the picture is on my mobile phone. What are the next steps to create a ftp-client in this code? Or can I just change the Save-directory? I don't really know what I should do know. I found a lot of FTP Client-Codes in the www. But no one is working. Thats the reason why I ask you. Hope someone can explain step by step how I can send the picture to a FTP-Server. Thats really important for me and my school project. </p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>I've ran into a number of difficulties using the Telerik product (which I'll save for another day), but one of the biggest issues is when multiple team members attempt to work on the model simultaneously, and try to commit their changes to TFS. The models generated by Telerik are difficult to merge and any conflicts will, more often than not, lead to time lost fixing the entity model. The only practical way to avoid these difficulties seems to be to implement a ""relay"" system, where only one person at a time can work with the model; something that isn't practical in a team development environment. </p>

so many gem are talked about on the net, rufus, sidekiq, resque, whenever , clockwwork , but i was wondering what is the best option for our need.</p>

<p>basically i have few jobs that i want to schedule on a cron basis upfront.
also, would like to have the ability to update those jobs, or add new jobs during runtime.
tried the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>rufus-scheduler : was vary simple and easy to integrate. had the ability to schedule jobs by ons startup. the problem is there is no ability to dynamically integreate with it during runtime.</li>
<li>resque - should have the ability to schedule at runtime (schedule.yml) and also to integrate with dynamically, but uses process for each worker. bad performance.</li>
<li>sidekiq - should have support all of these. but by adding also some 3rd party gem ""sidekiq-scheduler"". had few issues on the scheduler and looks like its not really supported, which might be an issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>so should we keep invest on the sidekiq-scheduler or have we missed some more mature gem that could help us making this works?</p>

<p>any help will be appriciated.</p>

<p>Suppose also, that a dependency manager is being used internally (we're using NuGet, but the same could apply to Maven) so that:</p>

<ul>
<li>ProjectA depends on Ninject and MongoDB</li>
<li>ProjectB depends on ProjectA, and log4net</li>
</ul>

<p>Projects A and B can be built independently; NuGet automatically downloads both OSS and internal dependencies from a NuGet server (ProGet in this case).</p>

<p>Suppose finally, that ProjectB depends on v1.2.3.4-SNAPSHOT of ProjectA, and that a CI server continually updates the ProjectA.1.2.3.4-SNAPSHOT package in the NuGet server. Thereby ProjectB will always be developed against the latest checked in changes of ProjectA.</p>

<p>What if related changes are required in both Project A and B? What neat and clever ways are there to do this properly? Some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Developer checks out Project A and B. Changes are made to A, built, and checked in. Developer waits for CI server to build and update the NuGet server. Changes are made to B, built, and checked in. (I dislike this as code is being checked in as part of development process.)</li>
<li>Developer checks out Project A and B, and rewires B to use A source as a dependency (instead of NuGet package ProjectA). Changes are done to both A and B. Check in is performed for both A and B together after proper testing, but developer must ensure dependency changes are not checked in.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not particularly good at this, so I think that someone will blow my ideas out of the water with something quite clever.</p>

<p><strong>Error detail</strong></p>

<p>When I access the DoSum() Method it returns the correct result. But when I try to call any method with Stream/Byte parameter then I get following error:</p>

<p><strong><em>[System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException] = {System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException: The remote server returned an error: NotFound. ---> System.Net.WebException: The remote server returned an error: NotFound. ---> System.Net.WebException: The remote server returned an error: NotFound.

<p><strong>EDIT:------------------</strong></p>

<p>When I change the Byte[] to string then it works perfectly, I am having problem with byte[] datatype as I need Stream/byte[] to upload image to server. Any Ideas?</p>

<pre><code>[MessageContract]
public class FileInfo
{
[MessageBodyMember(Order = 1)]
public string FileName;

[MessageBodyMember(Order = 2)]
public string Mode;

/*public Byte[] FileByte;*/
 public string FileByte;
}

<p>Edit: 2---------------------</p>

<p>Please check the following Screen shots, I can't set the maxReceivedMessageSize to WCF Service, if Stream content is small it's get to the Server, but not large.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""container""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        height: 500px;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This should make an image grow from 0x0 to 500x500.
In my Javascript file I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>var findAnimation = function(name) {
    for (var i in document.styleSheets) {
        var styleSheet = document.styleSheets[i];
        for (var j in styleSheet.cssRules) {

    image.style.width = ""500px"";
    image.style.height = ""500px"";

        }
    }
}

addImage(100, 100, ""http://i.imgur.com/KGfgH.jpg"");
</code></pre>

<p>â</p>

<p>When addImage() is called, I'm trying to create an image at the coordinates (x, y). The animation should make it grow while also move from the location where the image was created (x, y) to the top left corner (0, 0).</p>

<p>Instead, Chrome just crashes to the ""Aw, snap"" page. Does anyone know why this is the case?</p>

<p>EDIT: Here is an example. This crashes for me if I visit it: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/LVpWS/10/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/LVpWS/10/</a></p>

<p>In this one I commented out some lines and it does not crash: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/LVpWS/21/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/LVpWS/21/</a></p>

<p>EDIT2: It works if I switch back to Chrome 20.</p>

it is the same problem. <strong>HD2 (480x800, 190dpi) - small image</strong>, <strong>Sensation (480x800, 240dpi) - huge image</strong>.</p>

Node is a class as following:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt;
class Node {
        T* data;
        Node&lt;T&gt;* next;
        friend class Iterator&lt;T&gt;;
    public:
        Node():data(NULL),next(NULL){}
        Node(const T&amp; data):data(NULL),next(NULL){
                T* copy = new T(data);
                this-&gt;data = copy;
        }

        Node(const Node&amp; node):data(NULL),next(NULL){

            Node&lt;T&gt; dummy;
            dummy.data = node.data;
            dummy.next = node.next;
            Node&lt;T&gt;* head=new Node(*dummy);
            *this = *head;
            while(dummy.next != NULL) {
                dummy = *(dummy.next);
                head = head-&gt;next;
                head = new Node(*dummy);
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I have operator* so *dummy results in T type.</p>

<p>Another Note: My public and private fields may be wrong - but I will deal with it later. </p>

<p>After you puked a bit, let's look at the Copy C'tor please.</p>

<p>It gets a const refernce of Node, and then I tried to create a pointer to it. The compiler outputs an error:
<code>Node&lt;T&gt;* dummy= &amp;node;</code> results <code>invalid conversion from 'const Node&lt;int&gt;*' to 'Node&lt;int&gt;*'</code> (I have a short main trying to create <code>Node&lt;int&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>Ok, so it seems like I can't create a pointer to a const, so I tried to copy it's fields manualy as shown in code.
When I run Eclipse debugger and check if it works - it does. 
However, when I keep making steps the D'tor is called on <em>head</em> (in the end of the copy constructor) and as a result everything falls apart.
So I have no idea what to do next, or even if I am in the right way.</p>

<p>How should I make the copy constructor? I think I understand why the D'tor is called (I created something and in the end of the block, that something is destroyed - right?), but I don't know how to make it right.</p>

I would just hard code it, but the problem is that it's future customers who will potentially be adding rectangles to the row and I want their only job to be adding the rectangles and not having to worry about creating new rows, etc. Is there a straightforward way to do this with QML?

<p>I have tested the same TEncodedStream class with text to be saved coming from a Tmemo and it works fine, so i guest the fault is in the TStringList used to hold the temporary text (FLogParams is a TStringList previously created and released when the form is destroyed).</p>

<p>The problem is that is does not create an element for every ""chart"" entry.
Instead, it creates only one list item, but loops the ""chart"" entries inside it, rendering a huge sole item.</p>

<p>The store is this:</p>

<pre><code>Ext.regStore('ChartsStore', {
    model: 'Chart',
    proxy: {
        type: 'scripttag',
        reader: {
            type: 'json',
            root: 'root'
        }
    },
    getGroupString: function (record) {
        if (record &amp;&amp; record.data.text) {
            return record.get('text');
        } else {
            return 'No description';
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone knows how to fix this?
Thanks,
Arttie</p>

I only managed to add scroll through content by <strong>overflow</strong> property,but this time all columns are scrolling as well.My task is to <strong><em>freeze columns while maintaining column width</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Let this be my grid</p>

        &lt;/Columns&gt;
    &lt;/asp:GridView&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and this is code view</p>

<pre><code> public class Person

     public String Surname { get; set; }
 }

  File </p>
  
  <p>Action-Id: urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:action:delete123,
  Action-Value: Delete</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Response I get is <strong>Deny</strong>. As you see that <code>MustBePresent = true</code> in Subject, Resource and Action of Policy-Target and Request contains none's Id. According to the XACML 2.0 if MustBePresent is true and IDs are NOT present in the request then the target will be Indeterminate. And if the target is policy-target then the whole policy will be indeterminate. But in this case after indeterminate policy-target, PDP still evaluate the Rule and making result according to the Rule combining algorithm.</p>

<p>Let me know if I am wrong.</p>

I am using eclipselink JPA implementation (Entity) with GWT 2.0 framework on presentation layer.
Everything is working properly. But when i change my JPA implementation to Hibernate, I get Serialization/Deserialization Exception on GWT Layer when I pass entity beans but It is okay on eclipselink JPA.
Whats really happens? Hibernate is an implementation of JPA and eclipselink too, why those act differently?</p>

<p>What should I do for solving this exception on Hibernate? using Hibernate4gwt?</p>

<p>Which JPA implementation is better for GWT?</p>

<pre><code>function f(a, b) = c + 42
    where c = a * b
</code></pre>

<p>(Say it's a subset of Lisp that includes 'defun' and 'let'.)</p>

<p>Also imagine that it includes immutable objects that look like:</p>

<pre><code>struct s(a, b, c = a * b)
</code></pre>

<p>Again analogizing to Lisp (this time a superset), say a struct definition like that would generate functions for:</p>

<pre><code>make-s(a, b)
s-a(s)
s-b(s)
s-c(s)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, given the simple set up, it seems clear that there is a lot of similarity between what happens behind the scenes when you either call 'f' or 'make-s'. Once 'a' and 'b' are supplied at call/instantiate time, there is enough information to compute 'c'.</p>

<p>You could think of instantiating a struct as being like a calling a function, and then storing the resulting symbolic environment for later use when the generated accessor functions are called. Or you could think of a evaluting a function as being like creating a hidden struct and then using it as the symbolic environment with which to evaluate the final result expression.</p>

<p>Is my toy model so oversimplified that it's useless? Or is it actually a helpful way to think about how real languages work? Are there any real languages/implementations that someone without a CS background but with an interest in programming languages (i.e. me) should learn more about in order to explore this concept?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks for the answers so far. To elaborate a little, I guess what I'm wondering is if there are any real languages where it's the case that people learning the language are told e.g. ""you should think of objects as being essentially closures"". Or if there are any real language implementations where it's the case that instantiating an object and calling a function actually share some common (non-trivial, i.e. not just library calls) code or data structures.</p>

<p>Does the analogy I'm making, which I know others have made before, go any deeper than mere analogy in any real situations?</p>

<p>Specifically, I have a module that uses Ghostscript to perform various actions: extract page images, create a new pdf from a slice, etc.  I use the following to execute the command and return a through stream of the child's stdout:</p>

<pre><code>function spawnStream(command, args, storeStdout, cbSuccess) {
  storeStdout = storeStdout || false;

  const child = spawn(command, args);
  const stream = through(data =&gt; stream.emit('data', data));

  let stdout = '';
  child.stdout.on('data', data =&gt; {
    if (storeStdout === true) stdout += data;
    stream.write(data);
  });

  let stderr = '';
  child.stderr.on('data', data =&gt; stderr += data);

  child.on('close', code =&gt; {
    stream.emit('end');
    if (code &gt; 0) return stream.emit('error', stderr);
    if (!!cbSuccess) cbSuccess(stdout);
  });

  return stream;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is invoked by function such as:</p>

<pre><code>function extractPage(pathname, page) {
  const internalRes = 96;
  const downScaleFactor = 1;
  return spawnStream(PATH_TO_GS, [
    '-q',
    '-sstdout=%stderr',
    '-dBATCH',
    '-dNOPAUSE',
    '-sDEVICE=pngalpha',
    `-r${internalRes}`,
    `-dDownScaleFactor=${downScaleFactor}`,
    `-dFirstPage=${page}`,
    `-dLastPage=${page}`,
    '-sOutputFile=%stdout',
    pathname
  ]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>which is consumed, for example, like this:</p>

<pre><code>it('given a pdf pathname and page number, returns the image as a stream', () =&gt; {
  const document = path.resolve(__dirname, 'samples', 'document.pdf');
  const test = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
    const imageBlob = extract(document, 1);
    imageBlob.on('data', data =&gt; {
      // do nothing in this test
    });

    imageBlob.on('end', () =&gt; resolve(true));
    imageBlob.on('error', err =&gt; reject(err));
  });

  return Promise.all([expect(test).to.eventually.equal(true)]);
});
</code></pre>

<p>When this is interrupted, for example if the test times out or an unhandled error occurs, the child process doesn't seem to receive any signal and survives.  It's a bit confusing, as no individual operation is particularly complex and yet the process appears to survive indefinitely, using 100% of CPU.</p>

<p>I thought to use a timer to send a kill signal to the child but selecting an arbitrary interval to kill a process seems like it would effectively be trading an known problem for an unknown one and kicking that can down the road.</p>

<p>I would really appreciate any insight into what I'm missing here.  Is there a better option to encapsulate child processes so the termination of the parent is more likely to precipitate the child's interrupt?</p>

<p>It's a new table and our app controls all writing to the database, so we don't need evil hacks like triggers. Instead we will build the change tracking into our business object layer, but we need to figure out the right database schema to use.  </p>

<p>The number of rows will be under 100,000 and number of changes per record will average 1.5 per year.</p>

<p>There are at least two ways we've been looking at modelling this: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>As a <a href=""http://www.kimballgroup.com/2008/09/22/slowly-changing-dimensions-part-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension</a> table called <code>CustomersHistory</code>, with columns for <code>EffectiveStartDate</code>, <code>EffectiveEndDate</code> (set to <code>NULL</code> for the current version of the customer), and auditing columns like <code>ChangeReason</code> and <code>ChangedByUsername</code>.  Then we'd build a <code>Customers</code> view over that table which is filtered to <code>EffectiveEndDate=NULL</code>.  Most parts of our app would query using that view, and only parts that need to be history-aware would query the underlying table. For performance, we could materialize the view and/or add a filtered index on EffectiveEndDate=NULL. </p></li>
<li><p>With a separate audit table. Every change to a <code>Customer</code> record writes once to the <code>Customer</code> table and again to a <code>CustomerHistory</code> audit table. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>From a quick review of StackOverflow questions, #2 seems to be much more popular. But is this because most DB apps have to deal with legacy and rogue writers? </p>

<p>In my iPad application, I have used a UICollectionView which displays different notes saved by the user in core data through NSFetchedResultsController.
According to the design, I must have to show a cell with control to add new note in core data. Once the note is added it is displayed as the 2nd cell in the collection view.</p>

<p>I tried to implement it in following manner;</p>

<pre><code>#pragma mark - UICollectionViewDataSource

- (NSInteger)numberOfSectionsInCollectionView:(UICollectionView*)collectionView
{
    return self.fetchedResultsController.sections.count?:1;
}

- (NSInteger)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView numberOfItemsInSection:   (NSInteger)section
{
    id&lt;NSFetchedResultsSectionInfo&gt; sectionInfo = [[self.fetchedResultsController sections] objectAtIndex:section];

    return [sectionInfo numberOfObjects]?:1;
}

- (UICollectionViewCell *)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    if (indexPath.section == 0 &amp;&amp; indexPath.item == 0)
{
    AddNewNoteCell *cell = [collectionView dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier:@""AddNewNoteCell"" forIndexPath:indexPath];
    cell.delegate = self;
    return cell;
    }
    else
    {
        NoteCell *cell = [collectionView dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier:@""NoteCell"" forIndexPath:indexPath];
        //Code for customization
    return cell;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this approach is causing problems. It doesn't add the newly created note cell immediately. If it adds, the newly added cell is displayed as ""Add new cell"". If I pop the view controller and load the view controller again it displays the cells correctly.</p>

<p>Please guide me for an accurate solution.
Is this possible?</p>

<p>I have been trying to figure this out for about a day now, and no luck.  Hopefully someone here can help.</p>

<p>I have a DataTable object that is bound to my DataGridView.  One column of the table, Col_4 in the example below needs to hold a value that comes from a enum type.  In this case I have used colors.  I need Col_4 of the table to be a column of ComboBox elements that allows me to select the desired color.  The color selection will then be stored in the DataTable that is bound to the DataGridView.</p>

<pre><code>namespace WindowsFormsApplication1
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {

        enum MyColors {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, White};
        List&lt;MyColors&gt; colors = Enum.GetValues(typeof(MyColors)).Cast&lt;MyColors&gt;().ToList();

        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {

            DataTable table = new DataTable(""theData"");
            table.Columns.Add(""Col_1"");

            table.Columns.Add(""Col_3"");
            table.Columns.Add(""Col_4"");

            DataGridViewComboBoxColumn comboCol = new DataGridViewComboBoxColumn();
            comboCol.ValueType = typeof(MyColors);
            comboCol.DataSource = colors;
            comboCol.DataPropertyName = ""Col_4"";

            DataRow row = table.NewRow();
            row[""Col_1""] = 1;
            row[""Col_2""] = 2;
            row[""Col_3""] = 3;
            row[""Col_4""] = 4;

            table.Rows.Add(row);

            dataGridView1.DataSource = table;
            dataGridView1.Columns.Add(comboCol);
            dataGridView1.AllowUserToAddRows = false;

            Console.WriteLine(dataGridView1.Rows[0].State.ToString());
        }


    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am having two problems with this:</p>

<p>(1) How do I get the column of ComboBox elements to have the ""Col_4"" header?
(2) How do I make the selected ComboBox value get correctly stored in the DataTable?</p>

<p>This may be simple, but I am new to C# and I am getting really confused.  Any help that you can gibe will be really helpful.</p>

My problem is that I'm trying to navigate to another view when clicking on this buttons. I've already made one application using storyboard and I was able navigate through views with no problems, but in that case all the buttons were displayed in the storyboard canvas, so I was able to use the UI to create this interaction using the <strong>- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender</strong> method. This is not the case with the iCarousel. The buttons are created via code and are not displayed in the canvas UI. </p>

<p>I need to change that into binary format but the problem is the file has some headers (see <a href=""http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf</a>) that need to be written in ASCII even for binary files.</p>

<p>Now I don't have enough experience with binary formats and my first try was to open two streams via</p>

<pre><code>ofstream asciiWriter(file_name.c_str());
ofstream binWriter(file_name.c_str(), ios::app | ios::binary);
</code></pre>

<p>problem is the output seems to be disorganized and <code>asciiWriter</code> and <code>binWriter</code> are not outputting in the correct order and so I cannot post-process my file in ParaView. One thing I tried was to use <code>asciiWriter.flush()</code> and <code>binWriter.flush()</code> whenever I'm done with header/data writing but that does not help either.</p>

<p>What should I do?</p>

<p>PS: I do not want to use the VTK package itself ... its HUGE and adds to my code dependency!</p>

<p>I was hoping to get this result:</p>

<p>In other words, on iterating, it also returns <code>NodeTypeB</code> objects when they have children. This makes sense, since in <code>RecursiveNodeFilterIterator::accept()</code> I have defined <code>return $this-&gt;hasChildren() || ...</code>, in order for the filter to visit all possible child nodes.</p>

<p>Is there a way to have <code>RecursiveNodeFilterIterator</code> visit child nodes of <code>NodeTypeB</code> without actually returning the <code>NodeTypeB</code> nodes themselves?</p>

<p>The thing that bothers me is that <code>run()</code> nearly always sleeps on <code>accept()</code> and it's basically a background thread that can only die when the process dies without external intervention (i.e cannot close itself down upon request). This would most certainly be a messy death, but since the process dies too no one (except maybe the socket that's connected to us via <code>accept()</code>) would care. I'm guessing that <code>pthread_cancel()</code> would be just as messy without some kind of cleanup.</p>

<p>A method off the top of my head is that I open a socket myself somewhere in the process and send the quit request over the socket when I want the server thread to quit. This request is handled in the server code along with all other possible requests. But isn't this a bit awkward?</p>

<p>My question is, what is the correct way to <strong>close the socket server thread down</strong> cleanly without closing the process down (possibly relaunch it in the future)?</p>

<p>I need to pass a collection of unique identifiers to my stored procedure. I wrote this query to test what I want to do:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  *

</code></pre>

<p>This query runs correctly. So I created this stored procedure:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[MySproc] (
@TypeIdsList varchar(8000)
) AS

BEGIN
EXEC(
    'SELECT *
    FROM    MyTable
    WHERE   MyTable.TypeId IN (' + @TypeIdsList + ')'
)
END
</code></pre>

<p>But when I execute it with some sample data:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @return_value int

EXEC    @return_value = [dbo].[MySproc]
        @TypeIdsList = N'852D7F39-302A-4E35-94D4-9A0335F8E9DC,1DF6EAA0-D0EC-4E4D-9E6B-1779F0E42A82'

SELECT  'Return Value' = @return_value

GO
</code></pre>

<p>I get this error:</p>

<p>and so on...</p>

<p>I want to display a bird's eye view of the count of lenses in each combination in a 2d format this way:</p>

<pre><code>Spherical/Cylindrical|0|0.25|0.5|0.75|... upto 8 in steps of 0.25
-----------------------------------------     
                 0   |1|  1 | 2 | 1  |
               0.25  |0|  0 | 2 | 2  |
               0.5   |1|  2 | 0 | 2  |
               0.75  |2|  1 | 2 | 1  |
                ...
               upto 30 in steps of 0.25
</code></pre>

<p>How do I implement this in c#.net with sql server 2008? which would be the best approach?</p>

<p>I have a couple of thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate a view at run time using some special query and format it
in 2d </li>
<li>Create a 2d table kind of (in the above format) and update the
count each time the lens table is updated.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please give me your thoughts and advise on this. Thanks!</p>

<p>I don't think there's any problem with code, I just don't understand why lm function is giving NaN for a perfect adjustment when it should be giving back a Rsq=1. Each row represents an animal being tested and I'm fitting their movement. Since some animals stay perfectly freezed all the time, lm adjustments should give me y=0*x+0 (which does) Rsq=1.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The training samples are first sorted on the values of the attribute Y being considered. There are only a finite number of these values, so let us denote them in sorted order as {v1,v2, â¦,vm}. 
  Any threshold value lying between vi and vi+1 will have the same effect of dividing the cases into those whose value of the attribute Y lies in {v1, v2, â¦, vi} and those whose value is in {vi+1, vi+2, â¦, vm}. There are thus only m-1 possible splits on Y, all of which should be examined systematically to obtain an optimal split.</p>
  
  <p>It is usual to choose the midpoint of each interval: (vi +vi+1)/2 as the representative threshold. C4.5 chooses as the threshold a smaller value vi for every interval {vi, vi+1}, rather than the midpoint itself.</p>

if (m == null) {

} else {
    alert('found some occurrences, but what to do with it?');

<p>So I did my first attempt at the regex, which doesn't seem to be correct. Secondly, I don't really know how to use it to get the image description and uuid from them.</p>

Thanks to the answer from @Teneff I now made something like you see below. Unfortunately, this doesn't work as it always alerts null. Any idea what I'm doing wrong here?</p>

<pre><code>function imgTagToHtmlTag(text) {
    var re = /!\[([^\]]+)\]\[([^\]]+)\]/g;
    var m;

    while ((m = re.exec(text)) != null) {
        if (m.index === re.lastIndex) {
            re.lastIndex++;
        }
    }
    alert(m);
    // View your result using the m-variable.

But in this case I have to open and write the files headers first. Then keep writing/appending the query results one by one for multiple queries. This appending part I have written as a function. The problem that my script write the file with the headers (from the first part) only, it does not follow the fputcsv commands present in the function when it is called. Can you help me in solving this.</p>

<p>Here is my code to first open the file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$fp = fopen('php://output', 'w');
$headers = array(""Index"",""Gene_symbol"",""Gene_Name"",""Human_entrez"",""Rat_entrez"",""Mouse_entrez"",""DbTF"",""PMID"");
header('Content-Type: text/csv');
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""export.txt""');
fputcsv($fp, $headers,chr(9));
header('Pragma: no-cache');
header('Expires: 0');
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then the query part is somewhat like this (I have multiple of such query parts each one calling the same function) :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
if (is_numeric($sterm))
    {
        $query=""select * from tf where entrez_id_human=$sterm || entrez_id_rat=$sterm || entrez_id_mouse=$sterm"";
        $result=mysql_query($query) or die(mysql_error());
        if (mysql_num_rows($result)==0)
          {echo ""&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align='center' colspan=6&gt; $sterm not found!  &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;"";}
         elseif (mysql_num_rows($result)&gt;0)
         {result_disp($result);}
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>then writing the result to file via a function is here:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
function result_disp($results)
{
if($fp &amp;&amp; $results)
{
 while ($rows = mysql_fetch_row($results))
    {
        fputcsv($fp, array_values($rows),chr(9));
    } die;
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And finally closing the file at end of script</p>

<pre><code>fclose($fp);
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, I'm using CakePHP's MVC framework, and the online store I'm building is just using 2 models, Category and Product, described by the following CREATE statements:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `categories` (
    `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
    `name` varchar(255) default NULL,
    `parent_id` int(11) default NULL REFERENCES categories(`id`),
    `lft` int(11) default NULL,
    `rght` int(11) default NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);
CREATE TABLE `products` (
    `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
    `name` varchar(255) default NULL,
    `artist_id` int(11) default NULL REFERENCES artists(`id`),
    `description` text default NULL,
    `category_id` int(11) default NULL REFERENCES categories(`id`),
    `status` enum('in stock', 'pre-order', 'out of stock') NOT NULL,
    `price` decimal(6,2) default NULL,
    `picture` varchar(255) default NULL,
    `picture2` varchar(255) default NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);
</code></pre>

<p>The online store is going to encompass:</p>

<ul>
<li>Music
<ul>
<li>CDs</li>
<li>DVDs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Apparel
<ul>
<li>Hoodies</li>
<li>T-shirts
<ul>
<li>Long-sleeve Tees</li>
<li>Babydolls</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hats</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Misc Merch
<ul>
<li>Stickers</li>
<li>Posters</li>
<li>Tote Bags</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Downloads
<ul>
<li>Ringtones</li>
<li>MP3s</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, that's the structure of the category tree, though we may add new categories in the future. Right now all products are treated equally as Product class objects, with their category_id being the only way to distinguish different types of products. The online store is also just one section of the site. The rest of the site contains information such as artist bios and discographies; thus I also have models/tables for: <b>Artist</b>, <b>Album</b>, <b>Track</b>.</p>

<p>Is this a good approach? Or should I be creating separate subclasses for CDs/T-shirts/MP3s/... which inherit from the Product class? I'd like to link each music CD in the store to the discography entry to automatically generate track listings and other information for the product description.</p>

<p>If this is not a good way to go about things, how would you do it instead? Also, what methods/properties should I include in my Category/Product class? And should I only list products in leaf nodes of the category tree?</p>

<p>Edit:<br />
Obviously this design is incomplete. As Cyril pointed out, the Product.price field was missing, and there are still no provisions for sales. I'm actually still trying to work out how best to design &amp; implement those aspects of the store. Most likely, I will just have another model called <b>Orders</b>, but actually processing orders is made more complicated by the fact that we are applying different shipping rates based on shipping destination and what the order contains.</p>

<p><strong>1: Have a different stylesheet for every web page/module.</strong></p>

<p>Obviously we were very new to web apps then, and this approach resulted in too many style sheets and too much repetition of styles. We had a tough time to achieve consistency across the application.</p>

<p><strong>2: Have a common style sheets which is shared across the similar web pages.</strong></p>

<p>This worked well for sometime until it became too complex. Also we found that we had too many exceptions which still resulted in tweaking common styles for particular cases, which if done incorrectly can affect different parts of the application and at some point it becomes difficult. Also having a large development team (across different time zones) and tough project timeline didn't helped our cause.</p>

<p>Although #2 works, but still we have seen our products still doesn't have the similar UI quality and consistency as we would like to.</p>

   public override Nomenklature Nomenklature
   {
      get
