<p>This is what I've done so far (following the GitHub instructions from the link above as well as the <a href=""http://railscasts.com/episodes/302-in-place-editing"" rel=""nofollow"">RailsCast</a>:</p>

<p>In my <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code>gem 'rails', '3.0.11'
gem 'best_in_place', '~&gt; 0.2.0'
</code></pre>

<p>I also ran <code>rails g best_in_place:setup</code> since I'm on 3.0 and it generated a <code>best_in_place.js</code> file into <code>public/javascripts</code>.</p>

<p>And finally to display the records to be edited in-place:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""profileGains""&gt;""&lt;%= best_in_place @project, :my_quote %&gt;""&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using RESTful routes so I have the <code>update</code> action for my project resource.</p>

<p>At this point, the record is displayed but I can't click on it (or any of the other ones).</p>

<p>Any suggestions? I'm new to JS and really stuck.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I created an <code>application.js</code> file in which I added the following code:</p>

<pre><code>//= require jquery
//= require jquery.purr
//= require best_in_place

$(document).ready(function() {
  /* Activating Best In Place */
  jQuery("".best_in_place"").best_in_place();
});
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried the suggestion in the comments by Richlewis to add a script tag in my view:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/public/javascripts/best_in_place.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I tried changing <code>&lt;%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %&gt;</code> to
<code>&lt;%= javascript_include_tag :all %&gt;</code> in my <code>application.html.erb</code> layout file.</p>

<p>And again, best-in-place doesn't work.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> When inspecting the element using Chrome I found this error displayed in the logs:</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'best_in_place' 
application.js line 7
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea what this means?</p>

<p>I have a Bus model and a Cluster model. They look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>class Bus &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :left_centroids, class_name: ""Centroid""
  has_many :right_centroids, class_name: ""Centroid""
end

class Centroid &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :bus
end
</code></pre>

<p>Bus also has a method that is basically KMeans Algorithm, so I run it to replace the old <code>left_centroids</code> and then to replace the <code>right_centroids</code>. Right and Left differ in the value of a given field from the Centroid Model.</p>

<p>I have tried saving those via simple setting: <code>@bus.left_centroids = centroids_for_algorithms</code> and also through <code>update_attributes</code>. But whenever I save one, say left, right is overwritten with the values of left, and the other way around, which is pointless in the context of my application.</p>

<p>Am I missing something?</p>

<p>UPDATE: After I run the K Means Algorithm (from the ai4r gem, link in comments), I collect the centroids</p>

<pre><code>def algorithm(direction)
  clusters = k_means_algorithm_part

  centroids_to_add_to_bus = Centroid.limit 0
  clusters.centroids.each do |centroid|
    cent = Centroid.create(
      :latitude =&gt; centroid[0].to_d,
      :longitude =&gt; centroid[1].to_d,
      :catch_time =&gt; centroid[2],
      :direction =&gt; direction,
      :bus_id =&gt; bus_id
    )
    centroids_to_add_to_bus.append cent
  end
  bus = Bus.find(bus_id)
  if direction
    bus.right_centroids = centroids_to_add_to_bus
  else
    bus.left_centroids = centroids_to_add_to_bus

<p><strong>lock the Django DB</strong> while I make a <strong>complex transaction</strong> (read, decide, write) </p>

<p>... during which no other uwsgi worker should have access (or at least no <em>write</em> access) to that table?</p>

<p>I am using Django + db.sqlite3 + uwsgi (+ nginx).</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT 1:</p>

<p>Fantastic, of course Django itself solves the problem. Much easier than I had expected. Good that I asked around!</p>

<p>Here is my yellow-marker highlighted version <a href=""http://marker.to/W0CbtZ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marker.to/W0CbtZ</a>
of the manual page <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/db/transactions/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/db/transactions/</a> about transactions.</p>

<p>Thanks, IRC :-)</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT 2: </p>

<p>I am actually looking for a <strong>database LOCK</strong> for which all processes wait until it's their turn.</p>

<p>What I learnt today, I implemented now:</p>

<pre><code>try: 
   with transaction.atomic():
      foo(obj)
      obj.save()     # (*)
except IntegrityError:
   print ""debug information""
</code></pre>

<p>So I won't get an inconsistent DB ever. But now (*) is throwing an exception ""OperationalError: database is locked"" (and <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/databases/#database-is-locked-errors"" rel=""nofollow"">this suggestion</a> is not helping, too). Which I understand, because dozens of such transactions are trying to save-to-DB at the same time.</p>

<p>What I rather need is something like </p>

<pre><code>lock = threading.Lock()
...
with lock:
    foo(obj)
    obj.save()
</code></pre>

<p>But not <em>threading</em>, because it needs to lock across all uwsgi worker <em>processes</em>.</p>

<p>Any idea welcome. What is the most elegant way to do this? Which part of the manual to look into now? I googled already, and didn't find answers - that's why I ask here. </p>

<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT 3:</p>

<p>As I still had a small percentage of  ""OperationalError: database is locked"" failures (even with <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/28035529"">my threading.Lock</a>), I implemented @knbk's suggestion - but it didn't work, this is the output:</p>

<pre><code>up to here all is fine
ALERT! cannot start a transaction within a transaction
Out[]: False
</code></pre>

<p>This is how I implemented it, following @knbk's <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/28034823"">code example</a>:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import connection

def foobar():
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute('BEGIN IMMEDIATE')  # also tried 'BEGIN EXCLUSIVE'
    try:
        myObjects = myModel.objects.filter(myFilter=""myfilter"")
        if myCondition(myObjects) &gt; 0:
            obj = myObjects[0]
            print ""up to here all is fine""
            obj.save()                                          
    except Exception as e:
        connection.rollback()
        print ""ALERT!"", e
        return False
    finally:
        connection.commit()
    return True
</code></pre>

<p>So ... what now? </p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT 4:</p>

<p>I <strong>solved it myself</strong> now. I wrote a whole <strong>lockbydir.DLock</strong> class which uses directory existence and age - for locking across processes! Now I can simply lock access to the Django DB, and regardless which DB is used. Very happy. Perhaps you want to have a look? Here is the GIT:</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/drandreaskrueger/lockbydir"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/drandreaskrueger/lockbydir</a></p>

<p>See the README. There are even 3 GIT-Players to watch the code examples execute live in your browser! Great, isn't it? ;-)</p>

<p>Thanks for your time, and attention!</p>

I have a module with a toolbar control that gets loaded (properly) into the region that it is supposed to.  This toolbar is a listbox with ItemsSource databound to the ToolButtons property on its ViewModel, the constructor for which instantiates and adds three ToolButtons to the ToolButtons collection.</p>

<p>My ToolButton class has three custom DependencyProperties: Title (string), ButtonFace (Image), ActiveDocumentCount (int).  Styling is taken care of by a resource dictionary in the module with a Style and associated ControlTemplate.  I have databound the properties, but none of the values or the image are displaying (other elements in the style are however) via TemplateBinding.</p>

<p>I am trying to debug the databinding, but to no avail.

<p>I like how it makes the code more succinct.  However, I can see it potentially misleading at a first glance and imposing a readability issue, because it places the effect before the condition.  Then again, maybe that's just because I'm so used to C-style languages.</p>

<p>Okay, so my XML looks something like this:</p>

   &lt;ns:eventinfo&gt;
       &lt;ns:start year=""2011"" month=""9"" /&gt;

   &lt;ns:eventlocale&gt;My place&lt;/ns:eventlocale&gt;
&lt;/ns:event&gt;

<p>I am able to extract the information from the ""normal"" tags via:</p>

<pre><code>$data = simplexml_load_string($xml);
foreach ($data-&gt;children('ns', true) as $children) {
    $child = $children-&gt;children('ns',true);
    $eventname = ($child-&gt;eventname);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would give $eventname as Superevent. However, this approach doesn't work with attributes... </p>

<p>But if there wouldn't be any namespaces, I would easily extract the attributes with for example:</p>

<pre><code>$startyear = $data-&gt;$start['year'];
</code></pre>

<p>So - anyone got an idea to approach this problem with ease? Any info or ideas would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>I think I'd rather consider filenames as bytes and not strings, since that avoids the danger of using an incorrect encoding. Indeed, some of my file names use an incorrect encoding (latin1 when my system locale uses utf-8), but that doesn't prevent tools like ls from working. I'd like my tool to be resilient to that as well.</p>

<p>I have two problems: the command-line arguments are given to me as strings (I use argparse), and I want to report errors to the user as strings.</p>

<p>I've successfuly adapted my code to use binaries, and my tool can handle files whose name are invalid in the current default encoding, as long as it is by recursing trough the filesystem, because I convert the arguments to binaries early, and use binaries when calling fs functions. When I receive a filename argument which is invalid, however, it is handed to me as a unicode string with strange characters like <code>\udce8</code>. I do not know what these are, and trying to encode it always fail, be it with utf8 or with the corresponding (wrong) encoding (latin1 here).</p>

<p>The other problem is for reporting errors. I expect users of my tool to parse my stdout (hence wanting to preserve filenames), but when reporting errors on stderr I'd rather encode it in utf-8, replacing invalid sequences with appropriate ""invalid/question mark"" characters.</p>

<p>So,</p>

<p>1) Is there a better, completely different way to do it ? (yes, fixing the filenames is planned, but i'd still like my tool to be robust)</p>

<p>2) How do I get the command line arguments in their original binary form (not pre-decoded for me), knowing that for invalid sequences re-encoding the decoded argument will fail, and</p>

<p>3) How do I tell the utf-8 codec to replace invalid, undecodable sequences with some invalid mark rather than dying on me ?</p>

These records have properties like <i>w,v,x,y,z</i>. You want to design an application that is centered around a view of these records sorted by some function, <i><b>F</b></i>, that takes in <i>x,y</i>, and some values, <i>a,b</i> that are not part of the records, and are <i>NOT known at insertion time</i>. The ordering doesn’t have to be 100% strict, but for every pair of records in the view <b>R</b><sub>i</sub> and <b>R</b><sub>i-1</sub> in the view <i><b>F</b></i>(x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>,a,b) > <i><b>F</b></i>(x<sub>i-1</sub>,y<sub>i-1</sub>,a,b) with high probability.</p>

<p>For example, if you wanted to add a “Nearby” view to Instagram (which has a bunch of photos), which would display a list of photos sorted by some function of proximity to user and freshness of the photo (e.g. how recently it was posted).
So in this example <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are photo location and creation timestamp; <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the user’s location and current timestamp.</p>

<p>How would you design such a system? What questions would you ask? Are there some combination of data stores out there that are good for this sort of thing?</p>

<p>How does the design change if you want the view to update in close to real time as new records are added?
Any papers or articles out there that have investigated similar problems?</p>

<p>NOTE: I don’t actually work at Instagram or do anything related to this problem really. Just trying to satisfy a curiosity.</p>

<p>My question is, rather than a single field, can I split the user's input box into the three separate elements (Day / Month / Year), whilst still using the datepicker to check whether the date exists (to prevent the user from choosing February 31st for example)?</p>

<p>Basic datepicker code 'cause I've been told to include code D:</p>

We then might resort to Binding to a parent <code>Tag</code> and then use Element Binding. So the source might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Grid.Tag&gt;
    &lt;Binding Path=""MyProperty"" Source=""{StaticResource MySource}"" /&gt;
&lt;/Grid.Tag&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What happens when we can't even do this? My next sloppy trick is to use a collapsed <code>UserControl</code> element:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl
    x:Name=""MySloppyControl""
    DataContext=""{StaticResource YetAnotherSourceInThisCrazyGrid}""
    Foreground={Binding CrazyForegroundColor}
    Visibility=""Collapsed"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Grid.Resources&gt;
    &lt;Style TargetType=""{x:Type TextBox}""&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""Foreground"" Value=""{Binding CrazyForegroundColor, ElementName=MySloppyControl}"" /&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;
&lt;/Grid.Resources&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming that I explained this adequately, is this collapsed <code>UserControl</code> pattern misguided?</p>

However as far as I can tell, this is impossible. <code>pthread_mutex_unlock</code> is specified to either have undefined behavior (in the case of normal or default type mutexes) or to fail (in the case of recursive or error-checking mutexes) if the calling thread is not the owner of the mutex. And in the child handler registered with <code>pthread_atfork</code>, the calling thread is the main thread of the newly created process, and thus <em>cannot be</em> the owner of the mutex.</p>

<p>Am I mistaken or is the whole <code>pthread_atfork</code> idiom broken by design and essentially impossible to use?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I also fail to see any valid (portable) workaround for the issue. Ideally one could just destroy and re-initialize the mutexes in the child process, except that calling <code>pthread_mutex_destroy</code> on an initialized mutex is specified as undefined behavior in order to accommodate ridiculous implementations where mutexes are not POD but involve a reference to some kernel-level object.</p>

<p>Starting JBoss from the command line works without a problem, eclipse can even connect to it that way. If Eclipse is connected to JBoss it can shut it down, so the problem is purely the starting of the server.</p>

<pre><code>  - (void)scrollViewDidEndDecelerating:(UIScrollView *)scrollView
    {
//here I verify when the last frame of the scrollView is loaded
     if (self.scrollView1.contentOffset.x == self.view.frame.size.width*pathImages.count)

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://tenant1.mywicketapplication.com/somepage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tenant1.mywicketapplication.com/somepage/</a>...</li>
<li><a href=""http://tenant2.mywicketapplication.com/somepage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tenant2.mywicketapplication.com/somepage/</a>...</li>

<p>This might not be handled in wicket (but needs some mapping on the web server level). Hence the name spaces may look like that:</p>

<ul>
<li>...//mywicketapplication.com/tenant1/somepage/...</li>
<li>...//mywicketapplication.com/tenant2/somepage/...</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I need to prevent that a user that was authenticated for tenant1 may access tenant2. I could store the tenant specific url part (here ""tenant1"") in the session and check for each page whether it maches the stored url part. The drawback is that this architecture is not very secure since this check may be forgotten for each new page (yes - that would be a bug...). A stronger solution would have a single point to check it. It would be great to check that in the security layer, e.g. within ""Wicket Auth/Roles"".</p>

<p>So my question: Where can I check whether a request requires a new session or is mapped to an existing session? Are there already concepts or hooks in Wicket for multiple tenants? What is your experience?</p>

<p>So once Google Transliterate does its work and updates the DOM, I am trying to refresh scope with $scope.$apply() after a time out. All the words get updated into new language in the textarea, but the last typed word doesn't update in the scope till the model encounters a new Character.</p>

Suppose I have a set of private and public keys, stored in files dummy_private.txt and dummy_public.txt.</p>

<p>I create a private key object and public key object like this:</p>

<pre><code>private_key_file='dummy_private.txt'
f = open(private_key_file, 'r')
privateKey = RSA.importKey(f.read(),None)
f.close()

public_key_file='dummy_public.txt'
f = open(public_key_file, 'r')
publicKey = RSA.importKey(f.read(),None)
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Now suppose I want to encrypt some message. I can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>s='This is a super secret message'
sutf8=s.encode('utf8')

enc=publicKey.encrypt(sutf8,None)[0]
encb64=base64.encodestring(enc)
print ""Public key Encoded message is %s"" % (encb64,)
</code></pre>

<p>This makes sense because I am encrypting with the public key and I should be able to decrypt with the private key.</p>

<p>However, I can also encrypt the above using the private key, and it gives me the same result!</p>

<pre><code>enc2=privateKey.encrypt(sutf8,None)[0]
encb642=base64.encodestring(enc2)
print ""Private key Encoded message is %s"" % (encb642,)
</code></pre>

<p>When I print out the base64 encoded version of the encrypted data, using either the private key or the public key, they are the same! Why is that?</p>

<p>And this raises the problem of digitally signing something with the private key. If I can sign something with the public key and get the same results, then how does signing verify that I am who I say I am? This must be some issue with the encrypt method that I don't understand. Can someone please explain?</p>

<p>Since encrypting with both the public key and private key gives the same results, it appears that decrypting with the private key can be done regardless of whether the encryption was done with the private key or the public key. I'm totally confused as to why one could encrypt with the private key and get a result that is the same as if it were done with the public key.</p>

<p>The way it goes - I have a set number of entries in HTML (10 for the time being). They are sorted by time added. When a user selects some sort of sorting, there is a possibility that there are other entries in the database that match the requested parameters, yet they are not loaded. So I use jQuery to insert the elements that match the users sort request</p>

<pre><code>$.get('myfile.php?request=something', function(callback) {
    var $newItems = $(callback);
    $('.container').isotope( 'insert', $newItems );
    $('.container').isotope({ sortBy : USER_SORT });
});
</code></pre>

<p>All of it works perfectly, the only issue I have, is that I get more elements added (I wish to keep a set number of visible entries). I could do a workaround and limit the height of my container and set <code>overflow: hidden;</code>, but I'm also implementing vertical infinite scroll (when you scroll to the bottom more entries are added). So that would require constant managing of the container itself, and it seems to me like there should be a better way of doing this?</p>

<p>Another way would be adding the new elements, doing the sort, and then removing the unwanted entries from the bottom, but that would be awful, as the user will see additional data filtered and animated, and then removed.</p>

<p>So my question .. Is there a way to limit the entries within Isotope itself? Or maybe someone has a better idea of how to limit them?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

Quite irritating, because I'm working on a class that contains a list of XML files, and now I just want to use a for-in loop to walk through all files in this list. This is the class I have right now:<br /></p>

<pre><code>type
  TXmlFileList = class( TInterfacedObject )
  private
    type
      TItem = class( TInterfacedObject )
      strict private
        FCaption: string;
      protected
        constructor Create( const ACaption: string; const AXML: WideString );
      public
        destructor Destroy; override;
        property Caption: string read FCaption;
      end;
  strict private
    FXmlFiles: array of TXmlFileList.TItem;
  strict protected
    function GetXmlFile( index: Integer ): TXmlFileList.TItem;
  public
    constructor Create( );
    destructor Destroy; override;
    function Add( const ACaption: string; const AXML: WideString ): Integer; overload;
    function Add( const AFilename: string ): Integer; overload;
    function Count: Integer;
    procedure Clear;
    property XmlFile[ index: Integer ]: TXmlFileList.TItem read GetXmlFile; default;
  end;
</code></pre>

<p>Looks funny? :-) I know, but I want to hide the definition of the TXmlFile class to the outside world. Basically, the TXmlFileList class allows me to simply refer to XmlFileList[I] to get the file at position I. Works nicely. </p>

<p>But now I want to loop through the TXmlFileList.TItem elements, so I have to expose the TXmlFileList.TItem class. It's not enough, though. It needs an enumerator too in the TXmlFileList class!<br />How to create that enumerator?<br /><br /><br /><br />You're probably wondering why I use this complex construction. Well, it might be complex but it will be used by some other developers and I don't want to provide more methods than they need. This way, I only give them the methods ""Add"", ""Clear"" and ""Count"" to loop through the list, and any property defined on the TItem itself. They don't need more than this, although I might add a few more features later on...</p>

<p>And the error that I get:</p>

<pre><code>./test.h:1:7: warning: 'A' has no out-of-line virtual method definitions; its vtable will be emitted in every translation unit [-Wweak-vtables]
</code></pre>

<p>The above code builds fine when class A is not pure abstract. The following code doesn't emit warnings, and the only change is that class A is no longer abstract:</p>

<p>test2.h:</p>

<pre><code>class A
{
  public:
    A();
    virtual ~A();
};
</code></pre>

<p>test2.cc</p>

<pre><code>#include ""test2.h""

A::A() {;}
A::~A() {;}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My question</strong> </p>

<p>What's so special about <em>pure abstract classes</em> that the above code triggers warnings in Clang?</p>

<p>I am extracting a region from Image and I want to store it in array. Therefore, I wanted to create an array of type Mat, where array elements can store the matrix (part of image).</p>

<p>Similarly, I was trying to include a variable k for variable window size and created a 3-D array of type MAT but it didn't work. I dont know whats the problem or how can I use your method?</p>

<p>The advantage of this pattern should be speed (the methods are in the elements prototype chain, so they are referenced once). You guessed right: IE no go. In IE &lt; 8 the prototype of html elements is hidden/not accessible, so for every element you create, you have to reference the non standard methods again (leaving you with a lot of pointers if you use the pattern intensively). I have searched the web for solutions, but only found complex workarounds. Is there <em>really</em> no way to access a HTML elements prototype in IE?</p>

            }
          }
        ]
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>but I can't make writer to parse lines. When I'm truing to save my document I already have output like this:</p>

<pre><code>{ lines: 
   [ { line_lineItem_lineNumber: 1,

       line_lineItem_orderedQuantity: '45'} ],
</code></pre>

<p>(other parts of document are expanded well)</p>

<p>My problem is not with mouse events but I do not know how to show and hide an image in a header cell.
If it's not possible I would like to toggle the border color or something else so the user can know that something happened.</p>

<p>I've tried already code like this : <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1196400/how-to-display-an-image-in-a-datagridview-column-header"">How to display an image in a datagridview column header?</a>.</p>

<p>my code:</p>

<pre><code>if (e.ColumnIndex == 1 &amp;&amp; e.RowIndex == -1)
            {
                e.PaintBackground(e.ClipBounds, false);


                Point pt = e.CellBounds.Location;  // where you want the bitmap in the cell

                int offset = (e.CellBounds.Width - this.imageList1.ImageSize.Width) / 2;
                pt.X += offset;
                pt.Y += 1;
                this.imageList1.Draw(e.Graphics, pt, 0);


                e.Handled = true;




            }
</code></pre>

<p>A minor problem is that this code remove the CellHeaders text, this I could fix with storing the column names in a string array and to display it by the e.ColumnIndex:</p>

<pre><code>Font drawFont = new Font(""Microsoft Sans Serif"", 10);
SolidBrush drawBrush = new SolidBrush(Color.Black);

e.Graphics.DrawString(storredColNames[e.ColumnIndex], drawFont, drawBrush, e.CellBounds);
</code></pre>

<p>Is there another way to preserve the Col Names?</p>

<p>I tried stuff like this but it seems that I can acces the image just when it paints the cells, but I need to be able to acces the image when I right click, for showing and hiding it. Is there a way to do this ?</p>

"21478066","1","","","2014-01-31 10:44:15","","0","1012","<p>Suppose I have a set of 'model' entities, and a set of difficulty levels. Each model has a certain percentage success rate for a given day on a given difficulty level.</p>

<p>A model entity has a name, which is both unique and immutable under any circumstances, so it makes a natural primary key. A difficulty level is described by its name only (easy, normal, etc). Difficulty levels are very, very unlikely to change, though it's possible a new one could be added. A success rate record is uniquely identified by the model it pertains to, the difficulty level, and the date.</p>

<p>Here's the most trivial db design for this scenario:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/BvVDq.png"" alt=""db design with natural keys""></p>

<p>In this design, 'name' is the primary key for the table 'models' and is represented by a VARCHAR(20) field. Likewise, a VARCHAR(20) field 'name' is the primary key for the table 'difficulty_levels' (a lookup table). In the 'success_rates' table, 'model_name' is a foreign key referencing the 'name' field in the 'model' table, and 'difficulty_level' is a foreign key referencing the 'name' field in the 'difficulty_levels' table. The fields 'model_name', 'difficulty_level' and 'date' make up a composite primary key for the 'success_rates' table.</p>

<p>The most used queries would be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>getting all success rates for a certain model, difficulty level, and date period</p></li>
<li><p>getting the most/least successful models for a certain period and difficulty level.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, my question is - do I need to add surrogate primary keys to the 'models' and 'difficulty_levels' tables? I guess storing int values as opposed to varchar values in the foreign key fields of 'success_rates' takes up less space, and maybe the queries will be faster (just my wild guess, not sure about that)?</p>

<p>The problem I see with surrogate keys is that they have zero relevance to the business logic itself. I'm planning on using a mini-ORM (most likely Dapper), and without the surrogate keys I can operate on classes that very cleanly represent the entities I'm working with. Now, if I add surrogate keys, I'll have to add 'Id' properties to my classes, and I'm really against adding a database storage implementation like that to a class that can be used anywhere in the app, not even in connection with a database storage. I could add proxy storage classes with an Id property, but that adds another level of complexity. Plus the fact that the 'Id' property won't be readonly (so the ORM can set the ids after saving the entity to the database) means that it would be possible to accidentally set it to a random/invalid value.</p>

<p>I'm not very familiar with ORM's and I have zero knowledge of Dapper, so correct me if I was wrong in any of these points.</p>

<p>What would be the best approach here?</p>

<p>The issue I found with the MSDN article above was that it was using a holding the page instance open until the delegate was called. Instead of had it call another class that was static (vb shared). This caused a different problem -- the delegate lost context.

<p>Is there a way I can repopulate an item in cache every 30 minutes in ASP.NET without keeping page instances around? Note, I cannot use a sliding expiration date because the content will change. </p>

<p>This leaves no space between the items above and below the divider, but there's still the space at the top now. Also, the <code>android:checkableBehavior=""single""</code> behaves strangely. Items are not selected when selected the first time and items are not unselected once others do become selected.</p>

The javascript is actually hard coded in the SDK in the <code>alfresco-share-src.zip</code> in the class <code>org/alfresco/web/scripts/MessagesWebScript.java</code>. </p>

<p>We're currently building Alfresco using a Maven project and it pulls most of Alfresco and Share from maven plugins and repositories, giving us a clean root build additions in. However since this class is hard coded and we don't want to touch the original jars/zips, I thought I could just add a new copy of the file to <code>share/src/main/java/org/alfresco/web/scripts/MessagesWebScript.java</code>, compiling it into the war file's WEB-INF and thereby overriding what would get loaded from the jar (yes, I know a bad way of doing it).</p>

<p>However, if I just add the file, I get the error <code>/share/src/main/java/org/alfresco/web/scripts/MessagesWebScript.java:[48,80] error: cannot find symbol</code> on the line </p>

<pre><code>public class MessagesWebScript extends org.springframework.extensions.webscripts.MessagesWebScript
</code></pre>

<p>Which leads me to believe it's not pulling in the same dependencies used to build the war file (namely the spring-surf-parent dependency). If I try to add that dependency to the share.pom file (shown below), maven successfully builds, but the dependency somehow pulls in the servlet API jar files, adds them to the war and then I get the expected <code>The method getJspApplicationContext(ServletContext) is undefined for the type JspFactory</code> errors.</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.extensions.surf&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-surf-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;

<p>I have a form that raises the event:</p>

<pre><code>Public Class frmDgvLb

    Public Delegate Sub ProfileChanged()
    Public Event UpdateProfile As ProfileChanged

    Private Sub lbDgvEdit_SelectedIndexChanged(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles lbDgvEdit.SelectedIndexChanged
        If UpdateHotlist(cmdStr) = True Then
            If DgvName = ""dgvHotlist"" Then
                Hotlist.LoadDGV()
            ElseIf DgvName = ""dgvJobProfile"" Then
                RaiseEvent UpdateProfile()
            End If
            Me.Close()
        End If
    End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>I have another form where the event is defined and handled:</p>

<pre><code>Public Class frmGraph

    Public Sub New()
        InitializeComponent()
        AddHandler frmDgvLb.UpdateProfile, AddressOf RefreshProfiles
    End Sub

    Public Sub RefreshProfiles()
        GetProfiles(lbMach.SelectedItem, dtpJobDate.Value)
        CreateGraph(dtpJobDate.Value, _machList)
        zgc.Refresh()
    End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>My problem was that the RaiseEvent UpdateProfile() would only execute once. All subsequent index changes of the listbox would not raise the event? When stepping through with the debugger, when the conditional evaluated to true, the debugger would step to the  RaiseEvent line and then step to the line closing the conditional statement and the RefreshProfile Sub never executes. Again, the first time the index of the listbox changes, everything functions fine. Why is this?</p>

On a background thread I asynchronously retrieve data tables from several different servers.  These tables I then need to display in the grid.  I have a progress bar from the background thread displaying while I'm establishing connections and pulling the data, but when the grid is being filled the UI thread is (understandably) blocked.  Therefore, the progress bar stalls and it looks like the window is frozen.  Filling the grid can take anywhere from 20 seconds to 2 minutes depending on the data set (Yes, it's huge; No, I can't make it smaller sadly.)</p>

<p>What I want to know is without using any Linq or custom libraries how can I bind the data without blocking the UI (keep the progress bar moving), then display the whole thing in one go?</p>

<p>I don't necessarily require concrete code, but more ""This is what to do"" with some logic behind it. </p>

<p>The key, really, is to load the data into the grid while not blocking the UI thread so a progress indicator can be displayed (and active) while it is ongoing.</p>

<p>I've recently switched over to use the Security Enabled Connection String- </p>

<p>-so I could make use of the auditing features in Azure too. I set my Security Enabled Access settings to <em>Required</em> to enforce that, as I don't want to miss out on the auditing.</p>

<p>However I've had no new backups in Azure Storage since I switched over. I've investigated into the issue but can't come to a solid conclusion of what's going wrong.</p>

<p>I'm still able to connect to the server and view the database in SQL Management Studio using the non-secure connection string-</p>

<pre><code>{server}.database.windows.net

<p>-but I can't see any tables in the database, which is good as that indicates that the secure connection is indeed required.</p>

<p>My gut feel is that the automated backup in Azure uses the non-secure connection string by default and hasn't picked up the <em>Required</em> Security Enabled Access setting.</p>

<p>The automated backup feature is still in preview mode so the setting may not be supported yet.</p>

My problem is quite simple : I would like to highlight in red the forms fields that triggered validation errors. The error messages are placed correctly in the FacesContext using a context.addMessage(...) line.</p>

<p>I'd like my system to be generic. All form fields having a message attached are automatically highlighted.</p>

<p>I've found on this site a link to this excellent article :
<a href=""http://www.jroller.com/mert/entry/how_to_find_a_uicomponent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jroller.com/mert/entry/how_to_find_a_uicomponent</a></p>

<p>With it, I did implement a PhaseListener for the RENDER_RESPONSE phase, which do the following :</p>

<pre><code>@Override
  public void beforePhase(PhaseEvent event) {
    // get context
    FacesContext context = event.getFacesContext();

    // iterate on all the clientIds which have messages
    Iterator&lt;String&gt; clientIdsWithMessages = context.getClientIdsWithMessages();
    while (clientIdsWithMessages.hasNext()) {

      // get the clientId for the field component
      String clientIdWithMessage = clientIdsWithMessages.next();
      // split on "":""
      String[] splitted = clientIdWithMessage.split("":"");

      UIComponent component = findComponentInRoot(splitted[splitted.length - 1]);
      if (component != null) {
        Map&lt;String, Object&gt; attributes = component.getAttributes();

        if (attributes.containsKey(""style"")) {
          attributes.remove(""style"");
        }
        attributes.put(""style"", ""background-color: #FFE1E1;"");
      }
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This perform perfectly well for almost all my usage.</p>

<p>Now, where it becomes a bit tricky, is that some of my forms have such code :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ice:dataTable id=""revisionDocuments"" value=""#{agendaBean.agenda.revisionsDocuments}"" var=""revision""&gt;
    &lt;ice:column&gt;
        &lt;ice:inputText value=""#{revision.sequenceAdresse}"" id=""revisionSequenceAdresse"" /&gt;
    &lt;/ice:column&gt;
    ....
</code></pre>

<p>The generated form has several lines (one for each object of the revisionsDocuments list), and each element has a unique identifier (clientId) which looks like :</p>

<pre><code>contentForm:revisionDocuments:0:revisionSequenceAdresse
</code></pre>

<p>With 0 changed for 1, 2, ... for each iteration.
Consequently, the code provided to search the UIComponent from ViewRoot does not work properly. All forms fields have the same ""id"". What surprise me more is : they have the same ""clientId"" in FacesContext too :</p>

<pre><code>contentForm:revisionDocuments:revisionSequenceAdresse
</code></pre>

<p>I cannot distinguish, while going through the tree, if I do see the right form field or any of the others.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a hint to solve this ? Or another suggestion to implement the highlight of my fields ? I have to admit, I dont really like my code, I consider dirty to manipulate the viewRoot like I'm doing, but I could not figure out a better solution to have a generic highlight of my fields.</p>

I use F# when possible. Usually, I'm stuck with either VB.NET or C# (or VBA, when I'm really unlucky). So my languages allow me to stray quite far from the functional approach.</p>

<p>Historically I've ignored logging and communicating with the user until I've got a result--just let the user wait. Now I'm trying to implement logging and/or updates of status bars. It's easy, because my languages allow me to write to standard output whenever I want. But from a purely functional stand-point, how does one go about leaking information about what's going on inside one's function to the outside world? Is logging or communicating with the user during computation simply contrary to the purely functional approach?</p>

<p>I'm sure in Haskell one would use a Monad. What about when using other languages?</p>

<pre><code>#define get_pte_flags(x) (((int)((x) &gt;&gt; 40) &amp; ~0xFFF) | ((int)(x) &amp; 0xFFF))

<p>I understand <code>((int)(x) &amp; 0xFFF)</code> will extract the last 24 bits of x, but why they need the first part <code>((int)((x) &gt;&gt; 40) &amp; ~0xFFF)</code> ? </p>

<p>I'm lost at the purpose of <code>((intpte_t)((x) &amp; ~0xFFF) &lt;&lt; 40)</code>. It should be 0 in my opinion. Then why do we need it? </p>

<pre><code>cmd /C start iexplore http://www.google.com
</code></pre>

<p>This works well. But if you have to use parameters, it will not work:</p>

<pre><code>cmd /C start iexplore https://www.google.hu/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=r9frVbawJZChOomkqIgH&amp;gws_rd=ssl#q=find
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the passed text will be cut off at the first ""&amp;"" character. If I put the url into quotation mark it works again.</p>

<p>So I use this code to implement the addon:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>getIEPath: function () {
        var gMyPrefs = new PrefsWrapper1(""extensions.openinbrowser."");
        var iePath = gMyPrefs.getUnicharPref(""IEPath"");
        return iePath;
    },
    openInBrowser: function (url) {
        var iePath = openinbrowser.getIEPath();

        // create an nsILocalFile for the executable
        var file = Components.classes[""@mozilla.org/file/local;1""].createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsILocalFile);
        file.initWithPath(iePath);

        // create an nsIProcess
        var process = Components.classes[""@mozilla.org/process/util;1""].createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsIProcess);
        process.init(file);

        // Run the process
        var args = ['/C start iexplore ' + url + ' '];
        process.run(false, args, args.length);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This works for the first case: if there is no ""&amp;"" character in string it works. But if I exchange the key line to</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var args = ['/C start iexplore ""' + url + '"" '];
</code></pre>

<p>it will not work, as the <code>""</code> will be exchanged to URI code, but URI code will not work in IE.</p>

<p>Do you know what is the solution (I know that without <code>cmd</code> it works etc. but I need this <code>cmd</code> start solution)</p>

While I was trying to implement the library on my own I ran into some problems. One I don't quite understand the terminology of ""protocols"" and ""classes"" (I understand a little about classes). The first problem was the I couldn't use PFObjects in the CollectionView because an instance of JSQMessage needs to be passed through most of the custom methods. Now, I know how to take in a PFObject an get the properties from that like </p>

<pre><code>self.eachMessage = [self.messages objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]; //each message
self.eachMessage[@""message""] //message from the PFObject
self.eachMessage[@""sender""] //sender from the PFObject
</code></pre>

<p>The JSQMessage class has custom properties that would represent the properties of the PFObject like</p>

<pre><code>JSQMessage *message = [[JSQMessage alloc] init]; //initialize it
message.senderId //could be the objectId of the user
message.senderDisplayName //the user's username
message.text //text of the message
message.date //time sent of the message
</code></pre>

<p>The thing is, in the custom class JSQMessage...all of these properties are readonly. I am sure I can go in and change that so I can assign them to exactly what I want but there must be something I am missing here. I will attach everything in my .h and .m files. <strong>When I do send a message</strong> the only thing that comes through is the text and I believe that is because it picks up when comes from the textView on the inputToolbar.</p>

<p>There is no OOP (except for some small areas), code reuse it is at a minimum level.</p>

<p>One problem is also that dataaware controls are used, so it was very simple to drop many datasets+datasources on the datamodules and link directly to the DB in an highly coupled manner. </p>

<p>Ideally i would like to extract classes, like TCustomer, TEmployee, to get advantage os encapsulation and to make it possible to create new UI in the future without duplicating all code.</p>

<p>Anyway my question is: how do I can keep dealing with dataaware controls? Should I implement a function that returns a dataset, and I link the dataawarecomponent.datasource to the function result?</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I am aware of some slowness of UDF when using it inside <code>SELECT</code>, because it will run for each row, but I don't use it inside <code>SELECT</code>; it will run only once in combination with <code>SET</code> in a stored procedure for statistics purposes (along other functions without performance problems).</p>

However, they treat this second div as if it were about <em>60 pixels lower than it appears to be</em>. Some code is shown below. Basically, these draggables are contained to the expand div, <em>but they won't move closer than 60 pixels to the top</em>. When they get brought to the bottom, <em>they will stick 60 pixels out the bottom</em>. I can't figure out why this is happening, any thoughts? They obey heights just fine in the dock div, all other behavior is good.</p>

"21164360","1","21165233","","2014-01-16 14:22:08","","2","68","<p>I am developing a logger class that overloads the stream insertion operator.
I am having trouble catching the <code>std::flush</code> manipulator.</p>

<p>First, a quick summary of what I do:</p>

<p>Given an object of <code>LogClass</code>, I want to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>LogClass logger;
logger &lt;&lt; ""Some text"" &lt;&lt; std::flush;
</code></pre>

<p>... and catch the <code>std::flush</code> manipulator.</p>

<p>All input is sent directly to an internal string stream for later logging by the following inlined operator (which works fine):</p>

<pre><code>class LogClass
{
    // ...

    std::ostringstream m_internalStream;

    template &lt;typename T&gt;
    LogClass &amp; operator&lt;&lt;(const T &amp; rhs)
    {
        m_internalStream &lt;&lt; rhs;
        return *this;
    }

    // ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to catch the <code>std::flush</code> manipulator by overloading as follows (which also works fine):</p>

<pre><code>LogClass &amp; LogClass::operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp; (*manip)(std::ostream &amp;))
{
    std::ostream &amp; (* const flushFunc)(std::ostream &amp;) = std::flush;

    // Is the supplied manipulator the same as std::flush?
    if ((manip == flushFunc)) {
        flush(); // &lt;-- member function of LogClass
    } else {
        manip(m_stream);
    }

    return *this;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem shows if I try to make the local variable <code>flushFunc</code> static, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>static std::ostream &amp; (* const flushFunc)(std::ostream &amp;) = std::flush;
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the value of the incoming <code>manip</code> pointer is <em>not</em> equal to <code>flushFunc</code>.</p>

<p>Why is that? Does it have anything to do with template instantiations of the <code>std::flush</code> function for <code>char</code>?</p>

<p>I am using MS Visual Studio 2010 Pro.</p>

<p>The problem also shows in this small working code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;

int main(int, char **)
{
    static std::ostream &amp; (* const staticFlushPtr)(std::ostream &amp;) = std::flush;
    std::ostream &amp; (* const stackFlushPtr)(std::ostream &amp;) = std::flush;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::hex &lt;&lt;
            ""staticFlushPtr: "" &lt;&lt; (void *) staticFlushPtr &lt;&lt; ""\n""
            ""stackFlushPtr: "" &lt;&lt; (void *) stackFlushPtr &lt;&lt; ""\n"";

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>... which gives this output on my machine:</p>

<pre><code>staticFlushPtr: 013F1078
stackFlushPtr: 0FF10B30
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Best regards,
Rein A. Apeland</p>

I have installed SetupTools for 2.7 and it still comes up, despite being told this would fix it. This is the error that I need to fix the most, so if you only have an appropriate solution for this, that is fine. Thank you!</p>

<p>This is where i malloc for the key itself (problem is probably here):</p>

<pre><code>puts(""Please enter a value for key of new node"");
_flushall();
scanf(""%s"",&amp;buffer);
user_input = (char *) malloc(sizeof(char)*(strlen(buffer)+1));
strcpy(user_input,buffer);
user_input[strlen(buffer)+1] = '\0';
p_node = create_tree_node(user_input);   //this function append the new data to a new node, returns *TreeNode
insert_node_by_value(&amp;root,p_node,str_comp);
break;
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the error I get:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/b5Rvv.jpg"" alt=""Error Message""></p>

<p>BTW Freeing the node themselves is working fine!</p>

<p>The directory structure looks like:</p>

I've been reading through the documentation and ended here: <a href=""https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Developer+Guide#DeveloperGuide-JBossDeploymentStructureFile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Developer+Guide#DeveloperGuide-JBossDeploymentStructureFile</a></p>

<p>So, theoretically if I put the jboss-deployment-structure.xml on my WEB-INF folder (It is reading the XML because I failed writing properly the xsd and JBOSS crashed, and now without the xsd it says nothing) with this content:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;jboss-deployment-structure&gt;
    &lt;ear-subdeployments-isolated&gt;true&lt;/ear-subdeployments-isolated&gt;
    &lt;deployment&gt;
        &lt;!-- Exclusions allow you to prevent the server from automatically adding some dependencies     --&gt;
        &lt;exclusions&gt;
            &lt;module name=""org.apache.santuario.xmlsec"" /&gt;
        &lt;/exclusions&gt;
    &lt;/deployment&gt;
&lt;/jboss-deployment-structure&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I would be able to use my xmlsec 1.4.3 and the module of JBOSS would be disabled.</p>

<p>However this isn't working.</p>

In this project, there are products that can be customized by editing a list of parameters (specific to the product).
I'm trying to use ngRepeat in order to render, for each parameter, an input field with a customizable spinner, and a slider.</p>

<p>Since I didn't find suitable plugins/directives/whatever using pure angular, I had to resort to jQueryUI Slider and Spinner plugins.</p>

<p>After some trial and error (and some basic google-fu) I managed to bind the spinner and the slider to the same scope variable, using directives and trying to keep on the ""Angular path"" as much as possible.</p>

<p>Here's the working fiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/b8gs60fa/4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/b8gs60fa/4/</a></p>

<p>Then I tried implementing it using actual parameter data arranged inside an array of objects, and all hell broke loose.</p>

<p>Here's the broken fiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/wh3qv3rs/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/wh3qv3rs/1/</a></p>

<p>First of all, the slider stopped working. The console shows a jQueryUI error ""closestHandle is undefined"" whenever I try using a slider.</p>

<p>Also, now the slider will be updated by using the spinner, but the model itself will not change. If a value is manually typed into the textbox, then the model is correctly updated, but the slider is not.</p>

<p>My guess is that the problem is being caused by this:</p>

<pre><code>scope.$apply(function() {
    scope[attrs.ngModel] = (parseFloat(ui.value));
});
</code></pre>

<p>I'm thinking that data binding is working correctly (because typing in the textbox will change the label as well), but since ngRepeat creates a new scope for each iteration, I'm just referring to (and updating) the wrong object. Sadly, I have no idea how to fix this.</p>

<p>As for the ""closestHandle is undefined"" error, I have no clue of what's causing it to show up, and I'm secretly hoping that, by solving the binding issue, this one will automagically implode as well.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

The same problem occurs on IE8 and Firefox. However, IE8 renders the short panels vertically aligned to the top of the td, while Firefox renders them in the middle.</p>

        .panel-header{background-color: green; color: white;}
        .panel-body {border: 1px solid green; padding: 1px; height:100%;}
    &lt;/style&gt;

<pre><code>//js
Collection = new Meteor.Collection('collection');

Schemas.secondary = new  SimpleSchema({
    unitType: {
       type: String,
      autoform: {

    },
        units: {
        type: [ Schemas.secondary ]
    }
});

Collection.attachSchema(Schemas.primary);


//HTML
{{#autoForm collection=""Collection"" id=""someId"" type=""insert""}}
   {{&gt; afQuickField name='name'}} // this works
   {{&gt; afQuickField name='units'}} // this works
   {{&gt; afQuickField name='units.unitType'}} // this doesn't work :-(
{{/autoForm}}
</code></pre>

<p>The reason I'm doing this is because there are other properties in the secondary schema that I want to show conditionally, based on the value of the select box. I also tried to put a form inside a form and then run <code>{{#each afFieldNames name='""units""}}</code> but that didn't quite work either. Instead of giving me just the fields contained in units (i.e., the secondary schema), it looped through all fields of both primary and secondary.</p>

<p>Thoughts? I'm not married to this pattern but I can't think of another way.</p>

Just stopped the whole process. In any case removed the computedText and it now works. The compositeData formula that returns pItem to the custom control still fires way to often but I can't figure out how to stop that. It is all memory resident so it is probably not a major performance hit, but still.....</p>

<p>This question is a follow up to my previous question and I will try to refine the issue
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32789071/defining-an-object-property-in-a-compositedata-on-a-custom-control"">defining an object property in a compositeData on a custom control</a></p>

<p>Here is a picture of what I am trying to do:
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ii6w4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ii6w4.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The repeat control is bound to an arrayList generated by the Java method Payments.getAllItems(LinkKey) and that works correctly. The button in the repeat is fairly simple it just setts the viewScope.vsShowPayment = true and vsRIndex to the repeat Index value so I know which element in the ArrayList we are working with. It then does a refresh of the panelPaymentContainer which hides the repeat and renders the custom control ccTestPayment. 
ccTestPayment has a custom property called pItem of the type java.lang.Object with this code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xc:ccTestPaymentInput rendered=""#{javascript:(viewScope.vsShowPayment)}""&gt;
                &lt;xc:this.pItem&gt;&lt;![CDATA[#{javascript:try{
        var debug:Boolean = true;
        if (debug) print(""Open existing row = "" + viewScope.vsRIndex)
        rIndex = parseInt(viewScope.vsRIndex.toString());
        if (debug) print(""rIndex = "" + rIndex);
        pItem = Payments.getItem(rIndex);
        return pItem;

}catch(e){
    print(""Failure in Custom Prop of add item "" + e.toString());
    return null;
}}]]&gt;&lt;/xc:this.pItem&gt;
&lt;/xc:ccTestPaymentInput&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>the method in the class Payments Payments.getItem(rIndex) then returns the PaymentItem Object from the ArrayList of PaymentItems and displays them in custom control. the fields in the custom control are bound to compositeData.pItem.getPaymentDate etc and to this point everything is cool.</p>

<p>I can edit any of the fields on the custom control and that all works fine. However, when I press the ""Save"" button none of the code in it gets executed.</p>

<pre><code>try{
print(""Start Payment save"");
var debug:Boolean = true;

var pos:Integer = parseInt(viewScope.vsRIndex.toString());
if (debug) print(""Working with pos = "" +  pos + "" Call saveThisItem"");

if (Payments.saveThisItem(compositeData.pItem , pos)){
    if (debug) print(""save Payments Worked "");
}else{
    if (debug) print(""save Payments FAILED "");
}

}catch(e){
    print(""payment save Error "" + e.tostring);

}finally{
    viewScope.vsExpPayDate = null;
    viewScope.vsShowPayment = false;
    viewScope.remove(""vsRIndex"");
    viewScope.remove(""vsGotItem"")
}
</code></pre>

<p>None of the print statements get fired. I suspect it has something to do how pItem gets defined. the code behind the custom property gets fired over and over again and I'm wondering if that is getting in the way.</p>

<p>When I use Ctrl+P for my web page, the printable page looks just like the mobile version of my page. But how do I make it look like the desktop version? (media > 1024 px) Is there a way to do this?</p>

<p>The page looks good in XS for small devices, but printing in XS makes many elements look gigantic. So the question remains. Is there a way to make the printing page look the same as the layout for medium or large devices?

<p>I have an STA VB6 application. It is running on the same virtual server as a .net web application. There are two cores on that server.

It is also locking the core for some time while it makes out of apartment calls to the database. </p>

<p>If the VB6 application spends 1 minute on an out of apartment call, can i assume that the core is completely locked for one minute? In other words, can i assume that each core provides one hour of ""cpu time"" per hour for the VB6 application? So if i have two cores, can i also say that this setup provides 120 minutes of ""cpu time"" per hour?</p>

I've found the BlackLib library works realy well for controlling pins, but I'm having a little trouble integrating it into the larger scheme of things. If I simply create objects associated with pins and set them high or low (or somewhere in between) I am able to control the motor as desired. But when I try to create an object that contains BlackLib ojects, I run into difficulty. Seems to me, a good way to go about this would be to create a motor object that contains a GPIO and a PWM BlackLib object. Then I can create a function to easily set the power and direction with</p>

<p>I've got some of it working, but am having trouble accessing the functions within the objects from BlackLib that are within my own Motors class.</p>

<p>Here's the code I'm working with now.</p>

{

  BlackGPIO* gpio;

  void drive(int power)
  {
    if(power &gt;= 0)
    {

    }

    {
//      gpio.setValue(high);
//      pwm.setDutyPercent(100+power);
    }
  }
};

int main()
{
  struct Motors rightMotor;
  rightMotor.pwm = new BlackPWM(P9_16);
  rightMotor.gpio = new BlackGPIO(GPIO_49,output);

  //Give the BeagleBone a little time to create the objects
  usleep(10000);

  rightMotor.pwm.setPeriodTime(500000);
  //I will eventually need to set the period time but I'm not sure how. I'm guessing this is the incorrect syntax
  //Ideally, I would create a function so that I could simply write rightMotor.setPeriodTime(500000);

  sleep(1);
  rightMotor.drive(0);

I don't have much practical experience on it, since I seldom use it. Now my question is, Can all <strong>after trigger</strong> be replaced completely by <strong>instead of trigger</strong>? </p>

<p>To me <strong>instead of trigger</strong> is kind of a ""before trigger"" and it fires before the action happens. So we can do something useful, or roll the transaction back. Since we can do anything, we can <code>INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE</code>. To me it seems like I can use <strong>instead of trigger</strong> to completely replace <strong>after trigger</strong>.

<blockquote>
  <p>Since you're assigning to a scalar, the righthand side is in scalar
  context. The comma operator (yes, it's an operator!) in scalar context
  evaluates its lefthand side, throws away the result, and evaluates
  it's righthand side and returns the result. In effect, that
  <strong><em>list-lookalike</em></strong> assigns to <code>$scalar</code> it's rightmost value. Many people
  mess this up because they choose a <strong><em>list-lookalike</em></strong> whose last element
  is also the count they expect:</p>

<pre><code>my $scalar = ( 1, 2, 3 );  # $scalar gets 3, accidentally
</code></pre>

<p>What I understand this to mean is that there is no such thing as a list in scalar context.</p>

<p>However, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/589924/ikegami"">ikegami</a> maintains that it <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/8213792/133939"">""result[s] in a list operator, so it <em>is</em> a list literal.""</a></p>

<p>So, is it a list or not?</p>

<p>I am going crazy with this issue, I hope you have the answer for me as I have searched wide for this issue.  I have a WEB site that has implemented both the 'Like' button and the 'Comments' button.  The issue I'm having is actually two-fold:</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>:</p>

<p>The usual 'Admin Page' link that goes beside the 'Like' button once the Admin (me) has liked the page is not always present... I can't figure why, because they are exactly the same PHP pages with different info filled from the DB, but they have identical structure.  So I don't understand why:</p>

<ul>
<li>www.rafaelpolit.com/inicio/index.php?sid=14&amp;gim=10</li>
</ul>

<p>Shows me the Admin Page link, while</p>

<ul>
<li>www.rafaelpolit.com/inicio/index.php?sid=14&amp;gim=183</li>
</ul>

<p>Doesn't.
Any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>:</p>

<p>The above problem would not be much of an issue if the procedure described on the Open Graph Protocol page (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/#publishing) under Publishing would actually work!  Here's the actual problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>My page uses two parameters in the URL to define the page content: one is the section, the other is the image ID.</li>
</ul>

<p>My other pages that use a single URL attribute, work fine!!! So, if I access (I am using the graph for simplified purposes):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://graph.facebook.com/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rafaelpolit.com%2Finicio%2Findex.php%3Fsid%3D106"" rel=""nofollow"">https://graph.facebook.com/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rafaelpolit.com%2Finicio%2Findex.php%3Fsid%3D106</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It correctly shows:</p>

<pre><code>{
   ""id"": ""117419061672096"",
   ""name"": ""Rafael P\u00f3lit - Macro y Objetos"",
   ""picture"": ""http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/188186_117419061672096_2606222_s.jpg"",
   ""link"": ""http://www.rafaelpolit.com/inicio/index.php?sid=106"",
   ""likes"": 2,
   ""category"": ""Unknown"",
   ""website"": ""http://www.rafaelpolit.com/inicio/index.php?sid=106"",
   ""description"": ""-"",
   ""can_post"": true
}
</code></pre>

<p>But if I access the graph for one of the URLs with multiple arguments, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://graph.facebook.com/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rafaelpolit.com%2Finicio%2Findex.php%3Fsid%3D14%26gim%3D10"" rel=""nofollow"">https://graph.facebook.com/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rafaelpolit.com%2Finicio%2Findex.php%3Fsid%3D14%26gim%3D10</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It truncates the second argument and shows:</p>

<pre><code>{
   ""id"": ""http://www.rafaelpolit.com/inicio/index.php?sid=14""
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see if you enter this though:</p>

<ul>
<li>graph.facebook.com/159684077425429</li>
</ul>

<p>The Facebook page is actually correctly working!!! :( Is there a way to actually know a Page_ID if I cannot access the page from any place other than my own site?</p>

<p>So, to sum up my issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>For some pages I don't get the Admin Page link</li>
<li>For those pages, I have no way of knowing the Page_id</li>
<li>The graph options are not working for pages that have multiple URL arguments/parameters</li>
<li>In the exact same fashion, the <em>https://graph.facebook.com/feed</em> option does not send messages to the people that have 'liked' a page for those pages that have multiple URL parameters, it works fine for those with single parameter.</li>
</ul>

<p>How do I access the information of a page with two or more parameters?</p>

<p>My final goal is to make something like this actually WORK!:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$ogurl = urlencode(""http://www.rafaelpolit.com/inicio/index.php?sid=14&amp;gim=10"");
define(""FACEBOOK_APP_ID"", ""15xxxx84127xxxx"");
define(""FACEBOOK_SECRET"", ""xxxx5391830xxxx744b171f0d4b5xxxx"");

$mymessage = ""Thank you for 'Liking' my Picture."";

$access_token_url = ""https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token""; 
$parameters = ""grant_type=client_credentials&amp;client_id="" . FACEBOOK_APP_ID .
    ""&amp;client_secret="" . FACEBOOK_SECRET;
$access_token = file_get_contents($access_token_url . ""?"" . $parameters);

$apprequest_url = ""https://graph.facebook.com/feed"";
$parameters = ""?"" . $access_token . ""&amp;message="" .
    urlencode($mymessage) . ""&amp;id="" . $ogurl . ""&amp;method=post"";
$myurl = $apprequest_url . $parameters;

$result = file_get_contents($myurl);

// output the post id
echo ""post_id"" . $result;
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I repeat:  This works FINE! if I use the URL of pages with a single URL parameter, it does NOT work if I use URL of pages with multiple parameters.</p>

<p>Any insight?  This is a complex issue and I am not a native English speaker, so forgive the extension and any confusion.  I appreciate all and every help you may provide!</p>

<p>Thanks a lot,</p>

<p>Rafael Pólit.</p>

<p>ps. Please forgive the non-working links, since I'm new only two of them could actually be links. Most work as copy paste links though, except the graph link which needs https:// in the beginning.  Thanks for understanding.</p>

<p>It was also suggested that there were javascript errors on the page that were preventing the search from executing but I can't see any. Also, I don't think I'd get as far as the proxy error if that was the case.</p>

<p>So my inputs look roughly like this:</p>

table2
id  |  colA  | colB  | colC

table3

<pre><code>allTables

<p>In the above example all rows from table1 would have NULL values for colC and colD in allTables, all rows from table2 would have null values for colD, and all rows from table3 would have null values in colC.</p>

<p>A couple notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The column id is not the same or related between tables in any way</li>
<li>My example shows 3 tables, but I have about 8-9.</li>
<li>Duplicate rows exist within each source table and should be preserved.</li>

Now I know they should be all Unicode but because it is a library I don't think I want to force users to use decide or not. Ideally I thought it would be best to use <code>TCHAR</code> so I can build it either way for unicode code and ASCII users. Than I read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/234365/is-tchar-still-relevant"">this</a> and it opposes the idea in general.</p>

<p>As an example of API, the strings are filenames or error messages like below.</p>

<p>Now I think TCHAR is probably the best solution for me but do I have to use CString (internally) for that to work? Can I use it with STL string? As far as I can see, it is either string or wstring there. </p>

My problem is the following :</p>

<ol>
<li>in my site (html5, JQuery), there is a table. A feature of the site
is to export the table as a csv file which will be available for
download,</li>
<li><p>This feature is implemented as follow :</p>

<p>2.1 a javascript is called which extracts the data of the table,</p>

<p>2.2 this JS redirect to a php service and pass as arguments the datas. The code is the
following :</p></li>
</ol>

<p><code>var url= jmcnet.request.getOrigin()+'/commons/php/dt_csv_export.php' ;
location.href = url+""?action=generate&amp;csv_type=export_task&amp;csv_data="" +encodeURIComponent(csv);</code></p>

<p>2.3 The php script format the input (csv_data parameter), write a temporay file and returns the content of the temporary file. The code is the following :</p>

<pre><code>$h = @fopen($csv_file_name, 'w');
      fputcsv($h, $csv_row, ',', '""');
      fclose($h);
      // export file content to JS
      header('Content-Encoding: UTF-8');
   header('Content-Type: text/ csv; charset =UTF-8');
   header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=export-table.csv');
   header(' Pragma: no-cache');
   echo ""\xEF\xBB\xBF""; // UTF-8 BOM
   readfile($csv_file_name);
</code></pre>

<p>2.4 The php file delete (unlink) the temporary file and exit,</p>

<p>My problem is that when the table is long, the URL called is not valid and the JS call to Php is down.</p>

<p>So, I imagine the 3 following solutions but no one is evident and all leads to other problems :</p>

<ol>
<li>S1  : dont do a GET but a POST in JS. So the size of the csv_data
doesn't matter anymore. The problem is that I will have the content
of the csv file in JS var after the call succeed and I don't know or
find how to redirect to a page which content is in a JS var ? I
guess I will lose all header information doing this.</li>
<li>S2 : compress in JS the csv_data parameter and decompress it in Php.
I just don't know how to do that and if it possible ....</li>
<li>S3 : call the php with a POST. Modify the Php to return the URL of
the temporary file, and do a redirect in JS to this temporay URL.
The problems are that my Php must generate a file into a dir
directly visible on the Internet, the file name must be unique and
there is no way to simply delete the file after it has been read by
browser (and I hate cron or what else).</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm sure I'm not the first one to have this problem, so I need your help to see what is the best practice for this problem.</p>

<p>Oh, and I can't just strip the HTML either!</p>

<pre><code>git add --untracked

<p>If I have, say, six untracked files, I <em>could</em> stage them using <code>add</code> in interactive mode and the <code>add untracked</code> option, like so:</p>

<li>Using <code>CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci</code> when creating the databases.</li>

<li>Setting default mysql connection in my.conf as <code>default-character-set = utf8</code>, <code>collation-server = utf8_unicode_ci</code>, <code>init-connect='SET NAMES utf8'</code>, <code>character-set-server = utf8</code></li>

<p>Apparently, these are directives that declare a prefix for a given tag library. So for the tag library at <code>http://www.springframework.org/tags</code>, the prefix in our project will be <code>spring</code>. </p>

<p>The problem is, I went to the website <code>http://www.springframework.org/tags</code>, and it doesn't exist. The page returns an error. It seems like the project still works nonetheless. 
So where are these tag libraries actually being stored, and how can I find them (and what tags they contain)?</p>

<p>I realize that in ruby, duck typing means that we're not supposed to be overly concerned with what variable/parameters types but rather concern ourselves with how they behave. However, I am working in MacRuby which is bridged over the Cocoa Objective-C API and some of the Cocoa methods expect typed parameters. </p>

<p>For example, I have a ruby class that calls into the Objective-C API and must pass it an object of the NSURL class. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Alpha
  attr_accessor :model
  def initialize(hopefully_a_NSURL)
    # bridged from Objective-C API
    @model=NSManagedObjectModel.alloc.initWithContentsOfURL(hopefully_a_NSURL)    
  end # initialize  
end 
</code></pre>

<p>... and I would call it like so:</p>

<pre><code>#bridged from Objective-C API
u=NSURL.fileURLWithPath(p)
a=Alpha.new(u)
puts ""a=#{a.model}"" # =&gt; a=#&lt;NSManagedObjectModel:0x2004970e0
</code></pre>

<p>></p>

<p>... which works nicely.</p>

<p>However, if I were to slip up:</p>

<pre><code>a=Alpha.new(""Whoops, a string not a NSURL"" )
</code></pre>

<p>... it explodes messily with errors coming from the depths of the Objective-C API. </p>

<p>I can, of course, put in test that will prevent bad parameter for reaching the bridged objects:</p>

<pre><code>class Alpha
  attr_accessor :model
  def initialize(hopefully_a_NSURL)
    if hopefully_a_NSURL.class==NSURL
      @model=NSManagedObjectModel.alloc.initWithContentsOfURL(hopefully_a_NSURL) 
    end   
  end # initialize  
end 


u=NSURL.fileURLWithPath(p)
a=Alpha.new("""")
puts ""a=#{a}"" # =&gt; a=#&lt;Alpha:0x200399160&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... but I still get a live instance back. I even tried returning nil from initialize but it seems that ruby insist on always returning a live instance. </p>

<p>Everything I've read says that type checking is heavily frowned upon in ruby but perhaps I will have to make an exception in the case of MacRuby. Would this be a good use of exceptions in ruby or is there a more elegant solution? I'm a noob in ruby so assume I am approaching the problem from the wrong perspective. </p>

<p>vhdl is a description language, you describe how the hardware is supposed to works and there is an insanely complex compiler that make it real. How could it be possible to describe a cgi in vhdl ?</p>

<p>thank you</p>

<p>My issue is as follows: on attempting to use the facebook login button inside my app, the facebook app gets opened and I receive a <code>This app has no android key hashes configured. Configure your app key hashes at ...</code> error message. </p>

<p>At first I thought this was just me not saving my keyhashes in the right place or having an incorrect key hash, but after trying what I believe to be every method mentioned on Stack Overflow, I still cannot seem to log in.</p>

<p>To obtain my keyhash, I have tried both of the following methods:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Entering into terminal with the password <strong>android</strong></p>

<p><code>keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64</code></p></li>
<li><p>Using the Java method suggested by Facebook found in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26095167/how-to-assign-development-key-hash-for-a-device-and-not-an-emulator"">this answer.</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these methods produced the exact same key which I then inserted into the Facebook ""Development Key Hash"" Section on app setup.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/wbIk4.png"" alt=""Like So""></p>

<p>I am not sure why I am still receiving the error seeing that my keyhash is registered with the application. I even tried adding the keyhash to the release section to see if it would do any good but no luck. </p>

<p>I would appreciate any insight into the matter.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>div.fc-day-content {

In my App there are two UIBarButtonItems.
If I click on the first button called save-button, a UIActionSheet appears and ask me to save. When I accept the save process, the actual image should be saved in the library.</p>

<p>When I click to the second button called delete-button, the same request via UIActionSheet should start. After accepting the operation the image should be deleted.</p>

<p>For this I have two methods of IBAction and one for the UIActionSheet.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation of the methods</strong></p>

<pre><code>-(IBAction)save: (id) sender{
UIActionSheet* actionSheet = [[UIActionSheet alloc] initWithTitle: @""Sure to save?""delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:nil destructiveButtonTitle:nil otherButtonTitles: @""Save"",@""Cancel"",nil];
    actionSheet.tag = 100;
    [actionSheet showInView:self.view];
    [actionSheet release];
}
-(IBAction)bin: (id) sender{
UIActionSheet* actionSheet = [[UIActionSheet alloc] initWithTitle:@""Sure to delete?""delegate: self cancelButtonTitle:nil destructiveButtonTitle:nil otherButtonTitles:@""Delete"",@""Cancel"",nil];
    actionSheet.tag = 101;
    [actionSheet showInView:self.view];
    [actionSheet release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>By reason that ""willPresentActionSheet"" could not implement two times in a class, I use the tags to handle the save- and the delete button.</p>

<pre><code>-(void)willPresentActionSheet:(UIActionSheet*)actionSheet{
   if (actionSheet.tag == 100) {
        CGRect contextRect  = CGRectMake(0, 960, 768, 1004);
        UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(contextRect.size);  

    [self.view.layer renderInContext:UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()];
    UIImage *image1 = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
    UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum(image1, nil, nil, nil);

} else if (actionSheet.tag == 101) {
    imageView.image = nil; 

    NSString *filePath = [[[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath] stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""Default.png""];  
        [imageView setImage:[UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:filePath]];
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong> <br/>
When I press the delete-Button the actionSheet appears, but in the same time (before I allow to delete) the image is deleted yet.</p>

<p>What is wrong or what did I miss in my methods?
If there is a lack of clarity concerning my app or my problem, do not shy away from asking.</p>

<p>I've seen various examples of using UI automation to do this, but this only works with certain, what seems more recently developed applications in .NET.  I need to be able to get the text of any window.</p>

<p>I remember a while back, an application which behaved like a dictionary, where you could hover over some text with the mouse anywhere in Windows and it would show a tooltip with the definition.  Can this be achieved in C# &amp; .NET?</p>

<p>I've been using WinSpy to inspect the contents of the window which doesn't seem to work with UIA, and the ApplicationId shows up as empty or """".  I'm guessing that this particular element isn't supported by UIA.  I've also noticed when I tested with Notepad++, that it uses Scintilla, which also doesn't seem to play with UIA.</p>

<p>Perhaps if someone could show a reliable way of doing this with some other method, I could use a hybrid approach to my app. Use the UIA framework, and if this doesn't yield results, then it drops back down to some other method.</p>

<p>I have an HTML page where the width is constrained to a certain maximum. This text also has a lot of associated images in DIV tags, that are floated along the right.</p>

<p>I've made an example <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/8d2f6/7/"" rel=""nofollow"">JSFiddle</a> which is slightly exaggerated. The real life situation doesn't have so many floated elements. In any case, the more the containing blue bordered DIV approaches the maximum width, the vertical distance between the red bordered DIVs is not high enough, and the lower DIV gets pushed to the left. </p>

<p>So, <strong>I tried adding <code>clear: right;</code> to the DIVs</strong>, but then an added problem creeps in, which is that they clear relative to <em>everything</em>, including elements outside the containing DIV. The green bordered DIV outside the container pushes the red bordered DIVs down, which is not desired.</p>

<p>Is there a way to to force the red bordered DIVs to move under the DIVs above them, and constrain the effect to just within the blue containing DIV so that the green bordered DIV does not push the red bordered DIVs down? I am open to solutions that involve Javascript, though pure CSS would be ideal.</p>

<p>This is the CSS:</p>

<pre><code>#otherthing {
    height: 300px;
    width: 80px;
    border: green thin solid;
    float: right;
}

#container {
 max-width: 36em;
    border: blue thin solid;
}

.test {
    border: red thin solid;
    float: right;
    clear: right;
    height: 180px;
    width:60px;
}

<pre><code>security:

        Finance\CmsBundle\Entity\AuthUser:
            algorithm: md5
            encode_as_base64: false

<p>Before I started I tested it on a copy of a table on a database under FinanceCmsBundle:SystemAuthMailCentrum and it worked correctly. </p>

<p>Now aplication ends with ""Doctrine\ORM\ORMException</p>

<p><code>Unknown Entity namespace alias 'FinanceCzBundle'""</code></p>

<p>I have tried to switch them  (FinanceCzBundle with FinanceCmsBundle) in config.yml and it looks like the aplication knows only the default Bundle set in config.yml. Because after this switch it does not find FinanceCmsBundle.</p>

<p>So I have tried to use full routes like:</p>

<pre><code> providers:
        administrators:
            entity:
                class: Finance\CmsBundle\Entity\AuthUser
                property: username
        ussers:
            entity:
                class: Finance\CzBundle\Entity\SystemAuthMailCentrum
                property: username
</code></pre>

<p>After that I get different errors: <code>""Doctrine\Common\Persistence\Mapping\MappingException</code></p>

<p><code>The class 'Finance\CzBundle\Entity\SystemAuthMailCentrum' was not found in the chain configured namespaces Finance\CmsBundle\Entity""</code></p>

<p>Thanks a lot for any answer.</p>

<p>P.S : It would be easier to use one database, but the code is old and I would have to fix it on many places.</p>

<pre><code>datatype lexresult = INTEGER of string | REAL of string | EOF

val error = fn x =&gt; output(stdOut,x^""\n"");
val eof = fn () =&gt; EOF;
fun inc(j) = j := !(j) + 1;

<p>But the problem is that it detects only integers and reals starting in new line. I tried to give <code>(^ | "" ""+)</code> in start in place of <code>^</code> but then ml-lex gives error <code>ml-lex: syntax error, line 15: 
unhandled exception: Error</code>. What changes can I make to detect integers and reals in between the sentence like ""I have 5 books."" and the program should ignore all characters and should detect integer 5 only.</p>

<p>I also have one more problem. I think I have defined regular expression for real number something like that it should say that some thing is real only if number has only one zero after  <code>.</code> (dot) or some sequence of number from 0-9 but doesn't end in zero. But my program also detecting 5.00 and 5.600 as real number.</p>

<p>I had somewhat rewritten the hashing functions to be methods in a Hash object... upon instantiation, the algorithm is randomly set (based off of <code>hash_algos()</code>) and the pbkdf2 iterations is also randomly set.</p>

<p><strong>The main question here is: does it improve security? or does it even matter?</strong></p>

<p>Since the hash result is stored in the DB in the format of ALGORITHM:ITERATIONS:SALT:HASH, the password validation method will always work -- assuming the format doesn't change.</p>

<p><strong>A secondary question here is: what if we changed the format and somehow saved that in the database?</strong> </p>

<p>Such as: 1234:ALGORITHM:ITERATIONS:SALT:HASH, whereas the position of the numbers in the first set determine the order. 1 could be ""Algorithm"", 2 could be ""Iterations"", 3 could be ""salt"" and 4 could be ""hash""... then it could be stored like 4213:HASH:ITERATIONS:ALGORITHM:SALT</p>

<p>So, for example, this can result in:</p>

<p>Categories form a structure that looks like a tree, which means for example there's one big category with id 1, then sub categories like 3, 5, and 7, and each of those subcategories have their own children, so it's like <code>1 - 3 - [12, 51, 23]</code>, and <code>2 - 7 - [23, 44]</code>.</p>

<p>Each category that is a leaf contains many products. And each product contains a <code>popularity</code> column. What I want to achieve is to set popularity attribute in categories entity, and calculate it inside the getter method. </p>

<p>The first problem I see is that I'd have to use doctrine entity manager inside the categories entity, to get the corresponding products and popularity information. No idea how to do that.</p>

<p>And another problem is with recurrence. Categories table contains information if it's a leaf or not. If it is, I would just count all products inside this category. But if it's not a leaf, I would have to count all nested levels of products below this category. How would I do that?</p>

<p>So having an entity class:</p>

<pre><code>class Categories {
  private $category_id;
  private $isLeaf;
  private $popularity; // popularity sum of all products in this category
  public function getPopularity() {
    if($this-&gt;isLeaf() == true)
    {
      // do something
    }
    else
    {
      // do something else
    }
  }
}

class Product {
  private $popularity;
}

class Category_Product_Mapper {
  private $product_id;
  private $category_id;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas? Thanks!</p>

<p>One issue I'm running into is the case of mutating bound event handlers passed as props. More specifically, say I have a  that renders and array of  children:</p>

<p>In Parent:</p>

<pre><code>onChange: function(key, data) {
    ...
},

render: function() {
        return this.state.array.map(function(object, index) {
            return &lt;Child key={object.key} onChange={this.onChange.bind(key)} stuff={object.stuff}/&gt;
        }
    }) 
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Child:</p>

<pre><code>...
mixins: [PureRenderMixin]
...
</code></pre>

<p>It turns out that the PureRenderMixin always triggers an update inside the Child because its onChange prop is always a new instance (even though it's always bound to the same key). That is, each call to <code>anyFunction.bind(123)</code> generates a new value (ie. they are not ===).</p>

<p>How do people deal with this? Here's two ways I can think of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pass the unbound onChange handler, pass the key separately, and have the child call the onChange with the key itself -- this is a bit messy as it adds unecessary complexity to the child.</p></li>
<li><p>Cache the bound onChange handlers in the parent -- adds complexity to the parent (store them in a map? and for each handler?)</p></li>
<li><p>Have the PureRenderMixin skip the <code>on*</code> props -- this breaks when those handlers do change and are passed further down the hierarchy in the child.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I can't seem to find an elegant solution to this. Am I missing something?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I have a component in Flex who uploads a .XLS file to the server. 
This component has a <code>Progress Bar</code>and it updates its bar and the Label with the <code>fileref.addEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, progressHandler);</code></p>

<pre><code>private function progressHandler(event:ProgressEvent):void
{   
    uploadProgress.label = ""Uploading File %3%%"";
    uploadProgress.setProgress(event.bytesLoaded, event.bytesTotal);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I used the FileReference and all the things to acomplish this. I save the posted file in the server with something like this</p>

<pre><code>HttpFileCollection uploadedFiles = Request.Files;
string path = string.Empty;
string sFile = Request.Params[""Name""];
if (uploadedFiles.Count != 0)
{
   HttpPostedFile userPostedFile = uploadedFiles[0];
   if (userPostedFile.ContentLength &gt; 0)
   {
     path = Server.MapPath("".\\Uploads\\"") + sFile;
     userPostedFile.SaveAs(path);
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works perfectly fine, my bar and my label are refreshed ok, and my file is uploaded in a Temp folder and everything is ok, so going back to Flex I can listen when the file was uploaded through the <code>DataEvent.UPLOAD_COMPLETE_DATA</code>.
So When this event is dispatched I call a WebMethod of My WebService to Read that posted File and iterate over all the records. The file could have 65,000+ rows. So the info is updated row by row in a Oracle DB in some tables.</p>

<p><strong>What I'm trying to archieve is to have the same effect when the File is posted to the server. I want to have a progress Bar and show the % of rows uploaded to the Oracle DB.</strong></p>

<p>So what I Did in Flex was something like this:</p>

<pre><code>//Service is the WebService Instance
ShowPopUpProgress();
Service.wsUploadFileToDb(FileName);     
Service.wsUpdatePercentage();

protected function wsUpdatePercentage_result(event:ResultEvent):void
{           
    compProgress.uploadProgress.label = ""Uploading to DB %3%%"";
    compProgress.uploadProgress.setProgress(event.result.Actual,     event.result.Total);
    if(event.result.Actual  !=  event.result.Total)
    {
    Service.wsUpdatePercentage();
    }
    else
    {
         RemovePopUpProgress();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And in C# I did this</p>

<pre><code>[WebMethod(EnableSession = true)] 
public void wsUploadFileToDb(string fileName)
{
    HttpContext.Current.Session[""Total""] = 0;
    HttpContext.Current.Session[""Actual""] = 0;
    //... And in the Loop
     HttpContext.Current.Session[""Total""] = myDataTable.Rows.Count;
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; myDataTable.Rows.Count; i++)                   
      {
                        HttpContext.Current.Session[""Actual""] = i + 1;
      }

}



 [WebMethod(EnableSession = true)]
    [XmlInclude(typeof(Percentage ))]
    public Percentage wsUpdatePercentage()
    {
     Percentage oPercentage= new Percentage ();
        if (HttpContext.Current.Session[""Total""] != null)
        {
            oPercentage.Total = Convert.ToInt32(HttpContext.Current.Session[""Total""]);
            oPercentage.Actual= Convert.ToInt32(HttpContext.Current.Session[""Actual""]);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I dont know if at This point you  understand what I want to do. I dont know if this is the best way, or there is another way to archieve my goal. But thats what I have so Far. And for some reason this is not working, The Session variables are stored correctly in the
    wsUploadFileToDb method but i Can't see them in the wsUpdatePercentage, they just dont ""share"" the session. I debugged both methods and the session ID is different. So The session is not being shared. I dont know what else to do. My First page in the Site is an aspx.. I put a dummy variable in session, because i read in one post that you had to do it, to start the session in the webservices but still not luck.</p>

<p>Any help would be really appreciated.</p>

<p>First, I have a function at the beginning of the file that is used to connect to the database. (it is present in a <code>functions.php</code> file and <code>required</code> at the beginning of each page, thus the globalization). This function doesn't have anything wrong with it (as far as I know).</p>

<pre><code>function SQLConnect () {
// Database connection variables
$host = ""localhost"";
$dbname = ""dropbox"";
$user = ""root"";
$password = ""ethan17458"";

// Connect to the database
try {

//put $connect in global scale of document
 global $connect;

 // attempt to connect to database
 $connect = new PDO(""mysql:host=$host;dbname=$dbname"", $user, $password);

// Sets error mode
$connect-&gt;setAttribute( PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION );



} catch (PDOException $e) {

// Retrieves error message if connection fails
echo $e-&gt;getMessage();

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This function uses PDO to connect to the database containing the user's information.</p>

<p>Next is the script to retrieve the user's data</p>

<pre><code>// Test user in database
$test = ""e"";


try {

//confirms running of ""try"" block
echo ""tried"";

//database information
$host = ""localhost"";
$dbname = ""dropbox"";
$user = ""root"";
$password = ""ethan17458"";




//Prepare statement from connection function
// username_raw is ""e""
//username should be e1671797c52e15f763380b45e841ec32 (md5)
$statement = $connect-&gt;prepare(""SELECT `username` FROM `users` WHERE `username_raw` = ':name'"");

//create placeholder for prepared statement
$statement-&gt;bindParam("":name"", $test);

//make the statement fetch in an associative array
$statement-&gt;setFetchMode(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

//execute the prepared statement
$statement-&gt;execute();

//set $get_result to the fetched statement
$get_result = $statement-&gt;fetch();

//attempt to display the data fetched in $get_result
echo ""&lt;br /&gt;"";
echo ""&lt;pre&gt;"";

//Outputs 1 for some reason
// **not working**
echo print_r($get_result);


echo ""&lt;/pre&gt;"";
echo ""&lt;br /&gt;"";

} catch (PDOException $e) {
//confirm running of ""catch"" block
echo ""caught"";

// echo error message
echo $e-&gt;getMessage();

}
</code></pre>

<p>When I run this script I get this output:</p>

<pre><code>tried

1
</code></pre>

<p>In this output, <code>tried</code> is the confirmation that the ""try"" statement was processed, and the <code>1</code> is where I start to run into problems.</p>

<p>If the script was working as I would like, the script would retrieve the data <code>e1671797c52e15f763380b45e841ec32</code> from the database because it is the column <code>username</code> where the <code>username_raw</code> is <code>e</code>, as is stated in the PDO prepared statement. </p>

As system grew, it appeared that it is required to run this app extremely frequently (like 80 times in 5 mins) which leads to certain performance issues. In particular it creates all its objects over and over again which leads to filling up to 60MB RAM in one run (can be easily calculated how severely ROM/swap is used).</p>

<p>I want to migrate it to a service running mode which will simply take certain params and return formatted output. But:</p>

<ol>
<li>App is always triggered by a bat/sh script (this can't be changed)</li>
<li>Both script and app are on the same host server</li>
</ol>

<p>So, I'm wondering how it would be better to perform the communication of a script and a service?</p>

<p>P.S.: Sorry that I didn't mention, it's a standalone app, it will never use a server or anything like that as it appears to be redundant. Solution should be as simple as possible and extremely lightweight.</p>

<p>Example: The simplest thing I can think of by now is never to migrate it (I know it's contradictory ;)) and simply introduce a DB where all thee result will be stored and an app will have it's own schedule of when to trigger. Whenever it is triggered with any params, it should simply search the latest result in DB and return it. Easy,  light, fast, and working. :)</p>

<p>The only problem is:</p>

<p><strong>I am finding it hard to conceptualize a recursive algorithm that builds every possible letter combination when starting at once place in the grid.</strong></p>

<p>Here's code I already have written that I deem a big step in the right direction:</p>

<pre><code>/* 
* This is the method that calls itself repeatedly to wander it's way
* through the grid using a 4 way pattern,
* creating every possibly letter combination and checking it against a
* dictionary. If the word is found in the dictionary, it gets added to a
* collection of found words.
* 
* Here an example of a 3x3 grid with the valid words of RATZ and BRATZ, but
* the word CATZ isn't valid. (the C is not tangent to the A).
* 
* CXY
* RAT
* BCZ
*
* @param row Current row position of cursor
* @param col Current column position of cursor
*/
private void 4WaySearch(int row, int col) {

    // is cursor outside grid boundaries?
    if (row &lt; 0 || row &gt; ROWS - 1 || col &lt; 0 || col &gt; COLS - 1)
        return; 

    GridEntry&lt;Character&gt; entry = getGridEntry(row, col);

    // has it been visited?
    if (entry.hasBreadCrumb())
        return; 

    // build current word
    currentWord += entry.getElement(); // returns character

    // if dictionay has the word add to found words list
    if (dictionary.contains(currentWord))
        foundWords.add(currentWord);

    // add a mark to know we visited
    entry.toggleCrumb();

    // THIS CANT BE RIGHT
    4WaySearch(row, col + 1);   // check right
    4WaySearch(row + 1, col);   // check bottom
    4WaySearch(row, col - 1);   // check left
    4WaySearch(row - 1, col);   // check top

    // unmark visited
    entry.toggleCrumb();

    // strip last character
    if (currentWord.length() != 0)
        currentWord = currentWord.substring(
        0, 
        (currentWord.length() &gt; 1) ? 
            currentWord.length() - 1 : 
            currentWord.length()
        );
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my head, I visualize the search algorithm just like a recursive tree traveral algorithm, but each node (entry in this case) has 4 children (tangent entrys), and the leaf nodes are the boundaries of the grid. </p>

<p>Also, the location of the cursor upon initial entry into the function is determined by a simple for loop psuedocoded here:</p>

<pre><code>for (int r = 0; r &lt; ROWS; r++)
  for (int c = 0; r &lt; COLS; c++)
    4WaySearch(r,c);
  end for;
end for;
</code></pre>

<p>I have been thinking about this for a while now, and trying different approaches... but I still cant seem to wrap my mind around it and make it work. Can someone show me the light? (For the sake of me and your grandmother! :D)</p>

I'm using it in a MVC app and what I want to happen is that the user picks the files they want to upload, it uploads them and then displays a page showing all the files they have uploaded so they can add a description and select where to save them, and then save the files.</p>

<p>At the moment when files are uploaded the flash component calls a controller to process the files, this bit works fine, I can get the uploaded files and do what I like with them. The problem is is that I cannot just redirect to a View once the controllers done its work, because its the flash component calling the controller, not the page and so nothing happens when you try and do that.</p>

<p>I had attempted to save the files in the session and then forward the user on completion of the upload using some code in the flash actionscript, this however does not work, the session always turns up null. I had also considered actually saving the files to a temp location and then on the displaying page just listing all files in the temp location, but this is then going to involve saving the files twice, once to the temp directory and then to the actual place the user wants to put them, which I assume will be slow.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on the best way to do this?</p>

<p>I am trying to take the given value and drop it into the detail text of a table cell for display. </p>

<p>The problem is that when I try to coerce the value into an <code>NSString</code> I get a crash, which I <em>think</em> is because I'm trying to coerce <code>Null</code> into a string.</p>

<p>What's the right way to do this?</p>

<p>What I want to do is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>cell.detailTextLabel.text = sensor.objectForKey( ""latestValue"" ) as NSString
</code></pre>

<p>Here's an example of the Dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>Printing description of sensor:
{
    ""created_at"" = ""2012-10-10T22:19:50.501-07:00"";
    desc = ""&lt;null&gt;"";
    id = 2;
    ""latest_value"" = ""&lt;null&gt;"";

    ""sensor_type"" = temp;
    slug = ""ac-vent-temp"";
    ""updated_at"" = ""2013-11-17T15:34:27.495-07:00"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I just need to wrap all of this in a conditional, that's fine. I just haven't been able to figure out what that conditional is. Back in the Objective-C world I would compare against <code>[NSNull null]</code> but that doesn't seem to be working in Swift.</p>

<p>For example:
with each update the set should move 50px to the right, after 10 slow updates (lets say  one update per 2 seconds), the set is 500px to the right, everything is OK.</p>

<p>Problem is, when I receive too many new positions too fast:<br>
(e.g. one update per 200ms),then the set is 300, or 350 or 400 or 450 instead of 500px to the right. </p>

<p>I think the problem is that the animation does not have enough time to finish before new animation is triggered. I tried  lowering the animation time from 400ms to 200, but with little success, it still sometimes happened.</p>

<p>So current code is generating the JSON from XML generically that is JSON has all of its tags and their structure same as present in the XML file.</p>

<p>but i want JSON tags to have some specific format always irrespective of the input xml.</p>

<p>For example here is the code snippet for perl code, input XML, generically generated JSON and  expected JSON.</p>

<p>XML file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""no"" ?&gt;
&lt;Person SchemaVersion=""1.0.8""&gt;
    &lt;personalData&gt;

                 ""fileName"": ""/usr/temp/RPM_020515_.tar.gz"",
            &lt;/file&gt;
        &lt;/workList&gt;
    &lt;/personalData&gt;
&lt;/Person&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Perl code:</p>

<pre><code> #!/usr/bin/perl
 use strict;
 use warnings FATAL =&gt; qw( all );
 use Data::Dumper;

 use JSON;

    # Create the object of XML Simple
    my $xmlSimple = new XML::Simple(KeepRoot   =&gt; 1);

    # Load the xml file in object
    my $dataXML = eval { $xmlSimple-&gt;XMLin(Input_XML_File_Path)};

    # use encode json function to convert xml object in json.
    my $jsonString = encode_json($dataXML);

    print $jsonString;
</code></pre>

<p>Current Output JSON:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""Person"":{

       ""personalData"": {
          ""workList"": {
             ""file"":{
                ""fileName"": ""/usr/temp/ABC.txt""
               }
           },
       }
    }
 } 
</code></pre>

<p>New output to generate:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""Person"":{

       ""personalData"": {
          ""workList"": {
             ""file"":[
                 { ""fileName"": ""/usr/temp/ABC.txt"" }
              ]
           },
         ""eventList"": {
            ""event"": [
                 {}
             ]
          }
        }
      }   
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Difference between current JSON output generated to what needs to be generated:</p>

<p>1> Tag file needs to be pursued as an array here instead of a normal tag.
This is stupid since input tag has just one value so no point having as array but next step of process is expecting the tag as nested so need to make that change. </p>

<pre><code>    ""file"":[
        { ""fileName"": ""/usr/temp/ABC.txt"" }
      ]
</code></pre>

<p>INSTEAD of following:</p>

<pre><code>    ""file"":{
        ""fileName"": ""/usr/temp/ABC.txt""
      }
</code></pre>

<p>2> Tag Eventlist is not present in the input xml file so need to hard code, so that output JSON has always that tag inside it. ( next step of process needs that ). </p>

<p>let me know if any questions.</p>

<p>NOTE: i am able to add new tag into JSON but not in the way i wanted.</p>

<pre><code> my $tempHash = decode_json($jsonString );
 # adding the new key-value pair into the hash map
 $tempHash-&gt;{'Person'}-&gt;{'PersonalData'}-&gt;{'workList'}-&gt;{$key} = $val;
 # encoding the hash map back into JSON

<p>Write a Function procedure that returns the index of a property in the propListBox when the property satisfies search conditions. This function will be called by both event handlers of Search and SearchNext Buttons later on.</p>

<p>Use the following procedure header. (This function will be used for implementing the requirement #12 and #13.) </p>

<p>The first parameter is the Index in the list of properties that the search will start from. The second parameter is the search criterion for number of bedrooms, the third for number of bathrooms, and the fourth for state. If 0 is passed as parameter for bedroom/bathroom, that means user does not specify a search criterion for bedroom/bathroom. If Nothing is passed as parameter for state, that means user does not specify a search criterion for State.</p>

<p>If you have multiple conditions, you should find a property that satisfies all conditions. (For example, if ‘0’ is given for the startIndex (meaning you will start the search from the first property), and if 3 is passed as parameter for bedroom and 3 is passed for bathroom, the first property that satisfies both conditions is the property with the address ‘1314 Fern Ave, Orlando, FL 32814’.</p>

<p>Use loop structures to go through each property and compare #of bedroom, #of bathroom and state of the property with the parameters passed to the function. Note the info about properties is stored in nbeds, nbaths, and states arrays.</p>

<p>The property search should start from the startIndex and should stop when the first property that satisfies all conditions is found. </p>

<p>This function should return the index (in propListBox) of the found property. If not found, the function returns -1. </p>

<p>Two classes, Student and Homework.  Student class has a list of their many homework assignments.  Homework class has a list of its many students to complete it.</p>

<p>Some example code just in case someone searches for a quick Many to many example:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity(name=""STUDENT"")
@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.JOINED)//Note this join type, no redundancy    
public class Student {

@Id

private int id;

@ManyToMany(mappedBy=""studentList"")//Note how this is mapped

@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.JOINED)    
public class Homework {

@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
private int id;

@ManyToMany
private Collection&lt;Student&gt; studentList = new ArrayList&lt;Student&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Hibernate does its thing and creates a table, student_homework using primary keys to map each homework assignment to students and vice versa.</p>

<p>How could I possibly use Hibernate to save a 'homeworkCompleted' boolean for example.
This value cannot exist in the student class as there are many jobs, the same with the homework class as there are many students.</p>

<p>One possible solution would be to possibly manually go into the db, create another column and each time an entry is saved have the option to update the completed or do it sometime later.</p>

<p>I can't help but think there is a very very simple solution out there that hibernate can take care of and make everything ok, with a little applied logic as well.</p>

<p>Now that I have added it, there are weird things happening.
This is the order in which I load the js files</p>

<pre><code>   bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(""~/bundles/jquery"").Include(
                ""~/Scripts/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"",

                ""~/Scripts/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js""));
</code></pre>

<p>the layout page loads this js files in the same order that I have mentioned
So my _layout page has</p>

<pre><code>@Scripts.Render(""~/bundles/jquery"")
@Scripts.Render(""~/bundles/jqueryval"")      
@Scripts.Render(""~/bundles/modernizr"")
@Scripts.Render(""~/Scripts/jquery-ui-1.10.4.js"")
@Scripts.Render(""~/bundles/bootstrap"")
@Scripts.Render(""~/bundles/Kendo"")
@Scripts.Render(""~/bundles/toastr"")
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I submit ajax form from view</p>

<pre><code>@using (Ajax.BeginForm(""AddAttendeeInternalAddressBook"", ""Attendee"", new AjaxOptions { HttpMethod = ""POST"", OnSuccess = ""doneInternalAddressBook"" }))
{
     @Html.AntiForgeryToken()
     @Html.ValidationSummary()

    &lt;div class=""form-group""&gt;             
        @Html.TextBoxFor(m =&gt; m.SelectedAddressBookPerson.Email, new {@class = ""form-control"", PlaceHolder = ""Search in AddressBook..."" }) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;               
        &lt;input type=""submit"" id=""btnAddressBook"" class=""btn btn-default"" value=""Add&gt;&gt;""&gt;           
    &lt;/div&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This controller's method runs twice</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult AddAttendeeInternalAddressBook(CreateAppointmentSelectPersons internalAddressbookPerson)
{
    bool result = _attendeeRepository.CheckIfAttendeeExists(internalAddressbookPerson.SelectedAddressBookPerson.AppointmentId, internalAddressbookPerson.SelectedAddressBookPerson.Email);
    if (!result)
    {
        _attendeeRepository.AddInternalAddressBookAttendee(
        internalAddressbookPerson.SelectedAddressBookPerson.AppointmentId,
        internalAddressbookPerson.SelectedAddressBookPerson.FirstName,
        internalAddressbookPerson.SelectedAddressBookPerson.LastName,
        internalAddressbookPerson.SelectedAddressBookPerson.Email);
    }

    return Json(new { AttendeeExists = result, ErrorMessage = ""Person already exists in your list"" });  
}
</code></pre>

<p>So when I put breakpoint on this action's first line and post the form, the first line</p>

<pre><code>bool result = _attendeeRepository.CheckIfAttendeeExists(internalAddressbookPerson.SelectedAddressBookPerson.AppointmentId, internalAddressbookPerson.SelectedAddressBookPerson.Email);
</code></pre>

<p>gets executed twice. Then the if statement gets executed twice then the repository method gets called twice.</p>

<p>So basically all the lines are being executed twice. And the person is is being added to my database twice.</p>

<p>But when I remove the line (not load)</p>

<pre><code>  ""~/Scripts/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.min.js""
</code></pre>

<p>everything is fine.
The action in controller gets executed once (the way it should).</p>

<p>I also have UnobtrusiveJavascriptEnabled to true</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;appSettings&gt;
    &lt;add key=""webpages:Version"" value=""3.0.0.0"" /&gt;
    &lt;add key=""webpages:Enabled"" value=""false"" /&gt;
    &lt;add key=""ClientValidationEnabled"" value=""true"" /&gt;
    &lt;add key=""UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled"" value=""true"" /&gt;
  &lt;/appSettings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>Can anyone explain what is happening. </p>

<p>Why are controller's action's each line being executed twice when I submit ajax forms?</p>

<p>Since, I'm dealing with color images, can I just take rgb values of each pixel as one value or should I calculate the mean and SD for every color differently?</p>

<p>For example if I have r=255, g=255, b=255, can I take pixel value as (in binary), (r&lt;&lt;16)+(g&lt;&lt;8)+b ?</p>

<p>My problem is the following:
Fist I have two entities Associated and Address (an associated have many addresses).</p>

<p>The webpage have a editable kendoGrid listing the associated (the datasource contains all the associated each with a list of their adressses) and when I click the edit button a popup appears with the data and an editable kendoGrid with the list of addresses. I click on the edit button the edit address popup appears but the update button don't work and the cancel button deletes the row.</p>

<p>the following is my code</p>

<p><strong>Datasource</strong></p>

<pre><code>associatedDS = 
new kendo.data.DataSource({        
 data: Data,
 schema: {
  model: {
   id: ""AsociatedID"",
   fields: {
    Associated: { type: ""string"", editable: false, nullable: true },
    Addresses: { type: ""object"", validation: { required: true } }                        
   }
  }  
 }
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Grid Associated</strong> </p>

<pre><code>var Associated = 
$(""#kgrd_Associated"").kendoGrid({
 columns: [
 { field: ""AsociatedID"", title: ""Direccion"", width: ""100px"", },
 { field: ""Associated"", title: ""Direccion"", width: ""100px"", },
 { field: ""Addresses"", title: ""Addresses"", width: ""350px"", editor:addressGridEditor, template: ""#= Addresses.length #"" },
 { command: [""edit"", ""destroy""], title: ""&amp;nbsp;"", width: ""150px""  }
],
dataSource: associatedDS,
editable: ""popup"",
height: 400,
pageable: true,
scrollable: true,
sortable: true,
selectable: ""row"",
}).data(""kendoGrid""); 
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Grid Address</strong></p>

<pre><code>function editor:addressGridEditor(container, options) {  
 var repgrid = $('&lt;div id=""kgrd_Address"" data-bind=""source:' + options.field + '""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;')
 .appendTo(container)
 .kendoGrid( {
  columns: [                    
   { field: ""Address"",   title: ""Address"", width: ""150px""   },
   { command: [""edit"", ""destroy""],   title: ""&amp;nbsp;"", width: ""150px""  }
  ],
  editable: ""popup"",
  scrollable: true,
  selectable: ""row"",
  autoBind: true                
  }).data(""kendoGrid"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The binding is working fine, but the datasource of kgrd_Address is not being generated correctly because is missing the schema (needed to update) and _pristineData (needed to cancel).</p>

<p>I don't know if i'm missing something or if there is a workaround this. Take into account that I may have more than one kendoGrid inside the popup like idk, kgrd_contacts.</p>

<p>So I try to use ctypes but I have problems to get the variable ""result"". Indeed, in the following script, the value of searchReturn is c_char_p(b'0') whereas with the autoit script, I have a string with '|' inside it.</p>

<pre><code>from ctypes import *

ImageSearchDLL = windll.LoadLibrary(""ImageSearchDLL"")
ImageSearch = ImageSearchDLL.ImageSearch
searchReturn = c_char_p(ImageSearch(0,0,1919,1079,'myPic.bmp'))

print(searchReturn)
</code></pre>

<p>I also try to pass arguments with c_int, etc. and it leads to the same problem. If I don't use the c_char_p(), I have an int. I don't understand why I got an int, the header shows that it should return a str.</p>

<p>I am implementing simple click and page tracking in my Android app using GA, running this through GTM. All my ""Screens"" are visible in realtime in GA but I can't get ""Events"" to appear at all.</p>

<p>Well actually I can but the behaviour seems very bizarre. If I do not include a ""Label"" and a ""Value"" I can see the events appear. However if I add them (either as just a constant or a data layer variable) all events stop. I have confirmed the variables I want in ""Label"" and ""Value"" are coming through as I made a container with those values as ""Category"" and ""Action"" and could see them as expected in real time.</p>

<p>This leads me to think the app side implementation is perfectly fine but there is an issue with my tag in GTM. (Obviously not the Trigger as that too works when expected).</p>

<p>Ideally I would like to do something like this (the variables are data layer variables):</p>

<p><strong>Edited</strong>
These are large postscript files (more than 200 Mb) and their purpose is only for color printing (not for online viewing).</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>ps2write is not the answer as it
does not support DSC. </li>
<li>pswrite as reader pipitas has correctly pointed out produces L1 output. It is not the soluton.</li>
<li>Using pdfwrite is workable. In this option, we convert two ps to a PDF and then convert the merged PDF to a ps. There may be a problem with this solution as there may be some information lost during the conversion. Besides the extra conversion steps take additional resources and time.</li>
<li>If we do not need to view the output file, concatenating two postscript file together with the following line ""false 0 startjob pop"" inserted in between the files is also a solution. (See also <a href=""http://www.inkguides.com/merging-extracting-and-converting-postscript-files.asp"">this link</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, the interim solution to merge two postscript files are option 3 or 4.</p>

<p>There seem to be a whole bunch of different approaches I could use to have this function called:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/CreatingThreads/CreatingThreads.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Multi-Threading</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/Library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSTimer_Class/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Timers</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ConcurrencyProgrammingGuide/OperationQueues/OperationQueues.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Dispatch Queues</a></li>
<li>God knows what else... :)</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried calling my animation-function from a separate thread first, but while the thread does run, I don't see any screen updates until I trigger a refresh manually with a device rotation, so I must be missing some step where I call the update functions from inside the GUI Thread instead of my own or invalidating the View or something... But I don't even know if this is the best approach...</p>

<p>What is the preferred way to keep calling a function (for an animation, for example) as quickly as possible (or with a small delay of 10ms or so) without blocking the GUI and in such a way that if this function, for example, changes the background color or position of a view, the screen gets updated?</p>

<p>If possible, I would like to use a method that is as backward-compatible as possible, so preferably something that doesn't use any features introduced in iOS 8.1 (exaggeration)... :)</p>

<p>I created my private key, certificate key and self signed certificate using OpenSSL when I SSH'ed into the EC2 instance under the ec2-user. In some cases, I've seen people have these files in <code>/var/www/html/.</code> I have the files in the home directory, would that cause a problem?</p>

<p>Any ideas of how to diagnose this or is there a better approach to setting up SSL on a single EB instance?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

After seeing somebody using a new text editor that had amazing colors, I decided to venture down the colorscheme path.  This worked great for about 24 hours and then i decided i wanted to add a bunch of plugins which required me to recompile my VIM.  After doing so (using vim73), I NO longer can get any colors in my vim.  It is black and white with a foggy background.  My .vimrc file has not changed neither has the color scheme i was using, zenburn.  </p>

<p>I get no errors, except that the colors just aren't working.</p>

<p>I did a</p>

<pre><code>strace -o vim_strace vim
</code></pre>

<p>to make sure that my .vimrc file was being loaded but still nothing.  I'm wondering if i have some legacy file that is actually get read after the fact and overwriting my desired colors.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on this one??? Pretty much stranded with no way out.</p>

<p>UPDATED INFO:
@epsilonhalbe: I used this build of VIM and configuration options:</p>

<pre><code>hg clone https://vim.googlecode.com/hg/ vim
./configure --enable-rubyinterp
make
</code></pre>

<p>This killed my colors.  I couldn't find a 'colors' option in the configuration file.</p>

<p>@kev:I tried running a colors:zenburn which did nothing, however, trying another scheme like color:desert does in fact change the colors, BUT, everything is still black and white, just various shades.  Its like i am using black and white instead of colors, but it appears that it is reading and applying the scemes, just incorrectly.</p>

<pre><code>void foo(int* x) {

    } catch(...) {
        delete x;

<p>It warns on the <code>*x;</code> line that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Freed memory shouldn't be subsequently accessed under any circumstances</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Somehow it's concluded that control flow can pass into the <code>catch(...)</code> block, delete <code>x</code>, go past the <code>throw;</code>, and make it to <code>*x;</code>. I tried <code>throw std::exception("""");</code> and a couple others and got the same thing. Parasoft certainly knows about exceptions and incorporates them into its control flow, because there are many other tests that involve exception checking. Is it just confused in this case, or is there actually some way for the execution of this program to hit both <code>delete x;</code> and <code>*x;</code>?</p>

<p>However, with glfwMakeContextCurrent() I have been unable to make this possible.

<p>As you can see, the code first checks if the button's title is ""Select"" or ""Done"", and if it is select it slides in the UIPickerView.

The button title does not change. After this initial glitch, it works fine.</p>

<p>If you know why this might be happening, or can think of a quick fix for it, I would really appreciate it.</p>

<p><a href=""http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/98315-Using-Unity-Android-In-a-Sub-View"">http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/98315-Using-Unity-Android-In-a-Sub-View</a> .</p>

<p>Initially the application is correctly displaying the UnityPlayer inside an activity called ""UnityActivity.java"". </p>

<p>The problem starts when the user navigates back to the MainActivity (by either pressing the hardware back button or clicking on the ActionBar back button) and then tries to re-open the UnityActivity - in which case a black screen is shown instead of the UnityPlayer. A user in the forums suggested forwarding the onPause and onResume lifecycle events to the UnityPlayer, as shown in the code bellow. When doing that, however, the following errors show up and the app crashes.</p>

<p>This is logged when navigating to the UnityActivity for the first time:</p>

<p><code>W/libc(21095): pthread_create sched_setscheduler call failed: Operation not permitted</code></p>

<p>This error is logged when clicking the back button:</p>

<p><code>W/Choreographer(20963): Already have a pending vsync event.  There should only be one at a time.</code></p>

<p>This error is logged when navigating to the UnityActivity for the second time:</p>

<p><code>A/libc(21095): Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV) at 0x00000000 (code=1), thread 21176 (Thread-5073)</code></p>

   foreach(var role in roles)

<p>I want to use the UserManager.IsInRoleAsync and UserManager.AddToRoleAsync methods and would like to run these in parallel and then halt execution of the thread until everything is completed. I've not done asynchronous threading before, but it appears that I could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public async Task&lt;JsonResult&gt; UserRoles(string userid, string[] roles)
{
   IList&lt;Task&lt;IdentityResult&gt;&gt; tasks = new List&lt;Task&lt;bool&gt;&gt;();

   }

   await Task.WhenAll(tasks);

<p>However, I somehow need to account for the conditional logic of checking if the user is already in the role -- i.e. UserManager.IsInRoleAsycn(userid, role).  I'm not sure how to check for that and conditionally add Users to roles all in parallel and asynchronously.</p>

<p>I've seen the ContinueWith method mentioned and it seems like maybe that somehow applies but I can't figure out how that would be implemented.  Something like:</p>

<pre><code>UserManager.IsInRoleAsync(userid, role).ContinueWith(t =&gt; if(t.Result) { UserManager.AddToRole(userid, role)} ;);

"25545132","1","","","2014-08-28 09:17:34","","1","146","<p>I have a Shiny UI that starts with two plots and corresponding input fields for each plot. The general structure looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;header&gt;
&lt;main&gt;
  &lt;plotarea1&gt;
    &lt;inputs1&gt;
    &lt;chart1&gt;
  &lt;/plotarea1&gt;
  &lt;plotarea2&gt;
    &lt;inputs2&gt;
    &lt;chart2&gt;
  &lt;/plotarea2&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I am able to add and remove plotareas dynamically with two buttons. This works perfectly, except that the whole main area gets re-rendered if I change the number of charts. This is not so bad from a computational point of view (it's only the rendering, not the data fetching that gets re-executed) but as the inputs are re-rendered their values are reset to defaults. This, in turn, forces the charts to change as well.</p>

<p>Therefore, my question is: How can I dynamically add a plotarea (list of inputs + plot), such that the existing plotareas are not affected by this?</p>

<p>I'd say that I have to isolate the numcharts reactive and manually trigger the rendering code once I have manually added a plotarea within the add/remove functions. This implies that I save the list of plotareas and then just append/remove elements to/from the list. However, this led to some strange errors (which I unfortunately cannot remember, though)  </p>

<p>The server.R looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>observe({
   lapply(1:numcharts(),function(i){
      output[[paste0(""plot"",i)]] &lt;- renderPlot({
        dataset &lt;- react[[paste0(""dataset"",i)]]()
        plotValues(dataset)
      })
   })    
})

observe({
    output$charts &lt;- renderUI({
      lapply(1:numcharts(), function(i) {
        list(
          fluidRow(
            column(2,
                   selectInput(paste0(""selectedInput"",i),
                               label=paste(""Select input"",i),
                               choices=choices,
                               selected=choices[1]
                   )
            ),

            &lt;more inputs&gt;
          ),
          fluidRow(
            column(9,
               plotOutput(paste0(""plot"",i))
            )
          ) 
        )
      })
    })
})
</code></pre>

<p>numcharts is a reactive that returns the current number of plotareas to be rendered and dataset is a reactive that returns a particular dataset depending on the inputs. plotValues creates a plot from a dataset.</p>

<p>The ui.R file just renders output$charts.</p>

<p>So... in all the documentation (<a href=""http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/controllers#resource-controllers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/controllers#resource-controllers</a>), you see this:</p>

<pre><code>Route::resource('photo', 'PhotoController');
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I go to the ""Route"" documentation (<a href=""http://laravel.com/api/4.2/Illuminate/Routing/Route.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://laravel.com/api/4.2/Illuminate/Routing/Route.html</a>) you can see that the function ""resource"", doesn't exist there. Instead, it exists under ""Route<strong>r</strong>"" (<a href=""http://laravel.com/api/4.2/Illuminate/Routing/Router.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://laravel.com/api/4.2/Illuminate/Routing/Router.html</a>). </p>

<p>How do I use the PHP ""use"" statements to specify that I'm using the resource function? The example itself is accurate and works when I call (in that it shows all the routes that I expect): </p>

<pre><code>php artisan routes
</code></pre>

<p>How does Laravel make the Route vs. Router namespace work?</p>

The class that contains the data for the ComboBox implements INotifyPropertyChanged Interface and calls the OnPropertyChanged(..) as soon as the Property gets updated. When I leave the ComboBox untouched the changes are correctly propagated. But as soon as the ComboBox is expanded once or a value is selected the changes in the ItemsSource Collection are no longer updated. What may be the reason for this behaviour?</p>

<p>Heres the XAML</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ComboBox Name=""cmbSourceNames"" Grid.Row=""0"" SelectedItem=""{Binding Path=CurrentSource, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}""
  ItemsSource=""{Binding Path=SourceAddresses, NotifyOnSourceUpdated=True}""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The DataContext is set in the code behind:</p>

<pre><code>this.cmbSourceNames.DataContext = this._dpa;
</code></pre>

<p>And this one is the Method that triggers the change of the Property. The Method for adding the Packet is delegated to the Current Dispatcher with BeginInvoke.</p>

<pre><code>    private void DispatcherAddDataPacket(DataPacket dp)
    {
        ObservableCollection&lt;DataPacket&gt; dpList;
        this._dpkts.TryGetValue(dp.SourceAddress, out dpList);

This is what I came with so far:</p>

<pre><code>(defun subl(l)

      (if (= l 10)
          (princ ""Found""))
      (mapcar 'subl l)))

<p>Now the number I am searching for is hard-coded and it is <code>10</code>. I would like to write it somehow so the function takes another parameter(the number I am searching for) and returns <code>true</code> or <code>1</code> when it finds it. The main problem is that I can't see a way to control <code>mapcar</code>. <code>mapcar</code> executes <code>subl</code> on each element of <code>l</code>, if <code>l</code> si a list. But how can I controll the returned values of each call?</p>

<p>I would like to check the return value of each <code>subl</code> call and if one of it is <code>true</code> or <code>1</code> to return <code>true</code> or <code>1</code> till the last recursive call. So in the end <code>subl</code> returns <code>true</code> or <code>one</code> if the element is contained in the list or <code>nil</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>Any idea?</p>

What I'm trying to rewrite is <code>background-position: center calc(100% - 80px);</code></p>

<p>My attempt was somewhat like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(window).resize(function () {
    $('#element').css('background-position', 'center 100%').css('background-position', '-=80px');
});
</code></pre>

<p>but then what do I substract from, the first or the second value? I needed help on that, couldn't think of any possible solution :/</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>To make it more clear, I was trying to have my background image positioned 'center bottom' with 80px y-axis offset, '100%' in this case equals 'bottom'.</p>

<p><strong>ONE MORE EDIT</strong></p>

<p>So finally, I found out.</p>

<p>For this to work, we need to have an <strong>img</strong> element somewhere on the page with <strong>display:none</strong>, containing the background image in original width. Let's give it an ID <strong>#referrer</strong>. We could as well create it with jquery and set the <strong>img</strong>'s <strong>src</strong> to the <strong>element</strong>'s background image, but it's rather complicated, we'd need to get the background image url from the DOM's CSS, so we just create it manually.</p>

<p>like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""our-img.png"" style=""display:none;"" id=""referrer"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>then we can call this function when needed (in my case on window resize)</p>

<pre><code>function larg() {
    foo = $('#element').height() - $('#referrer').height();
    $('#element').css('background-position-y', foo + 'px');
};
</code></pre>

<p>That's how we make the image's bottom aligned with the element's bottom.
Now all we need to do to make an offset is add the numeric value of offset pixels to <strong>foo</strong>.</p>

<p>We can modify our function to take an argument, so we don't have to modify it everytime we change our offset.</p>

<pre><code>function larg(bar) {
    foo = $('#element').height() - $('#referrer').height() + bar;
    $('#element').css('background-position-y', foo + 'px');
};
</code></pre>

<p>Then we can call it basically from anywhere, in <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/85yyz/"" rel=""nofollow"">this fiddle</a>, it's called by buttons <strong>onClick</strong> after resizing the div like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button onClick=""$('#element').css('height', '300px');larg(-80);""&gt;300/-80&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it's not universal and works only if the background image is in original size.</p>

<p><strong>FINAL EDIT</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/85yyz/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">Don't ask me why didn't I know it.</a></p>

<pre><code>background-position: center bottom 80px;
</code></pre>

<p>But I wrote a rather cool piece of code, right?
This line of CSS doesn't work in IE8, therefore the code is useful, though minimally.</p>

In chapter 8, the algorithm for counting sort is given.  It makes sense where you have the input array A and you find the range from 0 to k for the size that array C will be.  C[i] is then made to contain the number of elements in A equal to i.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>A: [2,5,3,0,2,3,0,3]
C: [2,0,2,3,0,1]
</code></pre>

<p>But after this they make it so that C[i] contains the number of elements less than or equal to i.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>C: [2,2,4,7,7,8]
</code></pre>

<p>Why is this necessary?  Couldn't you just iterate through the original C and have a sorted array from that?  You know the exact count of each number so you could just go in order putting the right amount of each number in B and have a sorted array.  Does transforming C from the first form to the second form somehow make it stable?</p>

<p>This is my scenario: I've got a 3rd party unmanaged foo.dll that interacts with an automatic fast payback device, call it FooDevice. I wrote a wrapper around methods of foo.dll, call it FooWrapper, and with marshaling and a bit of hammering I finally make it work; as you may know, when using <code>DllImport</code> all methods exposed need to be marked as <code>static</code> and <code>extern</code>
foo.dll exposes some methods and a callback function pointer; when I try to connect two devices at same time in diffrent threads, my wrapper hangs when tryng to hook this callback function.
I know that static stuff is thread shared, so I thinked about using different <code>AppDomain</code> for each FooWrapper istances.
Do you think is that the right way to do this kind of work?</p>

{
    int value;

public:

};

class MyClass : public MyBaseClass

};

<p>Here's a min-repro, plus proof that both <code>System.Attribute</code> and <code>System.TimeSpan</code> <em>are</em> CLS-compliant:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

[assembly:CLSCompliant(true)]

namespace Test
{
    public class CLSCompliantClass1
    {
        public TimeSpan Foo; // CLS-compliant
        public CLSCompliantClass1(TimeSpan bar) { } // CLS-compliant
    }

    public class CLSCompliantClass2 : Attribute
    {
        public TimeSpan Foo; // CLS-compliant
        public CLSCompliantClass2(double foo) { } // CLS-compliant
    }

    public class NonCLSCompliantClass : Attribute
    {
        // 'Test.NonCLSCompliantClass' has no accessible constructors which use only CLS-compliant types
        public NonCLSCompliantClass(TimeSpan bar) { } // not CLS-compliant??
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To compile run:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;csc /t:library cls.cs /warnaserror /nologo

1. English
2. Italy
3. Simplified Chinese 
4. Traditional Chinese</p>

<p>I have loaded all language strings in the corresponding values folder. But, when i tried to load traditional chinese, i am able to get text of Simplified Chinese only.</p>

<p>After searching in google about this, i tried loading the language based on Locale.</p>

<p>Following is my code of Spinner selection and action</p>

<pre><code>        langSpinner = (Spinner)this.findViewById(R.id.lanuage_spinner1);
        langSpinner.setOnItemSelectedListener(new AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener() 
        {

                else if (pos == 1) 
                {
                    langSelected =""it"";
                    locale = Locale.ITALIAN;
                } 
                else if (pos == 2) 
                {

                else if (pos == 3)
                {
                    langSelected =""zh-rTW"";
                    locale = Locale.TRADITIONAL_CHINESE;
                }

                changeLang(langSelected, pos);
            }

            @Override
            public void onNothingSelected(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; arg0) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub

public void changeLang(String lang, int pos)
    {
        if (lang.length() != 0)
        {
            //locale = new Locale(lang);            
            android.content.res.Configuration config = new android.content.res.Configuration();
            config.locale = locale;
            Locale.setDefault(locale);
            getBaseContext().getResources().updateConfiguration(config, getBaseContext().getResources().getDisplayMetrics());


       // here using intent call the same activity again

        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now my problem is in the next activity i use to show a currency value ""$"", from my back end server i use to get currency code as USD and by parsing it in following code i use to show ""$""</p>

<pre><code>public static Currency parseCurrencyCode(String currencyCode) {
        if (currencyCode.equals(""RMB"")) {
            return Currency.getInstance(""CNY"");
        }
        try {
            return Currency.getInstance(currencyCode);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            Log.e(TAG, ""Unknown Currency "" + currencyCode);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>After adding the above said Locale for loading Traditional Chinese Strings i am not getting the ""$"" value. </p>

<pre><code>If selected language is English, currency will be as USD
If selected language is Italy, currency will be as USD
If selected language is Simplified Chinese, currency will be as US$
If selected language is Traditional Chinese, currency will be as $
</code></pre>

<p>Why this happens ?</p>

<p>I have gone through <a href=""http://speakman.net.nz/blog/2013/10/21/android-currency-localisation-hell/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, saying that due to locale some currency use to appear as explained above. How to overcome this issue.</p>

<p>From the time difference between the exceptions, I conclude that at least two instances of the timer are still active (30 seconds between polls, 4 different times for which groups of 2 are within 30 seconds, the poll interval). However, I cannot simulate the issue by just starting and closing the overview twice.</p>

<p>I suspect a <code>GC</code> related issue where the window object is collected at some point in time, but the poller keeps on existing. When it tries to update the window in the window thread context, it fails. But then, shouldn't the Window object and all it's content only exist in the context of  private void <code>buttonOverview_Click</code>? Added a MessageBox.Show() call to the button method to test if the method is completed after closing the dialog. It does show.</p>

<p>Set a breakpoint on the <code>Poll</code> method to see if it was still called after the dialog was closed. It was, so the poller is definitely living longer then the window is visible. My question is, are my conclusions correct so far? If so, how can the poller continue to exist even though the context wherein the object creating the timer has been instantiated, is no longer existent e.g. how to prevent the poller from living on way past window close? Thinking of an unload event action but do not know if that is the best solution.</p>

<p>And I finish the activity before the alarm rings.</p>

<p>My alarm rings,  my activty is launched and shows a specific fragment (background red) because the extra <code>MainFragmentActivity.IS_LOCKSCREEN</code> is true .</p>

<p>I finish the activity and I run the application with recent app, the extra is always set to true, so the red fragment is launched.
I don't understand, my extra should be set to false.</p>

<p>Styles can be specified:</p>

<pre><code>inside an HTML element
inside the head section of an HTML page
in an external CSS file
</code></pre>

<p>Tip: Even multiple external style sheets can be referenced inside a single HTML document.
Cascading order</p>

<p>What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?</p>

<p>Generally speaking we can say that all the styles will ""cascade"" into a new ""virtual"" style sheet by the following rules, where number four has the highest priority:</p>

<pre><code>Browser default
External style sheet
Internal style sheet (in the head section)
Inline style (inside an HTML element)
</code></pre>

<p>So, an inline style (inside an HTML element) has the highest priority, which means that it will override a style defined inside the head tag, or in an external style sheet, or in a browser (a default value).Reference <a href=""http://w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a>.</p>

<p>But the css here is working just opposite:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
.thumbnail 
{
float:left;
width:110px;
height:90px;
margin:5px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;img class=""thumbnail"" src=""klematis_small.jpg"" width=""107px"" height=""100px""&gt;
&lt;img class=""thumbnail"" src=""klematis2_small.jpg"" width=""107px"" height=""80px""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The width and height of the img are taken from internal style sheet i.e one defined in the head tag</p>

<p>This works and looks good, except for the case that the user is not yet associated with a customer. Then, I get a <code>PG::UndefinedColumn: ERROR:  column construction_sites.customer does not exist</code> error.</p>

<p>This seems to work fine on first sight, but again for the case that the user is not yet associated with a customer <code>current_user.customer_id</code> is <code>nil</code> and <code>ConstructionSite.where(customer_id: nil)</code> gets called which selects all (or all unassigned?) sites, which is not what I want.</p>

<p>I am abit lost when the error is saying that 4 keys differ from 5 when as far as i can tell i am applying 5 values to the dictionary any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Edit** another thing I noticed when debugging my issues was the fact it looks like I am not getting my cacheValue dictionary set up properly as its showing 0 key valuepairs??? is this right or wrong?
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/O1tEn.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>this is what happens when I log my plist in xcode as suggested below when I use <code>[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:..etc</code></p>

The array is below it in the form of 10 empty jTextboxes labeled 0-9. When the user enters a number in the value text box and clicks add the number is put into the textfields below. Once the array is populated I will find the minimum and maximum values.
  I have no problem with the logic behind the sort, the find minimum, find maximum values, but I am having a hard time with the logic behind loading the array, I tried to use a couple of different tactics.</p>

<pre><code>//This is my start of the on_click event for the add button

jTextboxValue.getText();  //I know that this gets me the text from the box
jTextboxvalueArray0.setText();  // I know this is how I set the text in the various boxes

<p>My question is this, what is the most concise way to instantiate and load this array, if it were a console app I would do something like:</p>

int array[] = new int[10];

System.out.println(""Please enter your Values."");

       for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; array.length; i++ ) {

<p>Now when it comes to doing this within a GUI I am stumped, and this has been a recurring source of confusion for me for some time now. I have read the oracle tutorials, a couple java books but nothing has clicked yet.
   How do I transfer my logic from working in the console to working in a GUI?</p>

I would like it to not require the paddress field, but if the paddress field does have a value, it should encode the geocode. As it stands, it always tries to geocode the incoming entry. The commented out ""if paddress_changed?"" was not working and I could not find something like ""if paddress_exists?"" that would work. </p>

<p>Is there a way to extract the RequestBuilder instance used by my RPC service async requestor?</p>

<p>Actually, my question is, how do you extract the RequestBuilder instance to insert the authentication token as a http header? Is there a way to insert http headers into an RPC service request?</p>

<p>Even if I could insert a http header into the request, how then would the remote servlet be told to expect that auth token? Therefore, in fact, does GWT RPC provide a framework for secure authentication at all?</p>

<p>I am thinking the answer is NO, or at least not in a convenient way. Am I right?</p>

<p>I am coming from having used RestEasy in combination with RestyGWT over SSL, where we can insert headers anytime we wish. BTW, RestyGWT constructs its request to use RequestBuilder.</p>

<p>My actual motivation is comparing the security effectiveness between GWT RPC and GWT JAX-RS (RestyGWT + RestEasy). So if you, as the answerer, have an alternative detailed discourse comparing the security effectiveness of RPC with direct use of RequestBuilder or REST (rather than answering this question directly) please feel free to elaborate.</p>

<p>In an OData 4 service on Web API, what is the proper way to call nested $expand from a .NET client?  We are using the <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/9b786c0e-79d1-4a50-89a5-125e57475937"" rel=""nofollow"">OData Client Generator</a>.  Back in the prior WCF Data Services with OData 3 service we could call <code>.Expand(""Customers/Orders"")</code>.  In Web API with OData 4 we can no longer do so and receive the following should you attempt <code>.Expand(""Customers/Orders"")</code>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The query specified in the URI is not valid. Found a path traversing multiple navigation >properties. Please rephrase the query such that each expand path contains only type >segments and navigation properties.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Workaround</h2>

<p>We are able to work around this by calling expand like so: <code>.Expand(""Customers($expand=Orders)"")</code>.  In non-nested $expand scenarios, I like the lambda support like so <code>.Expand(d =&gt; d.Customers)</code>.  Is there a proper way in .NET OData 4 client to call nested expands without the unfortunate magic string of <code>.Expand(""Customers($expand=Orders)"")</code>? If not, is there a cleaner string pattern like ""Customers/Orders"" that would work?  Thanks.</p>

<p>From an initial search it seems that the error pops up because of conflicting dependencies in packaging a jar file that contains code for running the spark job. The python script boxplot_outlier.py does not import any dependency that might cause such a conflict.</p>

<p>In need of some guidance! Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Edit: I checked the Classpath elements of the Oozie Java/Map-Reduce/Pig action launcher-job configuration and it includes the following two jars</p>

<pre><code>/hadoop/yarn/local/usercache/ambari-qa/appcache/application_1441804290161_0903/container_e03_1441804290161_0903_01_000002/mr-framework/hadoop/share/hadoop/common/lib/servlet-api-2.5.jar

</code></pre>

<p>From the discussions in <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-1693"" rel=""nofollow"">SPARK-1693</a> it seems that these two jars may cause this kind of a dependency conflict. The issue though has been stated as resolved in version 1.1.0 itself. There maybe an issue with the dependencies of hadoop 2.7 or there might be some configuration I'm missing. Any help would be appreciated </p>

<p>My link seems to be good because I can connect to my DataBase using the isql command (which is part of unixODBC) and execute some SQL queries but it's impossible to read records in the database using a php script.
When I try to launch a little script on my intranet I get the following error :</p>

<p>Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 493921239296 bytes) in /home/www/imypdo/imypdo.php on line 122</p>

<p>that's more than 450 Gb !! and nothing in /var/log/messages and in /etc/httpd/logs/error_log</p>

<p>A simple sql query (with only 1 row in the select) will return some strange characters (see below) and as soon as I select 1 or 2 more rows the memory size error occurs.</p>

<p>[0] => Array ( [ADHMAR] => AAAAAAA a@YÿŒ4–X 0!ÿŒ4làÿŒ4làÿŒ4! )</p>

<p>I'm almost sure it's a 64bit driver related problem because I already have another Debian linked with this iseries but with the 32 bit driver and it works perfectly.
What is weird is that isql command is working and ther is nothing in the log files...</p>

<p>if it really is a 64 bit driver problem, how can I prove it to IBM ?</p>

<p>any help will be appreciated</p>

The credentials to access said database are stored in a MySQL database on our server. Querying them separately really isn't that hard, (Two letter difference with functions), but I recently had my ""Oh god what a mess"" moment and I'm trying to make things a little tidier.  </p>

<p>In comes OOP. So now I've got basic CRUD classes in separate files for MySQL and SQL Server, but I feel like it's totally not necessary to have two different includes for such similar (Two letters, come on...) functionality.</p>

<p>I tried to add both classes to one file, didn't work.  </p>

<p>So what's the best best practice here?  </p>

I tried simply doing this:</p>

<pre><code>import tkMessageBox
[...stuff...]
if (errorCondition): tkMessageBox.showwarning(""My Module"",""That won't work!"")
</code></pre>

<p>...but when I run it, a root window appears alongside the message box.  I know about the <code>withdraw()</code> method, but since I never imported <code>Tkinter</code> itself and never instantiated <code>Tkinter.Tk()</code>, there's no object for me to use <code>withdraw()</code> on.</p>

<p>An alternative that works is to go ahead and import <code>Tkinter</code> anyway, so I can create the root window myself and then <code>withdraw()</code> it:</p>

<pre><code>import Tkinter
import tkMessageBox
root = Tkinter.Tk()
root.withdraw()
[...stuff...]
if (errorCondition): tkMessageBox.showwarning(""My Module"",""That won't work!"")
</code></pre>

<p>...but even though that works, it seems klunky to bring in a module and instantiate an object just so I can get rid of it.  Plus I don't want to confuse things between this root, and the ""real"" root in the calling applications.</p>

<p>Going back to the first example, it's obvious that <code>tkMessageBox</code> is doing something under the hood to create the root window on its own.  Is there any way I can grab a reference to that root window so I can <code>withdraw()</code> it?</p>

After his merge all changes made by other people (1 through 5 and others) are no longer present at X, B, C, etc...  </p>

<pre><code>A------------
              \

</code></pre>

<p>If I diff commit X to commit A it shows no differences, if I diff commit X to commit 5 it shows all the missing changes. Also, at commit X, B, or C git log does not show changes that were made to files in commits 1 through 5. However, if I do git log --full-history then history does show the changes that were made in 1 through 5, but those changes are not still present in the actual file and history does not show them being being undone. So git log --full-history seems to contradict the current file contents. </p>

<p>I talked to the user who made commit X. He says he did not do a reset or rebase and he says he hasn't reverted any commits during the time in question. However, he says that he does sometimes do a pull origin master that results in everyone else's changes getting put in his index or working tree as if he had made those changes and not the actual authors of those changes. He says when that happens he does a fresh clone and does not push anything from that local repo to master because he believes Git has done something wrong.</p>

<p>Are the two things related (bad pull and bad merge)?</p>

<p>How can I tell exactly what happened so that we can avoid this in the future?</p>

<p>And what causes Git to sometimes put changes pulled from origin master to be placed in the local working directory or index as if they were local changes?</p>

<p>But when I open <code>RelationUC</code> and <code>RelationBase</code> both are showing up correctly.</p>

<p>My program still compiling but why this is bothering me ? Because I have a form <code>EmployeeForm</code> that use a lot of <code>UserControl</code> (like <code>Employee_EmployeeKeyOneRelationUC</code>) and when I try to edit something in this Form, every UserControl included in the form that inherit from <code>UserControleBase</code> are deleted  (left: TFS Server, right: local) :</p>

<p>This diff is showing that the designer deleted all my <code>ucEmployee*</code> object. Just because I change a ComboBox's name (combobox has no relation with one of the UC).</p>

<p>I have notice that when I create a new UserControl file the default code showing up has an error :

<p>But the <code>Using System.Windows.Forms;</code> is right there. If I change the <code>UserControl</code> for <code>System.Windows.Forms.UserControl</code> it works.</p>

I want to store my connection strings in Azure config instead of in the web.config so I can change them without redeploy.  I had thought about loading from settings and adding to the ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings collection but that is readonly.  There are reflection hacks to overcome this, but that doesn't seem like the right way to go.  I also was thinking about deriving from the provider classes to create my own provider classes that can set the connection string, but I don't see a property to set to override the connection string.

The routing works, and the HTML is loaded, but the stylesheet doesn't seem to be. Neither does it work when I <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> the stylesheet directly in the file (and supposedly it's possible to link a stylesheet within the body, with the attribude <code>itemprop</code>

<p>Well, an interesting design choice is that, most predefined block use Delegates to allow us to implement processing logic. That looks good in simple scenarios. But let's think about real world big applications, which requires modularity and encapsulation. I found it hard and unnatural to write well structured app with the DELEGATE approach.</p>

<p>For example, if what I want is just a <code>MultiplyIntByTwoTransformBlock</code> and a <code>NoOpActionBlock</code> as a reusable class TYPE (not an instance). How do I achieve it? I wish I can inherit from <code>TransformBlock</code>/<code>ActionBlock</code> and say, override some <code>Process()</code> method to achieve this. But predefined blocks are sealed. They only accept delegates.</p>

<p>I know I can create a custom block from scratch but obviously it is too complex for me because what I need is just a little customization on top of the predefined ones.</p>

<p>So, how do I achieve my goal? </p>

<p>UPDATE: 
I am not saying there are things delegates cannot do. I am saying exposing abstract blocks in template method pattern is better in many scenarios. Say, I wish I can write a AbstractMultiplyBlock and MultiplyByTwoBlock and MultiplyByThreeBlock, taking advantage of polymorphism. Delegates, unfortunately does not provide such kind of data&amp;logic reusability. </p>

I'm using the entity framework for the persistence model and this accomplishes the independence requirement with the ability of changing entities in memory and then commiting the changes when they are sure their changes are correct.</p>

<p>There is currently an entity that given a set of property values, should be unique and shared by other entities. As an example see below:</p>

<pre><code>class Car
{
    private string name;
    private Engine engine;
}

class Engine
{
    private int cylinderCount;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I want to create a <code>Car</code> with a v6 <code>Engine</code>, I can do so and run my tests but when I'm commiting these changes, the system has to check whether or not some other user has already inserted such <code>Engine</code>. If so, I shouldn't be inserting my own version of <code>Engine</code> and should use that one instead.</p>

<p>There are different ways I can think of to handle this. I know there is a optimistic concurrency control option in the Entity Framework but I don't know if that would give me the entity that caused the duplication and it is not really clear to me how I should use it or whether or not there are better options available.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

When I run the following command:</p>

<p><br></p>

<pre><code>awk '/Info:AgentSession/ {flag=1;next} /\[2015-/{flag=0} flag {print}' test.log
</code></pre>

<p><br>
I get the following output:</p>

But I would like this output, to INCLUDE the <strong>START</strong> string of ""<code>Info:AgentSession</code>"", so to actually end up looking like this (Omitting all other sections of the log that do not referece the <strong>START</strong> string, using the beginning of the <strong>DATE</strong> string ""<strong>[2015-</strong>"" as the <strong>END</strong> string):</p>

Is this possible to do with a simple AWK or SED command?

<p>The problem:
I need to render a report to both an html page embedded in an iframe (so it needs its own url) and to pdf.
The report includes an out of the ordinary graph which is not supported by any graph api I've seen.
My site uses the Joomla! CMS (V. 2.5.*) which means my backend is php and mysql.
I need the report to render without interference from the default template set on Joomla.
I'm running on a linux host, (basic LAMP).
Joomla uses the base tag in their html which screws up svg's url().</p>

<li>Read a .txt file (in real life a log)</li>
<li>a regex cleans and store in memory variables some info </li>
<li>while reading line by line it inserts into a Oracle table</li>
<li>Exit and disconnect when finish gracefully.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Table has 8 columns and one of this store date and time of an event and the format that i declared into sql is:</p>

<pre><code>DATETIME_EVENT VARCHAR2(255 BYTE) DEFAULT NULL NOT NULL 
</code></pre>

<p>you can clearly see where i am going in a bit....</p>

<p>so point 3 above execute this block:</p>

<pre><code>my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare('INSERT INTO myTable(TIME_ISSUE,col2,col3,col4,col5,col6,col7,col8) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)');
</code></pre>

<p>EXAMPLE INSERTED IS: 2014-09-19 00:03:58,562 </p>

<p>Everything is smooth and fine , however I will perform set of queries later on; but I  will have to translate with to_date function in SQL to interpret  TIME_ISSUE column as datetime TYPE.</p>

<p>AS: </p>

<pre><code>select to_date(SUBSTR(TIME_ISSUE,0,19) ,'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS' ) from myTable;
</code></pre>

<p>OUTPUT: 19/09/2014 23:59:56</p>

<p>If I create the table.column as datetime type how can i write the perl insert block above in order to insert a txt into datetime type?</p>

<p>I tried but is not working at all:</p>

<pre><code>my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare('INSERT INTO REQUEST (TO_DATE(SUBSTR(DATETIME_EVENT ,0,19), 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'),LOG_LEVEL,LOGONID, CLIENTID, USERID,IPADDRESS,DURATION,CLASSMETHOD) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)')
</code></pre>

<p>p.s.</p>

<p>you can assume that if i run the perl above i have previously created that column as this:</p>

<p>Lets say that I've created a view that combines a few attributes from a few tables. </p>

<p>My question, what do I need to do so I can query against this view as if it were a table without worrying about performance? </p>

<p>All attributes in the original tables are indexed, my concern is that the result view will have hundreds of thousands of records, which I will want to narrow down quite a bit based on user input.</p>

<p>What I'd like to avoid, is having multiple versions of the code that generates this view floating around with a few extra ""where"" conditions to facilitate the user input filtering.</p>

<p>For example, assume my view has this header <code>VIEW(Name, Type, DateEntered)</code> this may have 100,000+ rows (possibly millions). I'd like to be able to make this view in SQL Server, and then in my application write querlies like this:</p>

<p><code>SELECT Name, Type, DateEntered FROM MyView WHERE DateEntered BETWEEN @date1 and @date2;</code></p>

<p>Basically, I am denormalizing my data for a series of reports that need to be run, and I'd like to centralize where I pull the data from, maybe I'm not looking at this problem from the right angle though, so I'm open to alternative ways to attack this.</p>

An example would be:</p>

<pre><code>def Transfunc(df, arg1, arg2, arg2):
     return something

GroupedData.transform(Transfunc, arg1, arg2, arg3)
</code></pre>

<p>Where the df argument is passed automatically as the first argument.</p>

<p>However, the same syntax does not seem to be possible when using a function to group the data. Take the following example: </p>

<pre><code>people = DataFrame(np.random.randn(5, 5), columns=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'], index=['Joe', 'Steve', 'Wes', 'Jim', 'Travis'])
people.ix[2:3, ['b', 'c']] = NA

def MeanPosition(Ind, df, Column):
    if df[Column][Ind] &gt;= np.mean(df[Column]):
        return 'Greater Group'
    else:
        return 'Lesser Group'
# This function compares each data point in column 'a' to the mean of column 'a' and return a group name based on whether it is greater than or less than the mean

people.groupby(lambda x: MeanPosition(x, people, 'a')).mean()
</code></pre>

<p>The above works just fine, but I can't understand why I have to wrap the function in a lambda. Based upon the syntax used with transform and apply it seems to me that the following should work just fine:</p>

<pre><code>people.groupby(MeanPosition, people, 'a').mean()
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone tell me why, or how I can call the function without wrapping it in a lambda?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>EDIT: I do not think it is possible to group the data by passing a function as the key without wrapping that function in a lambda. One possible workaround is to rather than passing a function as the key, pass an array that has been created by a function. This would work in the following manner:</p>

<pre><code>def MeanPositionList(df, Column):
    return ['Greater Group' if df[Column][row] &gt;= np.mean(df[Column]) else 'Lesser Group' for row in df.index]

Grouped = people.groupby(np.array(MeanPositionList(people, 'a')))
Grouped.mean()
</code></pre>

<p>But then of course it could be better just to cut out the middle man function all together and simply use an array with list comprhension....</p>

<p>On the other hand - the correlating log entry in windows event log shows no stack at all. Our application uses unmanaged libraries as well and my guess would've been that the exception is caused by misusing them (for example oci) rather than the managed stack shown.</p>

For instance, if event 1 is checked then store a 1, and if not then store a 0.  I understand that this requires the use of a foreach loop, or something similar, but I can't seem to figure out how to implement it.</p></li>
<li><p>When I get to the point where I either have to edit the information or just approve the information prior to allowing it to be viewed on the website, I now need to be able to 're-check' the box on the form based upon how it was originally set by the customer.  Again, I have a basic understanding of how to do this, but...</p></li>

<p>Somewhere out there in the ether there must exist a site that can help me understand how to accomplish these tasks.  If you know of one, please let know the URL so I can learn and accomplish my goal.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help,</p>

We have taken an external library this app needs and created a library module in the project, and this library has an AspectJ <strong>.aj</strong> file that we need to compile and have work with the main app for a field-level Observable pattern.  Using the plugin found <a href=""https://github.com/uPhyca/gradle-android-aspectj-plugin"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""here"">here</a>, I have been able to get the <strong>.aj</strong> file to compile into a <strong>.class</strong> file, verified by looking in the <code>intermediates</code> folder.</p>

<p>The problem is coming in the 'weaving' step, where this code is supposed to be injected into the bytecode of the necessary classes.  This does not appear to be happening, as the listeners that are supposed to be notified when a field changes, aren't.  Below are my build files.</p>

<p>I found OSKit and its liboskit_exec, but project seems to be dead since 2002.</p>

<p>I'm OK with taking parts of projects (respecting licenses, of course) and tailoring them to my need, but as I'm quite a noob in the linux world, I dont even know where to find those parts! :)</p>

<p>PS. I need that for ARM platform.</p>

<p><strong>UPD</strong> Well, the matter of loading elfs seems to require some good knowledge about it (sigh), so I'm out to read some specs and manuals. And I think I will stick to bionic/linker and libelfsh. Thanks guys! </p>

<p>From the manufacturer, I have received an instrument.dll and an instrument.tlb. Unfortunately, details and code are subject to a confidentiality agreement, so I can only provide pseudocode.</p>

<p>I have two minimal examples, one on Free Pascal (the important one, because this is where I am developing):</p>

<pre><code>uses
   Instrument_TLB; // Imported via the Lazarus ""Import Type Library"" function from the .tlb or the .dll

[...]

procedure TForm1.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  AInstrument := CoInstrument.Create;
  if AInstrument.Connected then ...
end;

<p>and one on Visual Basic, provided by the manufacturer:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Form_Load()
   Set theInstrument = New Instrument
   If theInstrument.Connected Then ...
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>This VB6 project has the instrument.dll as a reference.</p>

<p>The behaviour on different computers is as follows (supplemented with information from Sysinternals Process Explorer):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>System A (Windows XP, 32bit, used for compilation): Both the FP and the VB executable work as expected, a connection can be established. In Process Explorer, both executables have one thread with instrument.dll and the TCP/IP connection can be seen to be up.</p></li>
<li><p>System B (Windows 7, 64bit): Both the FP and the VB executable work as expected, a connection can be established. Process Explorer was not used.</p></li>
<li><p>System C (Windows 7, 64bit): The VB executable works as expected, a connection can be established. In Process Explorer the VB executable has one thread with instrument.dll and the TCP/IP connection can be seen to be up. The FP executable can NOT connect, there are <strong>two</strong> threads with instrument.dll and <strong>no</strong> TCP/IP connection seen in Process Explorer.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know that based on the little information I am able to give, no one can come up with a ""solution"" - however, advice on how to investigate this problem further, what tools to use for debugging would be highly appreciated!</p>

<p>I have inquiries and other important mail sent to a shared email address. All 4 team meambers have full access to this email.  I'm using a googlemail to manage that email address. </p>

<p>There's a huge load of emails coming to that inbox: inquiries, orders, requests... The team has to deal with messages, reply and take actions accordingly. However the problem is... ok while I can use IMAP to let each member have their email clients synchronized (Android, Apple Mail, Thunderbird...), how to alert other members in the group? Specifically, how to make aware the rest of the team members when one of the team members has answered to a message? And also, even if one of the members does not answers... but only reads an incoming new message, the message will be marked as read and other members could not notice it. </p>

<p>So the question is... how to synchronize teamwork in a way everyone is informed of other people actions in regards of receiving/sending email? This could work with CC/BCC but I do not really wish to do that, seems more confusing. </p>

<p>Are there any solutions (possibly free/open) for this situation? I'd wish to use googlemail as email provider in any case and people should be able to check everything both from web, desktop clients and mobile clients. Perhaps this could be addressed with a ticket system... Any advices?</p>

<p>thanks!</p>

I gone through some other questions on stack Overflow also some articles related to How to avoid ConcurrentModificationException. I come to know that this exception occurs while looping on collection AND modifying the same (most common issue with <code>remove</code>).</p>

<p>But in my case I am just looping (<code>foreach</code>) on an <code>java.util.Set</code> then am I m getting this exception.</p>

<p>Moreover I am not getting this exception always, When I do load testing of my web application using <code>Jmeter</code> (150 users in 5 seconds) in this scenario I m getting exception</p>

<p>Here is my code where I am getting exception according to stack trace from log file</p>

<pre><code>public static Map&lt;String, String&gt; getMessageMap(Locale locale) {
    Properties properties;
    Set&lt;Object&gt; objkeys;
    Map&lt;String, String&gt; messageMap = null;

    if (messageMap == null) {
        messageMap = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();
        // 1 Get properties file.
        properties = Utility.loadPropertiesFile(locale); // this method return properties from static veriable

        // 2 Get all keys of properties file.
        objkeys = properties.keySet();

        // 3 Add all key values into map.
        for (Object key : objkeys) { caught exception here
            String keyName = key.toString();

        }

    }

<p>At creation time I'm able to fill the grids and figures with my data content, but I'm not able to updated the figure content after a change event such as when new data are pasted into the grid.

<p>Any ideas how to fix this? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I tried to make the field not static and I also tried adding the PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer. My applicationContext looks like </p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;beans xmlns=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans""
       xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""
       xsi:schemaLocation=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd""&gt;

        &lt;bean id=""properties"" class=""org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer""&gt;
            &lt;property name=""locations""&gt;
                &lt;list&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;classpath:config/application.properties&lt;/value&gt;
                &lt;/list&gt;
            &lt;/property&gt;
        &lt;/bean&gt;
    &lt;/beans&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I run this code I get the same stack trace. Null is still printed. I created a seperate class that has a non static field and simply has a method that prints that field. My main class then creates an instance of that dummy class and calls the print field method. At which point null is printed.</p>

<p>In my applicationContext file I get an error on line 7 when I try to say class =""org.spring...""</p>

<p>It says class or interface excepted. As though it is not finding the class. However I have included the following dependencies in by build.gralde</p>

<pre><code>    compile ""org.springframework:spring-context""
compile ""org.springframework:spring-context-support""
</code></pre>

<p>My code compiles and runs fine the problem is the field is null despite the stack trace saying that application.properites was found and loaded.</p>

<pre><code>ApplicationContext applicationContext = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(""applicationContext.xml"");
@Value(""#{app_properties['tenant.cache.refresh']}"")
private Integer cacheRefreshTime;

I've got the problem that I want to redirect my HTTP requests to a HTTPS using a shared SSL certificate. For some stupid reason of my host I have to attach the SSL Port on the request url.
Basically I want to redirect this:</p>

<pre><code>http://sub.domain.com
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>https://sub.domain.com:12345
</code></pre>

<p>my .htaccess looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} =off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}:12345%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R]
</code></pre>

<p>By this results in a redirect loop. I have no idea why though. Is this maybe because I use a shared SSL certificate which is not made for the domain and therefore the RewriteCond is always off?</p>

<p>thanks in advance!</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I've checked the response header and saw that the location field still points to the non https url. But if I use another domain (or even a subdomain) it works. So why doesn't work the redirect to the same domain?</p>

The XML file i am using for this configuration was generated by the <code>SonataEasyExtendsBundle</code> in:
<code>Application\Sonata\UserBundle\Resources\config\serializer\Entity.User.xml</code> and looks like this:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;

    This file has been generated by the EasyExtends bundle 
    ( http://sonata-project.org/bundles/easy-extends )

        &lt;property name=""id"" type=""integer"" expose=""true"" since-version=""1.0"" groups=""sonata_api_read,sonata_api_write,sonata_search"" /&gt;
    &lt;/class&gt;
&lt;/serializer&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I also configured <code>app/config/config.yml</code> to use that XML file:</p>

<pre><code>jms_serializer:
    metadata:
        auto_detection: true
        directories:
            ApplicationSonatUserBundle:
                path: @ApplicationSonataUserBundle/Resources/config/serializer
                namespace_prefix: Application\Sonata\UserBundle\Model
</code></pre>

<p>Now according to the configuration i should only see the id field when the object gets serialized. But when i test this all fields are exposed. This is obviously a bad idea.
I am using <code>FOSRestBundle</code> to implement the API layer where this is being used. And if i run:</p>

<pre><code>get_class($this-&gt;getUser())
//outputs Application\Sonata\UserBundle\Entity\User
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>FOSUserBundle</code> is using the right <code>User</code> entity. </p>

So far everything is working well except when I reboot my Debian 7.8 server.  When that happens, my Celery workers won't restart because when the server reboots, it changes ownership of the celery log files from my ""celery"" user to ""root"".  Also, the system deletes my /run/celery directory where I write my pid files.  If I make these changes by hand and restart Celery, all my workers start normally.</p>

<p>Since these changes need to occur before starting the workers, I thought the solution would be to write a shell script which, due to its higher priority, gets executed from my supervisor.conf script before the celery worker commands (See below).</p>

<p>However, this setup script won't run.  My supervisor log just says,</p>

<pre><code>exited: celery-setup (exit status 0; not expected)
gave up: celery-setup entered FATAL state, too many start retries too quickly.
</code></pre>

<p>Also, no errors get written to the stdout/err logfiles.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this the right approach to take to change my worker log permissions and recreate the pid directories before the celery workers are restarted?</p></li>
<li><p>If this is the right approach, why isn't it working?  If it's not, what's the right approach?</p></li>
<li><p>If I were using an init.d celeryd daemon script instead of Supervisor, there's a <a href=""http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/tutorials/daemonizing.html#example-configuration"" rel=""nofollow"">CELERY_CREATE_DIRS</a> setting that will automatically create pid and log directories that are owned by the user/group.  Is there a way to replicate this setting when using supervisord?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>On the one hand, I know Supervisor should only be used on foreground process, which is not the case with this script.  On the other hand, I've seen other questions here which seem to imply that you should be able to run a shell script from Supervisor.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>it works but after completed the ad it stops no video from live display but audio sometimes .</p>

<p>If I restart the output link then video of live stream is fine. My senior says you have to handle the timestamps of rtmp packets but i am unable to do it . I do something like this in <code>RTMP_write()</code> method and I give a name streamer to that method.</p>

<pre><code> if (pkt-&gt;m_nBytesRead == pkt-&gt;m_nBodySize)
    {
     if(live&lt;=0)
      {
       if(pkt-&gt;m_nTimeStamp &gt; 0)
         {
          pkt-&gt;m_nTimeStamp=ts_cl+numy[rand() % (sizeof(numy) / sizeof(numy[0]))];
          ts_cl=pkt-&gt;m_nTimeStamp;
         }
          if(r==NULL)
              return -1;
          cout&lt;&lt;""Pre_roll streaming""&lt;&lt;endl;
          cout&lt;&lt;""packet adver timestamp when both equal is:""&lt;&lt;ts_cl&lt;&lt;endl;
          ret = RTMP_SendPacket(r, pkt, FALSE);
          RTMPPacket_Free(pkt);
          pkt-&gt;m_nBytesRead = 0;
          if (!ret)
              return -1;
     }

<p>here live &lt;=0 is for ad section below it if live=1 then live section start same as above. after try this, stream not stop but on terminal errors are shown`Cannot use next picture in error concealment</p>

The idea is to get increased test coverage by making sure that all public methods of each are tested by at least 1 unit test.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: I'm having trouble detecting if a method from a class has been called. I've tried using the debug_backtrace() function, but it only returns calls from the test framework, not the class method being tested. The only way I can get the method name being run is to actually place the debug_backtrace() function into the method of the tested class, which is an unacceptable option because I would have to have it in every public method of every class.</p>

<p>Is there an alternate way of doing the backtrace to get the tested class method? Or, in a slightly different approach, is there a way to start and stop a listener that will record all methods that are being called (I can parse out anything that doesn't belong)?</p>

<p>""Administrators can also initiate a major compaction through nodetool compact, which merges all SSTables into one. Though major compaction can free disk space used by accumulated SSTables, during runtime it temporarily doubles disk space usage and is I/O and CPU intensive. Also, once you run a major compaction, automatic minor compactions are no longer triggered frequently forcing you to manually run major compactions on a routine basis. So while read performance will be good immediately following a major compaction, it will continually degrade until the next major compaction is manually invoked. For this reason, major compaction is NOT recommended by DataStax."" (<a href=""http://www.datastax.com/docs/1.0/operations/tuning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datastax.com/docs/1.0/operations/tuning</a>)</p>

<p>The two questions after reading this that came to my mind that I am trying to understand better are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why would the major compaction that is triggered manually change the minor compaction interval / frequency? I am not quite sure I follow the underlying reason behind this.</li>
<li>If I do need to run major compaction manually using nodetool, is it even possible and if so how can I revert back to ensure that the minor compaction intervals do not get affected as a result and are reset to the default behavior.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a solution where I just make it with string and convert to XML object, but how can I do it with XElement class?</p>

<p>This is the document:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
 &lt;requestblock version=""3.67""&gt;
    &lt;alias&gt;ALIAS&lt;/alias&gt;
    &lt;request type=""AUTH""&gt;

          &lt;sitereference&gt;test12345&lt;/sitereference&gt; 
          &lt;accounttypedescription&gt;TEST&lt;/accounttypedescription&gt; 
          &lt;parenttransactionreference&gt;12-3-4567&lt;/parenttransactionreference&gt; 
       &lt;/operation&gt; 
       &lt;merchant&gt; 
          &lt;orderreference&gt;Example recurring auth&lt;/orderreference&gt;
       &lt;/merchant&gt; 
       &lt;customer&gt; &lt;/customer&gt; 
       &lt;billing&gt; 
          &lt;amount currencycode=""GBP""&gt;1234&lt;/amount&gt; 
          &lt;subscription type=""TEST""&gt;
             &lt;number&gt;1&lt;/number&gt;
          &lt;/subscription&gt; 
       &lt;/billing&gt; 
       &lt;settlement/&gt;
    &lt;/request&gt; 
 &lt;/requestblock&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I already have a part of the code like this:</p>

<pre><code>       XElement address =
            new XElement(""alias"", ""TEST"",
            new XElement(""request"", new XAttribute(""type"", ""AUTH""),
            new XElement(""City"", ""Mercer Island""),
            new XElement(""State"", ""WA""),
            new XElement(""Postal"", ""68042"")
       ));
</code></pre>

<p>But I have a problem with alias, because alias is closed after all elements, not in the same notation:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;alias&gt;TEST
    &lt;request type=""AUTH""&gt;
        &lt;City&gt;Mercer Island&lt;/City&gt;
        &lt;State&gt;WA&lt;/State&gt;
        &lt;Postal&gt;68042&lt;/Postal&gt;
    &lt;/request&gt;
&lt;/alias&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see  notation is the problem.</p>

<p>It says, there are also other forms of switch statement besides general switch statement (with case keyword).
The general form of switch statement is</p>

<pre><code>switch (exp)
{
 case constant-exp:
  statement;
  break;
 case constant-exp:
  statement;
  break;
 ...
 ...
 default:
  statement;
  break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It also says (in Q&amp;A) switch statement can have form with no case keyword for example.
I tried running an example with no case keyword, but it doesn't run (under std=-c99).</p>

<p>So, I wanted to know what are the other forms of switch statement that are valid in Standard C99.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Cited fro BOOK</strong></p>

<p>In it's most common form, the switch statement has the form</p>

<pre><code>switch ( expression ) {
case constant-expression : statements
...
case constant-expression : statements
default : statements
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong></p>

<p>**Q: The template given for the switch statement described it as the ""most common form."" Are there other forms?</p>

<p>A**: The switch statement is a bit more general than described in this chapter, although the description given here is general enough for virtually all programs.
For example, a <strong>switch statement can contain labels that aren't preceded by the word case</strong>, which leads to amusing (?) trap. Suppose that we accidentally missell the word default:</p>

<pre><code>switch(...) {
...
defualt:  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler may not detect the error, since it assumes that <em>defualt</em> is an ordinary label.</p>

<p>Basically, I am trying to get a truck to animate from the left hand side of the screen to the right, then when it gets to the right of the screen, the background image of the truck swaps to an image of the truck facing the other way, and it then animates back across the screen, and will repeat for ever.</p>

<p>I can get the truck to move across the screen, and swap the background image, but cannot get everything to happen in some sort of logical order - I.E. the truck background image is swapped on page-load and not when the left to right has completed.</p>

<p>Here is the code so far, and I realize that the syntax is probably wrong, but hopefully you will see what I am trying to do:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

    $("".animationWrap"").animate({ left: ""845px"" }, { duration: 9000, queue: true }){
	$("".animationWrap"").css('background', 'transparent url(/Resources/Images/clearence/truckLeft.png) no-repeat 0 0');
}

});

It's running in a separate Linux machine on a different domain, and I am trying to access the REST data from my Windows machine, using jQuery $.ajax.</p>

<p>When I type in the URL in browser, it prompts me for a user-name password, as expected. On providing correct est of values, I could see the JSON output.</p>

<p>But when I try to do so by jQuery Ajax function, I keep getting the following error:</p>

<p><code>Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :</code></p>

<p>My server URL looks like this:</p>

<p><code>http://my.server.com:port/application/rest/1.0/Books</code></p>

<p>If I type that in a browser, I get the following text output in white background:</p>

<p><code>{

<p><code>$(document).ready(function() {
                      $.ajax({
                      url: ""http://my.server.com:port/application/rest/1.0/Books"",<br>

    });</code></p>

<p>Outside the jQuery AJAX, <code>myMethod</code> is defined as:</p>

<p><code>window.myMethod = function(data) {
   return data;
}</code></p>

<p>The error method in jQuery AJAX is telling me that the <code>jsonpCallback</code> is not being called.</p>

<p>I found similar errors on stackoverflow, but none of the suggestions made it go away.</p>

<p>I use Chrome Inspector tools - there, the request is loading the JSON data as expected, but in the first line, where the <code>items</code> array is starting, the colon is probably not being accepted. It's expecting start of a callback, as I understood from other threads here. But no matter what I do, I cannot receive the <code>callback({JSON})</code> format.</p>

<p>Please help. And yes, I have access to the server, and I tested the rest data with REST client extensions in both Chrome and Mozilla. The proper JSON object array is being returned.</p>

<p>After pressing the <code>Submit Button</code>, how is the <code>Class</code> in the <code>Controller</code> - including the function called <code>TheRequest</code> - <em>invoked</em>?</p>

<p>In this case, I am directing the question to the process, of having the <code>Controller</code> scanned for the <em>Class</em> and the <em>Functions</em>, - <strong><em>after</em></strong> - the <em>submit button</em> is pressed, so that the <code>request</code> can be done correctly to the <code>HTTP POST method</code>.</p>

<hr />

<p>The given is the <code>current HTTP request</code>, after pressing the <code>Submit Button</code>. Where the <code>Request.Form</code> method does do the request specifically for the ""ColorName"", submitted through the form.</p>

<p>By my PHP experience, I am thinking of having the <strong><em>""action attribute of the form""</em></strong> contain the name of the controller, so it can start scanning each line, after the <em>submit button</em> is pressed. This is said as an example.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/buPqe.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/buPqe.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>i want different images in each of the block each time the page refreshes the images changes in each block
like image1 in block 1 and image2 in block 2 and so on i can not use loop as the divs here are not the same i have this particular pattern</p>

<p>i can get the images from my database and stored in an array but i have no idea how to place them in these divs individual to be distinct from each other </p>

<p>see my code below </p>

<pre><code>   $getimages=mysqli_query($conn,""select uid,vname,thumb,views from 
   tablename where something !='0' and somethingelse !='' order by rand()   limit 21"");
   $Results = array();
   while($tmp=mysqli_fetch_assoc($getimages)){
   $Results[] = array('uid' =&gt; $tmp['uid'], 
   'vname' =&gt; $tmp['vname'], 'thumb' =&gt; $tmp['thumb']);
     }
    $i=randim('13');
     function randim($code){
    return rand(0,10);
     }
</code></pre>

<p>please give me some hints to solve this i want individual images in each of the block i can not use loop as the divs are non repetative </p>

<p>in my div i am calling images as</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;div class=""somethingddd"" style=""background:url('mem/&lt;?=$Results[$i]['uid']?&gt;/img/&lt;?=$Results[$i]['thumb']?&gt;');background-size:cover;""&gt;

<p>Is there any way for me to host a file (or folder) on someone else's domain (with their permission, of course)? For example, if their site is hosted at <code>www.example.com</code>, I would like to host a file at <code>www.example.com/foo.html</code>, or a folder at <code>www.example.com/foo/</code>, or the like. I just need to be able to make changes at will to a single file.</p>

<p>We can't use a redirect or anything like that - the purpose of this is to allow me to control a document loaded in an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> on their site, and for the JavaScript in that <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> to have access (i.e., no security restrictions) to its <code>parent</code> page - which is only allowed if the domains match. Their site doesn't change the <code>document.domain</code> property to relax the security restrictions, nor can we ask them to start using that approach (it's an enormous site).</p>

<p>I also can't generate an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> and create its document solely using JavaScript - we've done that in the past, and it gets around the security restrictions (the generated <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> is in the same domain as its parent page), but it causes other issues and difficulties that add up to a deal-breaker in this case.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any alternative suggestions, or if you need any more information about what exactly I'm trying to do.</p>

I'm getting packets using netfilter hooks. All filtering is done inside hook function, but I don't want to do packet processing here. So solution is tasklets or workqueues. I know the difference between them, I can use both, but I have some problems and I need an advice.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Tasklets solution. Preferrable. I can create and start tasklet for
each packet, but who will delete this tasklet? Tasklet function? I
don't think its a good idea - to dealloc tasklet while it is
executing. Create global pool of tasklets? Well, since there can't
be 2 executing tasklets on one processor, the pool size will be the
number of processors. But how to find out when tasklet is available
for new use? There are only two states: shed and run, but there is
no ""done"" state. Ok, I probably can wrap tasklet with some struct
with flag. But wouldn't that  all be too much overkill?</p></li>
<li><p>Workqueue solution. Same problem: who will delete work? Same ""solution"" as for tasklets?</p></li>
<li><p>Workqueue solution 2. Just create permanent work due module loading, save packets to some queue and process them inside the work. May be two works and two queues: incoming and outgoing. But I'm afraid that with that solution I will use only one (or two) processors since looks like work can't be performed on few processors simultaneously.</p></li>

<p>my code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;script&gt;
$(window).load(function() {

    $('#rounded-corner #mtg_card').click(function()
        {
            $(this).find("".mtg_shop_cart"").attr(""src"",""image1"");
            window.setTimeout(function() {
              $(this).find("".mtg_shop_cart"").attr(""src"",""image2"");
            }, 1000);
            return false;
        });
});

&lt;/script&gt;

<p>From what I've learned so far, you cannot use a css attribute selector with click_link as it only looks for specific text or dom ID. Instead I'm trying to use the webrat <code>within</code> method, but once I select the link how do I click it? I figured <code>link.click</code> within the link's scope would work, but it fails saying the method <code>click</code> is undefined:</p>

<p>However, when I run <code>rake routes</code> I get the following output:</p>

<pre><code>request_caches    GET    /request_caches(.:format)            request_caches#index
                  POST   /request_caches(.:format)            request_caches#create

<p>As you can see, Rails somehow maps <code>request_caches</code> plural to <code>request_cach</code> singular. But it should be <code>request_cache</code>. Is this some kind of special case, because of the word <code>caches</code>? I've also played around with</p>

<pre><code>resources :request_caches, as: :request_cache
</code></pre>

<p>But this results in wrong routes like <code>request_cache_index</code>. And furthermore, I think this is a standard task and should be solved clearly using Rails intern route helpers.</p>

<p>So, what am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>For the navigation part I'm building an Activity where the user can move and zoom the map (which is a bitmap) using touch events, and also the map rotate around the center of the screen using the compass.</p>

<p>I'm using Matrix to scale, transpose and rotate the image, and than I draw it to the canvas.</p>

<p>Here is the code called on loading of the view, to center the image in the screen:</p>

<pre><code>    image = new Matrix();
    image.setScale(zoom, zoom);

    image_center = new PointF(bmp.getWidth() / 2, bmp.getHeight() / 2);

    float centerScaledWidth = image_center.x * zoom;
    float centerScaledHeigth = image_center.y * zoom;

    image.postTranslate(
            screen_center.x -  centerScaledWidth, 
            screen_center.y - centerScaledHeigth);
</code></pre>

<p>The rotation of the image is doing using the <em>postRotate</em> method.</p>

<p>Then in the <em>onDraw()</em> method I only call</p>

<pre><code>  canvas.drawBitmap(bmp, image, drawPaint);
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that, when the user touch the screen, I want to get the point touched on the image, but apparently I can't get the correct position. 
I tried to invert the <strong>image</strong> matrix and translate the touched points, it isn't working.</p>

<p>Do somebody know how to translate the point coordinates?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I'm using this code for traslation. 
<em>dx</em> and <em>dy</em> are translation values get from the <em>onTouch</em> listener.
*new_center* is an array of float values in this form {x0, y0, x1, y1...}</p>

<pre><code>  Matrix translated = new Matrix();
  Matrix inverted = new Matrix();

  translated.set(image);
  translated.postTranslate(dx, dy);

  translated.invert(inverted);
  inverted.mapPoints(new_center);
  translated.mapPoints(new_center);

  Log.i(""new_center"", new_center[0]+"" ""+new_center[1]);
</code></pre>

<p>Actually I tried using as *new_center = {0,0}*:</p>

<p>appling only the <em>translated</em> matrix, I get as espected the distance between the (0,0) point of the bmp and the (0,0) point of the screen, but it seems to not take account of the rotation.</p>

<p>Appling the <em>inverted</em> matrix to the points I get those results, moving the image in every possible way.</p>

<pre><code>  12-26 13:26:08.481: I/new_center(11537): 1.9073486E-6 -1.4901161E-7

<p>Instead I was especting the coordinates translated on the image.</p>

However, I would like to compare the attributes of the two strings I am comparing.
E.g. string 1 is ""This <em>is</em> <strong>L</strong>ine 1"" and string 2 is ""This <strong>is</strong> <em>L</em>ine 2""
I want to compare if the font attributes like Bold, Italics, font name, font size, etc. are also the same between the two strings. </p>

<p>lets assume that every unique combination of the 4 attributes mentioned above can be codified as F1, F2, etc. I end up with a list of tuples
e.g. String 1 = [(T, F1), (h, F1), (i, F1), (s, F1), ( ,F1), (i,F2), (s,F2),.......]
where F0, F1, F2 are some combination of Bold, Italics, Font name and Font size</p>

<p>Without actually looping through every character in the list, is there a faster way to compare these attributes? Is there another way I can store the attributes that will make comparison easier?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

Generaly this table contains datas from pages on different languages.

The first row means: First page name is 'First Page' at language 1 - whitch is english right now.

I want every page from the page table, and the name at the LOWEST language_id!

So something like this:
1, 1, 1, First page
3, 2, 1, Second Page
4, 3, 2, Third page

<p>I have a query for it:</p>

SELECT *

         language_id ASC

<p>It gives back what I want. But if the table looks like this: </p>

<p>The quickest way I can think of explaining it is to put it in code, using comments to explain how it works. I'll indicate in these comments which is the part that I can't figure out. </p>

<p>I have a text field styled to look non-editable, with an 'edit' button next to it which, when clicked, turns into a 'save' button, and makes the text field look editable.</p>

<pre><code>$("".edit_btn"").click(function() {
   // make the associated text field look editable, and change this 'edit'
   // button into a 'save' button. Then place focus on the text in
   // in the field.
});

$("".save_btn"").click(function() {
   // if (value in associated text field has changed from when page loaded)
   //   submit the form and save this new text
   // else 
   //   revert to non-editable mode (hide this 'save' button, 
   //   and show 'edit' button)
});
</code></pre>

<p>All that works fine. However, if the user leaves the editable text field I want to be able to detect whether they've left the field to click the 'save' button, or just clicked anywhere else on the page. So within the 'blur' event handler for the field, I need to know if I've clicked the 'save button. For the life of me I can't figure out how to do it:</p>

<pre><code>$('input[name^=""tgfld_""]').blur(function() {
    // if (save button has been clicked) &lt;- this is the problem
    //   don't do anything since the save function will handle this
    // else if (value in the field hasn't changed)
    //   revert everything back to non-editable mode
    // else if (value in the field HAS changed)
    //   do a window.confirm and prompt the user to click the 'save' 
    //   button to save their changes
});
</code></pre>

<p>So it's detecting if the save button was the reason for the 'blur' being triggered - that's what I can't figure out.</p>

<p>Or, if this is completely the wrong way of handling the situation, please let me know. </p>

<p>(I should point out that there could be many of these field/button combinations on the page, but so far that isn't affecting anything.)</p>

My only problem is when you move your mouse on the menu or submenu items the first couple of times it will hide and then re-display the image. Then after that nothing happens. I'm not sure why this happening.</p>

<p>I have looked on other questions with no luck. I have checked w3school.com to make sure i was doing everything correctly. I've done some Google searches with no luck either. I used Dreamweaver to set up the page but have use notepad++ to do the rest and after i ran into this error i checked my syntax in Dreamweaver and didn't run into any errors.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated if you would like to see the whole code I cant post a link to the website.</p>

<p>To summarize my question. I have a page with a menu that when the menu item or submenu item is clicked it will hide the instructions picture and when you remove your mouse it will re-display it. My problem is it only works a couple of times and then you have to reload the page for it to work again.</p>

From what I understood (and please, correct me if I'm wrong), the main difference between categories and extensions is that the extension expects you to implement the methods inside your main implementation, whereas with a category, it can be in another implementation. It also seems that people are using extensions mainly for private methods.</p>

<p>Here's my first question. What's the difference between using a class extension to declare a private method, and not declare it at all (it seems to compile in run in both cases)? (example 1 vs 2)</p>

<p>Example 1</p>

<pre><code>@interface Class()
-(void) bar;
@end

@implementation Class
-(void) foo {
    [self bar];
}

-(void) bar {
    NSLog(@""bar"");
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>Example 2</p>

<pre><code>@implementation Class
-(void) foo {
    [self bar];
}

-(void) bar {
    NSLog(@""bar"");
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>Second question: What's the difference between declaring ivars inside the extension and declaring it directly inside the implementation? (Exemple 3 vs 4)</p>

<p>Example 3</p>

<pre><code>@interface Class() {
    NSArray *mySortedArray;
}
@end

@implementation Class
@end
</code></pre>

<p>Example 4</p>

<pre><code>@implementation Class
NSArray *mySortedArray;
@end
</code></pre>

<p>I have a last question about coding conventions: when should I put an underscore (_) in front of a variable's name?</p>

"29546844","1","29547619","","2015-04-09 19:04:13","","0","53","<p>I want to use autolayout to center a view vertically and horizontally but somehow I'm having troubles doing so. I'm running on iOS8 simulator and iOS8 device. There are two versions of code which I have tried and none of them works. Below are the snippets:</p>

<p>First let's allocate the view we're using:</p>

<pre><code>UIView *inputView = UIView.new; //Don't hate me for the dot syntax :)
inputView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;
inputView.backgroundColor = UIColor.redColor;

[self.view addSubview:inputView];
</code></pre>

<p>Attempt #1:</p>

<pre><code>NSLayoutConstraint *constraint = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:inputView attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual toItem:self.view attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX multiplier:1.0f constant:0.0f]; //Center the view horizontally
[self.view addConstraint:constraint];

constraint = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:inputView attribute:NSLayoutAttributeWidth relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual toItem:self.view attribute:NSLayoutAttributeWidth multiplier:1.0f constant:0.0f]; //And make it have the same width as the view
[self.view addConstraint:constraint];

constraint = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:inputView attribute:NSLayoutAttributeHeight relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual toItem:nil attribute:NSLayoutAttributeNotAnAttribute multiplier:0.0f constant:260.0f]; //Force exactly 260pts view height
[inputView addConstraint:constraint]; //If I add it to self.view it's the same thing

constraint = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:inputView attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterY relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual toItem:self.view attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterY multiplier:0.5f constant:0.0f]; //And try to center it vertically - DOES NOT WORK... wtf
[self.view addConstraint:constraint];
</code></pre>

<p>Seems like a perfectly legitimate piece of code to me. But NOPE.</p>

<p>Attempt #2. It's basically the same thing with less lines of code.</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *constraints = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat:@""|-[inputView(&gt;=320)]-|"" options:NSLayoutFormatAlignAllCenterX metrics:nil views:NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(inputView)];
[self.view addConstraints:constraints];

constraints = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat:@""V:|-[inputView(260)]-|"" options:NSLayoutFormatAlignAllCenterY metrics:nil views:NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(inputView)];
[self.view addConstraints:constraints];
</code></pre>

<p>Now this one does not work either. I mean it does center the view horizontally but when I add the vertical constraint I do get a warning telling me that I suck at auto layout. It says its unable to satisfy all the constraints. More specifically: </p>

<pre><code>(
    ""&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x17408be00 UIView:0x174197010.top == UIView:0x174196da0.topMargin&gt;"",
    ""&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x17408bdb0 V:[UIView:0x174197010(260)]&gt;"",
    ""&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x17408bd60 UIView:0x174196da0.bottomMargin == UIView:0x174197010.bottom&gt;"",
    ""&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x17008a000 'UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Height' V:[UIView:0x174196da0(667)]&gt;""
)

Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint 
&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x17408bd60 UIView:0x174196da0.bottomMargin == UIView:0x174197010.bottom&gt;

As a sanity check, I tried running some code that was posted <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/16377267/553404"">in another answer</a>. Here it is, simplified a little more:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple
import pickle

P = namedtuple(""P"", ""one two three four"")

def pickle_test():
    abe = P(""abraham"", ""lincoln"", ""vampire"", ""hunter"")
    f = open('abe.pickle', 'w')
    pickle.dump(abe, f)
    f.close()

pickle_test()
</code></pre>

<p>I then changed two lines of this to use my named tuple:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple
import pickle

P = namedtuple(""my_typename"", ""A B C"")

def pickle_test():
    abe = P(""ONE"", ""TWO"", ""THREE"")
    f = open('abe.pickle', 'w')
    pickle.dump(abe, f)
    f.close()

pickle_test()
</code></pre>

<p>However this gave me the error</p>

<pre><code>  File ""/path/to/anaconda/lib/python2.7/pickle.py"", line 748, in save_global
    (obj, module, name))
pickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle &lt;class '__main__.my_typename'&gt;: it's not found as __main__.my_typename
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. the Pickle module is looking for <code>my_typename</code>. I changed the line <code>P = namedtuple(""my_typename"", ""A B C"")</code> to <code>P = namedtuple(""P"", ""A B C"")</code> and it worked.</p>

<p>I looked at the source of <code>namedtuple.py</code> and at the end we have something that looks relevant, but I don't fully understand what is happening:</p>

<pre><code># For pickling to work, the __module__ variable needs to be set to the frame
# where the named tuple is created.  Bypass this step in enviroments where
# sys._getframe is not defined (Jython for example) or sys._getframe is not
# defined for arguments greater than 0 (IronPython).
try:
    result.__module__ = _sys._getframe(1).f_globals.get('__name__', '__main__')
except (AttributeError, ValueError):
    pass

return result
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is what exactly is going on? Why does the <code>typename</code> argument need to match the name of the factory for this to work?</p>

<p>This query is running perfectly fine.
This will result in all the cycle_codes with exactly 4 rows for current month and future 3 months.</p>

<p>Now the requirement is if any of the month is missing.how could i show it?
for eg: the output of the above query is </p>

<pre><code>cycd  cm
102 1
102 10
102 11
102 12
103 1
103 10
103 11
103 12
104 1
104 10
104 11
104 12
</code></pre>

<p>Now lets say the row with cycd=104 and cm=11 is not present in the table,then the above query will not get the row <code>104 11</code>.
I want to display only those rows.
how could i do it?</p>

<p>The downside is that it makes it easier to try to use them as a silver bullet, applying them to every situation without thinking about the motivation behind them, and taking a second to consider whether a given pattern is really appropriate for the situation.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/251778/misused-design-patterns"">this question</a>, I'm not looking for design patterns that are <em>often</em> misused, but I'd love to see some examples of really solid design patterns put to bad use. I'm looking for cases where someone ""missed the point"" and either applied the wrong pattern, or even implemented it badly.</p>

<p>The point of this is that I'd like to be able to highlight that design patterns aren't an excuse to disable critical analysis. Also, I want to emphasise the need to understand not just <em>what</em> the patterns are, but <em>why</em> they are often a good approach.</p>

<p>The problem is that only the unique constraint is applied but not the not null constraint which means that oracle can store one null value which can lead to errors in the application... I tried to pair it with @NotNull from hibernate validator (which also creates a not null constraint normally) but again paired up with the unique constraint its not working.

<p>I'm 100% sure the issue isn't with the reading or writing of the image as I tested those functions without the filter applied and only get issues once I use the above function. </p>

<p>Any help is appreciated because as far as I can see, the indexing/formula seems to be correctly implemented but that is obviously not true.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: As Dave and others have pointed out, I am no longer 100% sure that the error is within the Sobel function and it appears this is just some indexing mistake I have made when using the .ppm format. I went ahead and posted the code for my .ppm reader/writer functions and the new results I am getting after applying the [y][x][color] scheme propsed by anatolyg below. I am sorry if my post is way too long and if it is please let me know as this is my first post and I am not entirely sure what is proper yet.</p>

So I want to get text from the <strong>onclick</strong>, put it on the <strong>href</strong> and then use the click method to follow the link. </p>

<pre><code> foreach (var el in doc.getElementsByTagName(""a"")){
  if (el is IHTMLAnchorElement){

    if ((null != ee) &amp;&amp; (null != ee.title) &amp;&amp; (ee.title.Contains(""LINK TITLE IS HERE""))){

     //I can not find a property or method to get the text from onclick!!!
     //HERE I WILL PARSE IT TO GET 'URL IS HERE'
     //HERE I WILL REPLACE THE HREF: ee.href = 'URL IS HERE'

<p>In the first case the result is 'no', while the second one shows 'yes'. Why the presence of the brackets in the string breaks the '.match'?

Ultimately all the fields need to be completed and I would like to incorporate the proper model level field validation before labeling the record as ""complete"".  I can think of a few ways to do this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create two tables, one for records in ""draft"" state, with looser validation rules (ie fields don't necessarily need to be complete for the record to be saved), and a second table to store the records that have been submitted as ""complete"", obviously with the more stringent validation rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Create only one table to store the records, with a field that is labeled ""isComplete"", and based on this value determine which validation rules to apply.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm leaning towards option #2 because it would involve less working parts (in option #1 I would have to ensure that when I change a records state from ""Draft"" to ""Complete"" it gets deleted from one table and added to the other).  The issue is I don't know how how do this elegantly in Rails.</p>

<ul>
<li>Carousel is a subclass of UIView</li>
<li>At init, it creates an UIView, containing UIScrollView, UIPageControl</li>
<li>I can add further UIViews to the scroll view</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know if this is the proper way to do it, but my example worked quite well in my TestApp. Swiping between pages works perfectly and the display of the current page in the UIPageControl is correct. </p>

<p>If there were not one single problem: The UIPageControl sometimes reacts to clicks/taps (I only tested in Simulator so far!), sometimes it doesn't. Let's say most of the time it doesn't. I couldn't find out yet when it does, for me it's just random...</p>

<p>As you can see below, I added </p>

<pre><code>[pageControl addTarget:self action:@selector(pageChange:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];
</code></pre>

<p>to my code. I thought this would do the proper handling of taps? But unfortunately, pageChange doesn't get always called (so the value of the UIPageControl doesn't change every time I click).</p>

<p>I would appreciate any input on this because I couldn't find any solution on this yet.</p>

<p>The same method calls when i click on submit button on add_publisher.xhtml page at the time of add or edit, when i add a publisher the method calls and inserts a record but when i edit a product then the same method should be called but this time for editing the product.
But the addPublisher() method of PublisherManager.java doesn't call.</p>

<p>Please help me to figure out my error.</p>

<p>For example, I have a csv file that was not properly created, say it's missing a comma, so when BizTalk tries to determine the message type, it errors out.  Without using failed message routing, there are 2 entries in the application event log.  One has a pretty generic error description, something along the lines of ""The Messaging Engine encountered an error during the processing of one or more inbound messages.""  The second entry has what I'm looking for.  It will contain the details of where the missing comma is, something along the lines of ""Unexpected data found while looking for:
','
The current definition being parsed is POSTrailer. The stream offset where the error occured is 44443. The line number where the error occured is 244. The column where the error occured is 1.""</p>

<p>I've tried using the ESB toolkit Exception Handler for BizTalk 2006 R2.  Using failed message routing and their exception handing framework, the error description it catches is the first, generic, error description.  </p>

<p>I do not see any way to obtain the second, more detailed error description.  I'm assuming somewhere in the bowels of the biztalk messaging engine this exception is getting thrown, which is caught by something a little bit higher in the process, which throws it's own generic biztalk exception.  I would also assume that the more specific error description is contained as the inner exception of the exception that gets routed to the ESB toolkit, however by the time I can get a hold of it, as far as I can tell, the actual exception object has been replaced by the message context, which is nothing more than a bunch of name/value pairs.  The error description is now the generic one that is not helpful, and anything resembling an inner exception is just a hexidecmal code, which means nothing to my end users.</p>

<p>Everything I've found regarding obtaining a specific error message deals with exceptions thrown from an orchestration.  I am not dealing with an orchestration, though, I'm dealing with a receive port.  The closest thing I can find is <a href=""http://www.implementsivillage.net/CommentView,guid,cab6343b-3479-4484-85c6-e7e9b5502b44.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.  But even if I could create a custom pipeline component using that, that means I either need to add that component into every exising custom pipline, or create a new one to validate XML and use that instead of the XMLRecieve or XMLSend pipelines that come with BizTalk...  That also means trapping errors generated from EDI is out of the question.  Does anyone know of a way to get at this more detailed error description from the BizTalk generated error message?</p>

I've come accross a rather annoying issue, and i'm pretty sure I'm not doing it wrong.</p>

<p>When I try to check if an username already exists in the MYSQL Database via PHP, it nags about the string being a boolean and not a variable.</p>

<p>This is the PHP code:</p>

<pre><code>if (isset($_POST['Submit1'])) 
{
    $username = $_POST['username'];
    if(IsNameInUse($username)) header(""Location: cselect.php?exist"");
}
else if (isset($_POST['Submit2'])) 
{
    $username = $_POST['username'];
    if(IsNameInUse($username)) header(""Location: cselect.php?exist"");
}
else if (isset($_POST['Submit3'])) 
{
    $username = $_POST['username'];
    if(IsNameInUse($username)) header(""Location: cselect.php?exist"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the ""IsNameInUse"" from my functions file:</p>

<pre><code>function IsNameInUse($username)
{
    $username = mysql_real_escape_string($username);
    $query = mysql_query(""SELECT COUNT(ID) FROM Accounts WHERE Username = '$username'"");
    return (mysql_result($query, 0) == 1) ? true : false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've already performed an: ""echo $username;"" and this clearly shows that a string is set as $username. It clearly gave me the string I entered. Now, I honestly have no idea why its giving the following error:</p>

<pre><code>[error] PHP Warning:  mysql_result() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /var/zpanel/hostdata/paradise/public_html/paradiseroleplay_com/includes/functions.php on line 7

<p>So here I am again, asking the never ending knowledge of the internet.

Heartfire.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Got it fixed.
""Sorry for this. The die on mysql error, clearly showed how stupid I can be. I forgot that for Accounts, I made it ""AccID"" and not ""ID""... Thanks a bunch, got it fixed now.""

<p>However, it produces the same cipher text each time it encrypts same piece of data. Is there anyway I can tweak this behavior and produce different cipher text for same piece of data?</p>

<p>I have implemented encryption in SQL server using AES_256 algorithm and certificate.

In this process each time a plain text is encrypted, different cipher text is produced.</p>

<p>I want the same effect with C# code. How that can be achieved?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Here is how I implemented the approach suggested by Yolanda Ruiz:</p>

<p><strong>Encrypt</strong></p>

<pre><code>public static string Encrypt(string plainText)
    {
        //Check for valid arguments.
        if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(plainText)) throw new ArgumentNullException(""plainText"");

        List&lt;byte&gt; encryptedList;

        //Create Aes object
        using (AesManaged aes = new AesManaged())
        {
            aes.Key = Key;
            aes.GenerateIV();
            encryptedList = aes.IV.ToList();
            aes.BlockSize = BlockSize;

            /*Here goes the standard code to encrypt the plain text - refer msdn for that*/
            /*Append the encrypted stream to encryptedList*/
        }

        return encryptedList.ToArray().ToBase64();
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Decrypt</strong></p>

<pre><code>        public static string Decrypt(string cipherText)
    {
        //Check for valid arguments.
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(cipherText)) throw new ArgumentNullException(""cipherText"");

        string plainText;
        byte[] cipherTextArray = cipherText.FromBase64();

        //Create Aes object
        using (AesManaged aes = new AesManaged())
        {
            aes.Key = Key;
            aes.BlockSize = BlockSize;
            aes.IV = cipherTextArray.Take(NoOfBytes).ToArray();//Extract the IV
            cipherTextArray = cipherTextArray.Skip(NoOfBytes).ToArray();//Extract the actual plain text.

            /*Here goes the standard code to Decrypt the cipher text - refer msdn for that*/
            /*Assign the decrypted stream output to plainText*/
        }
        return plainText;
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Unit Test</strong></p>

<pre><code>        //Arrange
        string plainText = ""Sayan"";

        //Act
        string cipherText1 = MyCrypto.Encrypt(plainText);
        string cipherText2 = Crypto.Encrypt(plainText);
        string plainText1 = Crypto.Decrypt(cipherText1);
        string plainText2 = Crypto.Decrypt(cipherText2);

        //Assert
        //Check the cipher text is different everytime
        Assert.AreNotEqual(cipherText1, cipherText2);

        //Check that every plaintext out put should match with the original
        Assert.AreEqual(plainText, plainText1);
        Assert.AreEqual(plainText, plainText2);

<p>I would like to have the user logged in (which I have), and I would like to then ask the user for their credentials again on certain pages. </p>

<p>I have one method through a EmployeeAuthenticatedMixin that I have made, which checks the POST data for the credentials. The main problem is the Mixin does not redirect, it merely serves up a page. So a user can hit the refresh button and resubmit the form, giving them access again.</p>

<p>Is there any way to ask for the user credentials and allow them access to the next page? Maybe an internal Django thing? Sessions? Messages?</p>

I want to program a void-method out of it, which does exactly the same and can then be used the following way:</p>

<pre><code>copy(String ""C:\\Old.txt"", String ""C:\\New.txt"", int 1, int 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Now copy does exactly the same as my old class copytest, it reads the old file, edits it and saves it. 
My first idea was to have two files as the first to arguments, but this is obviously impossible. My new idea is to give the method two strings of the wanted directories of the old and the new file. It still doesn't work. I hope, you understand, what I want to do and how to solve this problem.</p>

The search form is based on a script ajax and when you click on the search button, a script jquery intercepts the call and creates the ajax call for wordpress. This call launches a method within a class of wordpress plugin in question, which handles the data passed through $ _POST from the search form.
Then are shown the results and clicking on one of these you will sended to the single page.
The script I'm trying to do should allow the user to return from the single page to search results using the back button of browser. The problem is that this script working fine in local on my pc, but once loaded online this plugin stops working. (Sorry for the long introduction but it served to define the problem well).</p>

<p>The script works as follows: </p>

<ol>
<li>Fill the search form and click on search button</li>
<li>$_POST is filled with the form data and I fill $_SESSION with $_SESSION = $_POST</li>
<li>Open a result and go to the single page then hit back in the browser</li>
<li><p>Force the refresh of the page setting with controls $_POST = $_SESSION
(the ride is much more complicated but this is the principle on which it is based).</p>

<p><strong>ajaxResult php function</strong>
This function is called on search button click</p>

<pre><code>// Check if user came from single page or from search page
if(!$_POST &amp;&amp; $_SESSION['back_to_hardsoft_results']) {
    if( $_SESSION['back_to_page'] ) {
        $_POST = $_SESSION['back_to_hardsoft_results'];
        $_SESSION['back_to_page'] = null;
    }
} else if( $_POST &amp;&amp; $_SESSION['back_to_hardsoft_results']) {
    $_SESSION['back_to_hardsoft_results'] = null;
}

...some controls with the $_POST data...

$search = $this-&gt;getQueryObject($this-&gt;type, $this-&gt;taxonomies, $this-&gt;historicalFilter());

include_once TEMPLATE_PATH . CUSTOM_POST_SLUG . '-' . RESULTS_PAGE . '-page.php';

} else if ( ...$_GET...) { ...other things... }
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>When user visit the single page, a $_SESSION['back_to_page'] is created.</p>

<p><strong>getQueryObject php function</strong> Called by ajaxResult</p>

<pre><code>$args = array ( ...some args... );          
$q = new WP_Query ( $args);

// Save the query for back to results from single_mediateca_page
$_SESSION['back_to_hardsoft_results'] = $_POST;

return $q; }
</code></pre>

<p>I've put on js file the follow string to force the refresh of page.</p>

<pre><code>history.navigationMode = 'fast';
</code></pre>

<p>I think the problem may also relate to the browser's cache, but I don't know if is really due to it the problem.

My problem is another; i have this class that i use to map a specified Json, in order to deserialize it and subsequently serialize it:</p>

<pre><code>public class Version {

    private String status;
    private String updated;
    private String id;
    private List&lt;Link&gt; links;
    @XmlElement(name = ""media-types"")
    private List&lt;MediaTypes&gt; media_types;

    //constructor + getter and setter
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is about the element <em>media_types</em> and the use of the annotation <em>@XmlElement</em>. Before i insert the ContextResolver to personalize ObjectMapper all works fine, in fact after serialization i obtain a json in which the element/attribute <em>media_types</em> has as name <em>media-types</em>; on the contrary with ContextResolver this element doesn't change it's name and has <em>media_types</em>. I think that, during serialization, the annotation <em>XmlElement</em> doesn't work, but i'm not sure that this is the correct reason.
Another attempt i try to do is to put <em>@JsonProperty(""media-types"")</em> annotation instead of <em>@XmlElement</em> annotation but with no result; in fact with this annotation i obtain also a Processing Exception.
The last attempt (in addition to what has been suggested by the previous post) was that of insert these lines of code in the ContextResolver:</p>

<pre><code>AnnotationIntrospector intr = new AnnotationIntrospector.Pair(new JaxbAnnotationIntrospector(),new JacksonAnnotationIntrospector());
            // usually we use same introspector(s) for both serialization and deserialization:
            result.getDeserializationConfig().withAnnotationIntrospector(intr);
            result.getSerializationConfig().withAnnotationIntrospector(intr);
</code></pre>

<p>in order to use both JaxbAnnotation and JacksonAnnotation but the name of the field in question remain <em>media_types</em>.
I hope i was clear in explain my problem and thanks you in advance for your help!</p>

It does not seem to fill each element with a unique element (using its default value or default constructor). I'm having trouble finding more information about this.</p>

<p>Is there a way to make the <code>multi_array</code> fill itself with a unique object at each element?</p>

<p>For example, consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>static int num = 0;

struct A {
   int n;
   A() : n((::num)++) {
      std::cout &lt;&lt; ""A()"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
   }
   virtual ~A() {}

   void print() {
      std::cout &lt;&lt; ""n="" &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; std::endl;
   }
};

int main() {
   std::cout &lt;&lt; ""vector:"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
   std::vector&lt;A&gt; v(3);
   for (auto x : v) {
      x.print();
   }

   std::cout &lt;&lt; ""multi:"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
   boost::multi_array&lt;A, 2&gt; m(boost::extents[2][2]);

A()
A()
n=0
n=1
n=2
multi:
A()
n=3
n=3
n=3
n=3

<p>Essentially what I want is to have multiple plus/minus icons on a page that when clicked toggle the icon and show a specific DIV based on an ID value.</p>

<p>Looking at this example below, the content in the DIV would be hidden until the icon was clicked. Once clicked the plus icon changes to a minus icon. If the minus icon were clicked, the content would be hidden again. Multiple DIV's should be allowed to be shown at the same time, so it's almost like each toggle should be independent.</p>

<p>[... if there could be a 'show/hide all' link that would be awesome!]</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" id=""content1""&gt;[Plus Icon]&lt;/a&gt; Content Title&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""content1""&gt;This is some content. Really exciting content!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" id=""content2""&gt;[Plus Icon]&lt;/a&gt; Different Content&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""content2""&gt;Here is more content. This content is less exciting.&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note: In my above example, the div that display are right below the link, but that is not always the case. Sometimes the toggle link is in a different spot.</p>

<p>As you can see, I want to be able to specify an ID in the toggle link that corrosponds to the DIV to be displayed hidden.</p>

<p>And, if the showing/hiding could be animated with a  sliding effect, that would be good.</p>

<p>The two scripts I have from the other question I found do almost what I want, except they only relate to one DIV and don't have the ID type system I'm describing.</p>

However,  the problem I am having is that twelve hours prior to this point I had trouble free access to this server.  Now, with no known changes, I can no longer connect.  </p>

<p>I can login to this server all day long without a problem.  However, when I try to execute a remote command, say ssh servername 'ls /var/tmp', the connection disconnects without a logged error on the server.</p>

<p>So, what changed?  </p>

<p>Here is my git config:</p>

<pre><code>wwwin-svn-sjc:142&gt; git config --list
receive.denynonfastforwards=false
user.name=joericks
user.email=joericks@cisco.com
http.postbuffer=52428800000
</code></pre>

<p>I bumped my http.postbuffer to an obscene level to eliminate that as a potential problem.
I can switch to another account and clone these repositories from this server using the exact same URLs without a problem.  Other admins and users are unaffected as well.
When local to the server and using the problem account, I can add, commit and push to remote servers all day long without a problem.   </p>

<p>Outside of Git I can force remote ssh commands to complete using ssh -t but that is really a work around and my users just won't accept a work around if I can't tell them why / how this happens or what caused it.  I blew away my .ssh config settings and ssh keys.  Attempting to clone without the keys brought up the requisite password prompt and the same failure.</p>

<p>I verified that permissions were sane for the .ssh files and parent directories:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ls -alrt  
total 712  
-rw-r--r--  1     58 Sep 15 17:02 config  
-rw-r--r--  1 681826 Mar  7 12:24 known_hosts

drwxr-xr-x 78  24576 Mar  7 15:25 ..  
</code></pre>

<p>I have purposely kept my ssh config as simple as possible:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;cat config  
ForwardX11 yes   
ForwardAgent yes  
StrictHostKeyChecking no  
</code></pre>

<p>Using ssh -vvv I come back with this output.  (truncated for brevity)</p>

<p>A dropped connection to the problematic server:</p>

<pre><code>debug2: channel 0: open confirm rwindow 0 rmax 32768

<p>A good call to a functional server:  </p>

<pre><code>debug3: packet_send2: adding 48 (len 67 padlen 13 extra_pad 64)

<p>At this point I am really at a loss and unfortunately I have at least one other user that is encountering this same issue.  Has anyone ever figured out what exactly causes this problem (tty allocation fails unless expressly forced) and short of a knee jerk reboot of the system found a fix to correct the problem?</p>

Nothing has been drastically modified in either one, but the one is displaying as it should and the other is missing various styles and functionality.</p>

<p>I know the cause of the problem - a 404 error on the one site for two resources. These resources are PHP files stored in the theme's directory in both installations - one is used as a CSS file and the other a Javascript file. But in the one they are both fine, in the other they are exhibiting unusual behaviour.</p>

<p>Basically if you go to the URL for the resource, you will get the content displayed (even though it 404s) but as script-src ref or link-href in the browser the content seems to be ignored (probably as it should be!). What I don't get is why the one blog is returning a 404 for these two files (which definitely exist) and he other one is absolutely fine!???</p>

<p>I can't see any differences in Wordpress either. But this only seems to have happened since the host updated Wordpress across all installations...</p>

<p>here's my code so far:</p>

for(int i = 0;i &lt; [categoryBtnImages count]; i++)
{
    UIButton *but = (UIButton *)[catButtonArray objectAtIndex:i];

int tagOfButton = buttonCat.tag - 2;

if (tagOfButton == -2 ){
    tagOfButton = 8;
}
[buttonCat setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:[categoryBtnImagesSel objectAtIndex:tagOfButton]] forState:UIControlStateNormal];
</code></pre>

<p><strong>I would like to put the delay here</strong> then run the rest of the code, but all from within this method.</p>

<pre><code>if ([sender.titleLabel.text isEqualToString:@""Button 0""]) {
    [self foodCatSort:nil];

}
if ([sender.titleLabel.text isEqualToString:@""Button 1""]) {

    [self.tableView reloadData];

}
if ([sender.titleLabel.text isEqualToString:@""Button 2""]) {
    [self shoppingCatSort:nil];
    [self.tableView reloadData];

}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>FYI the reason I want to do this is because a button is pressed which reloads the table and the button state image changes. I would like the user to see the uibutton image change first then reload the table. I was thinking a delay would solve this.</p>

<p>Note: I'm using the following packages to build my collection schemas, Simple Schema <a href=""https://atmospherejs.com/aldeed/simple-schema"" rel=""nofollow"">https://atmospherejs.com/aldeed/simple-schema</a></p>

<p>The page that I'm using to insert the data into this particular collection has a section that based on the choice the user makes they are presented with more options.</p>

<p>For example focusing in on one question there are some checkboxes, by default none are selected but if the user selects any checkbox they are given more options to choose from either via checkboxes or text areas. The point is that they will have additional options to choose from based on their selection.</p>

<p>I think the best way to handle how the data is inserted is via the template helpers for that specific section so that's not the question.</p>

<p>Instead where i'm confused is at the collection level and how to Schema that information or if I even need to.</p>

<p>For example let's say you have a question that involves pets.</p>

<p>The question could be: Do you have pets?</p>

<p>The checkbox options could be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dogs</li>
<li>Cats</li>
<li>Other</li>
</ol>

<p>By default all of these checkboxes are unchecked but if the user checks any of the boxes then a text area is revealed (again i realize all of this happens at the Template.events and Template.helpers level).</p>

<p>What my real question is, now that I've set the scenario, is how do you store information like that or schema it to allow these kinds of values.</p>

<p>Assuming that all of the functions to grab this data are all on the Template.helpers level so this is simple a question about how to store kind of data in this scenario.</p>

<p>My notion was to do something like this (using the simpleSchema package):</p>

<pre><code>Pet = new SimpleSchema({
 petInstructions: {
  type: String,
  optional: true,
  allowedValues: ['Dogs', 'Cats', 'Other']    
 }
});
</code></pre>

<p>However I'm not certain this is right again let me re-iterate that I do want the checkboxes to have the values 'Dogs', 'Cats', 'Other' and the text area when any of these are checked so that the end-user can enter more information about their pets.</p>

<p>What i'm unclear about is if I'm thinking about how this data's Schema could be or how this kind of information should be stored in the MongoDB.</p>

<p>I feel like there should also be a property for the TextArea input, would that be a good way to think about it?</p>

<p>For example (adding on to the example above):</p>

<pre><code>Pet = new SimpleSchema({
     petInstructions: {
      type: String,
      optional: true,
      allowedValues: ['Dogs', 'Cats', 'Other'],
      textArea: """"
     }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Should I just leave another property/value for that particular content?</p>

<p>This is somewhat of a granular level question that understanding something simple like this would help clarify other questions I had.</p>

<p>I want to know the difference between LLDB and GDB debugger in detail. Everywhere it is mentioned as ""LLDB is faster and memory-efficient than GDB"" . I want to know in what sense it is faster and memory efficient.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When I use LLDB, in the variables view of the debug area , member variable of that particular class or view controller are not displayed(count). 
And to the local array when objects are added the objects are not displayed in variables view, but the number of object is displayed(count).</p>

<p>example(in variables view):</p>

<p>arrayOfComments    NSMutableArray *    0x068a6700   1 Object</p>

<p>->NSArray  NSArray </p>

<p>->NSObject</p></li>
<li><p>When I use GDB, in the variables view of the debug area , member variable of that particular class or view controller are displayed.

<p>->0   Comment *   0x6804940 (the object is displayed here)   </p></li>
<li><p>I came across an article saying LLDB understands the dot syntax.</p>

<p>po self.property</p>

<p>But when I use it in GDB it works even for ""po self.property.previousProperty'sProperty"" but doesn't work in LLDB. so now how does LLDB understands dot syntax.</p></li>

<p>It seems to me like if Omniauth allows for multi-provider, it should also allow for single-provider, in which case using it is almost always a better option because you never know when you want to add another provider later on, whereas with something like Omniauth-Facebook, if you decide to add something else at a later point you have to backtrack.</p>

<p>What I really want to do is <code>sum {func(x)}</code>, so I defines a <code>FuncEvalF</code> functor to make use of <code>thrust::tranform_reduce</code></p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;

{
    const FunctionObj&lt;T&gt;&amp; f_obj;

<p>Finally in the <code>main.cu</code> I call the <code>transform_reduce</code></p>

<pre><code>auto func = FuncEvalF&lt;float&gt;(FunctionObj&lt;float&gt;());
    float result = 0;
    try

        result = thrust::transform_reduce(thrust::device, thrust::device_pointer_cast(dev_a), thrust::device_pointer_cast(dev_a + 10000), func, static_cast&lt;float&gt;(0), thrust::plus&lt;float&gt;());

    }

    {

<p>Here the exception comes : <code>bulk_kernel_by_value</code>, even I change the 10000 to 10. Thing only goes better when I change the defintion of <code>FuncEval</code> to</p>

The problem is that the object does not use the Java-beans naming convention because the properties can be dynamic in some cases.  Instead, the objects have methods like <code>object.getAttr(""attribute_name"")</code> and <code>object.setAttr(""attribute_name"", value)</code>.  It would be easy for me to write an implementation of BeanWrapper to wrap this type of object, because there are methods for querying what attributes are available, etc.</p>

<p>I also don't need custom editors because the properties are mostly built-in types.  All I need is a way to customize the data binding or find some other way to plug in my custom BeanWrapper so that Spring's form tag will know how find the properties on the object when binding the form values.  Seems like this should be fairly easy (that <strong>is</strong> why BeanWrapper is an interface, right?) but I am just not seeing it...</p>

After <a href=""http://forums.gradle.org/gradle/topics/ant_imports_taskdefs_failed_to_create_task_or_type_junit"" rel=""nofollow"">further research</a>, it seems that Gradle uses its own instance of ANT.

<p>where <code>numctrl_ccm90</code> and <code>numctrl_ucp90</code> are the widgets corresponding to the collimated counts at -90deg and the uncollimated counts +90deg etc. </p>

<p>I assume I should create some kind of binding that updates a variable/list/dictionary with the counts for each NumCtrl widget. I am not sure how I should do this and in what format is best for subsequent plotting. For example when I enter 1234 counts in numctrl_ccm90 I would like to store this information as <code>counts: 1234 collimator:Y Angle: -90.</code></p>

<p>When I finish typing in the data I would press the plot button, which would pick up the counts value in each numCtrl box (apart from the fwhm numctrl) and would place all this information in a structure that allows plotting</p>

<p>For the plot - I plot normalised counts for collimated and uncollimated detector versus angle. What is the best way to approach this task. I'm pretty lost at this moment</p>

<hr>

<p>I have my counts in a list of lists now </p>

<pre><code>self.angle_list = []
self.angles_list.append([-90,'U',self.numctrl_ucm90.GetValue()])
self.angles_list.append([-75,'U',self.numctrl_ucm75.GetValue()])
</code></pre>

<p>where each element of angle_list is a list with format [angle, collimator, counts]</p>

<p>Not sure how this helps me plot. What I need is a scatter plot of angle vs counts for the 2 combinations 'U' vs 'C'. </p>

<pre><code>HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; matrix = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Considering that the Object is an ArrayList with data:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; matrix.keySet().size() * 2; i += 2) {           
    keyRow.createCell(i).setCellValue(matrix.keySet().toArray()[i / 2].toString());

</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the outer loop fills the keyRow with the strings of the keySet() of the HashMap while lefting behind an empty cell in between (It gets incremented by 2).
The inner loop is supposed to fill cells under each key with each corresponding value (which is an ArrayList with more values, that's why is another loop). It works beautifully except for the fact that the APACHE POI worksheet.createRow() method OVERWRITES the previous results, giving the final result of just one key being properly filled.</p>

However, I can't seem to figure out the syntax to actually use it to print when I'm using gdb. Basically I <em>want</em> to be able to type something like ""myObject->print()"" and have it run my print method but instead I get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
  Reason: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at address: 0x00000000000000a1

  being debugged was signaled while in a function called from GDB. GDB
  remains in the frame where the signal was received. To change this
  behavior use ""set unwindonsignal on"" Evaluation of the expression
  containing the function (wfSamplePath::print_traj(std::ostream&amp;)) will
  be abandoned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where ""wfSamplePath"" is my class and ""print_traj"" is my print method (with std::cout as the default argument). So clearly something is wrong with how I think I can do this. I'm using gdb from within xcode 3. ""myObject"" is definitely in scope, as I can access some of its other methods. </p>

<p>What I want to do is have subdomains - like apply.domain.com/(.*) - rewrite but NOT redirect to a WordPress page - <a href=""http://domain.com/page/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domain.com/page/</a>$1</p>

<p>I can get this working as a redirect using the rule below, but cannot seem to figure out how to get it to work ONLY as a rewrite.</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^apply\.domain\.com [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://domain.com/apply/$1 [NC,L]
</code></pre>

<p>Even though I do not have the R flag, it is still doing it as a redirect, presumably because I have the full domain path in the RewriteRule.</p>

<p>However, if I attempt to omit it...</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /apply/$1 [NC,L]
</code></pre>

<p>I get a 500 error, which doesn't make much sense to me because I have done countless RewriteRules in that fashion and had them work properly with simply a relative path to rewrite to.  I figure this must be because of the HTTP_HOST condition.</p>

<p>The next thing I tried was playing with the document root of the subdomain - trying the same root folder as the WordPress site and .htaccess, and also multiple hierarchies of subfolders, differently named than the WordPress page so as to avoid conflict with WordPress' .htacess:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
</code></pre>

<p>I even tried /subs/apply/ thinking I could then write a very simple rule</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^subs/(.*) http://domain.com/$1 [NC,L]
</code></pre>

<p>Which works, but STILL forces it to redirect instead of rewrite.</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^subs/(.*) /$1 [NC,L]
</code></pre>

<p>Produces a 500 error.</p>

<p>I have flexibility over the document root of the subfolder and can put it wherever it needs to go in order to achieve this.  Just need to get it actually working!</p>

I have a web app written in ASP.NET, that will be running off of a Windows 2003 Server machine using IIS 6.0. When I run it locally, it works perfect. When I run it from the server, the site works fine. The issue lies in writing to a remote folder. I have a network folder using AD permissions that the application writes to. With my AD account (when I write it locally) it authenticates properly, but when using the IIS account it does not. Has anyone come across this? Any solutions available?</p>

<p>So far, I've tried using my AD account as the ""Guest Account"" in IIS that the site runs off of, but that still didn't work.</p>

<p><code>while(true){<br>
var1 = app2stream.readInt();<br>
app1stream.writeInt(var1);<br>
var2 = app1stream.readDouble();<br>

 app2.accept();</code></p>

<p>Is there any way around this? It would be great to allow the two applications to connect to the server regardless of who ""came"" first and then wait for the server to proceed with the above code.

I have been going over previous exams and one of the q's is to write the code for a program that displays an order form, but I am stuck on is the Ajax to keep the total (prices) box updated as amounts of products are ordered.</p>

<p>I have it working, but only if an amount is typed in once. In my solution if someone goes and changes an amount (say from 1 to 3) then it will add the price of 3 more of that product obviously not an ideal solution. I realise that a loop needs to be added, but after many hours of trying I can't get it to work properly. I realise this exact problem won't be in the exam but I would like to get my head around it as there will be something similar.</p>

<p>In the actual html code the form is created dynamically, according to what is in the database. The text box is generated with the id of the product as the text box id and the name is amt[] so that these can be sent to getTotal.php to work out the cost.</p>

<p>Here is the javascript/ajax that is activated on the onchange of textbox:</p>

<pre><code>function getAmt(txtBox){ //in solution won't need to use this text box

    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    var id = txtBox.id; //id from the textbox - in solution won't need these two
    var amt = txtBox.val; //value that has been typed into the textbox

    var total = document.getElementById(""total"").value; //get current total value

    xhr.onreadystate = function(){

        if(xhr.readyState==4 &amp;&amp; xhr.status == 200)
        {
              var result = xhr.responseText;
              document.getElementById(""total"").value = result;//place new total in form
        }

    }
    xhr.open(""GET"", ""getTotal.php?amt=""+amt+""&amp;id=""+id+""&amp;tot=""+tot);
    xht.send(null);
}
</code></pre>

<p>To get what I want, which is instead of using the current total and only the current text box, is that everytime there is a change to process each text box and overwrite the total with a new total.
To do this I don't have the pass the txtBox value as I need to loop through all of the id's &amp; values from amt[]</p>

<p>This code does that:</p>

<pre><code>var arrayAmt = document.getElementsByName(""amt[]"");
var id;
var amt;
for(i=0; i&lt;arrayAmt.length; i++)
{
    id = arrayAmt[i].id;
    amt = arrayAmt[i].value;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am just stumped of where to put the for loop, or what part of the ajax call goes inside the loop.</p>

<p>I tried many different formats yesterday, and lost lots of study time.</p>

<p>I would really appreciate any suggestions on how to make this work</p>

<p>(can't use anything else such as jQuery)</p>

<p>Cheers </p>

"25612786","1","25612970","","2014-09-01 20:53:59","","3","86","<p>I have a Spring controller that takes posts and it works. The only problem is that our SMS providers will be sending us headers that contain keys with a capitalized first letter, for example:</p>

<pre><code> {
""FromPhoneNumber"":""15177754077"",
""ToPhoneNumber"":""17572046106"",
""ResponseReceiveDate"":""7/29/2014 5:25:10 AM"",
""Message"":""PIN 1234""
}
</code></pre>

<p>Spring will throw an error like: </p>

<pre><code>    ""Could not read JSON: Unrecognized field ""FromPhoneNumber"" (class com.talksoft.spring.rest.domain.CDynePost), not marked as ignorable (4 known properties: ""responseReceiveDate"", ""toPhoneNumber"", ""fromPhoneNumber"", ""message""])
</code></pre>

<p>So, there must be a way for me to override this behavior. Here is the controller method that handles the CDyne posts:   </p>

<pre><code>    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST, value=""/celltrust"")
    public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; cellTrustPost(@RequestBody CDynePost cDynePost) {
        String message = ""FAILED"";
        UserInteraction userInteraction = getUserInteraction(cDynePost);
        boolean success = someSpringService.logMessage(userInteraction);

        if (success) {
            message = ""OK"";
            return new ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt;(message, HttpStatus.ACCEPTED);
        } else {
            return new ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt;(message, HttpStatus.FAILED_DEPENDENCY);
        }       

    }
</code></pre>

<p>and here is the CDynePost class:</p>

<pre><code>public class CDynePost {
    private String FromPhoneNumber;
    private String ToPhoneNumber;
    private String ResponseReceiveDate;
    private String Message;

    public String getFromPhoneNumber() {
        return FromPhoneNumber;
    }
    public void setFromPhoneNumber(String FromPhoneNumber) {
        this.FromPhoneNumber = FromPhoneNumber;
    }
    public String getToPhoneNumber() {
        return ToPhoneNumber;
    }
    public void setToPhoneNumber(String ToPhoneNumber) {
        this.ToPhoneNumber = ToPhoneNumber;
    }
    public String getResponseReceiveDate() {
        return ResponseReceiveDate;
    }
    public void setResponseReceiveDate(String ResponseReceiveDate) {
        this.ResponseReceiveDate = ResponseReceiveDate;
    }
    public String getMessage() {
        return Message;
    }
    public void setMessage(String Message) {
        this.Message = Message;
    }
}

<p>I've looked at ObjectMapper but I am not sure how to work this into my controller, and truth be told I'd prefer not to have to write a bunch of extra classes if Spring will do it for free. </p>

<p>Presently I have a PostgreSQL database. I want to keep this around because there's permanent data like user records I don't want to put in Mongo (unless you guys can convince me otherwise). I really have nothing against Mongo, but I can normalize some things with users and the only way I could think to do it without massive amounts of duplication is via PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>Now my API data is flat, and in JSON. I don't need to create any sort of link to any other table and it has a field that I can use as a key pretty easily. My idea is to literally ""throw"" the data into a Mongo instance and query as needed, invaliding every X days. This also offers some persistence should the server go down for whatever reason.</p>

<p>So my questions to you guys are this. Is this a good use case for Mongo over memcached? Should I just memcached the raw data instead? If you guys do suggest Mongo, should I move my users table and the relations over to Mongo as well?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"16987765","1","","","2013-06-07 15:29:12","","2","268","<p>I have a .NET 4.5 WPF application which displays a number of icons in a grid - those icons are loaded through setting the ImageSource of an Image control to a specific URL (no authentication necessary). Additionally, there is a button which can be pressed to retrieve some data from an internal web service which is secured with windows authentication (NTLM, not Kerberos) via HttpClient.</p>

<p>I've noticed some exceedingly strange behaviour with this setup. If I leave it as is, when the button is pressed, the NTLM handshake will actually fail after the first step (client will send request and receive 401, then refuses to send again with auth headers). However, if I change the ImageSource to bind to nothing, or to a local file, or create the ImageSource manually by downloading the file with the HttpClient in the background, the NTLM handshake completes as normal.</p>

<p>This seems to happen with any NTLM site, and any site hosting an image. Has anyone experienced this before?</p>

<p>Here's an example of this happening in a test app I threw together.

{
    public string Image { get; set; }

    public ICommand DownloadData { get; set; }

            {
                using(var handler = new HttpClientHandler { Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultNetworkCredentials })
                using (
                    var client = new HttpClient(handler)
                        {
                            BaseAddress = new Uri(""http://somentlmservice.com"")
                        })
                {
                       var data = client.GetAsync(""/someresource"").Result
                }

            });

However, one class has a virtual 'init()' function which can be overridden by a derived class if necessary. </p>

<pre><code>// C++ class 
class MyClass : public QObject
{
 Q_OBJECT
 public:
  MyClass() 
  {
   init(); // perform user initialization
  }
  virtual void init() {}
};
</code></pre>

<p>The MyClass constructor calls the virtual function 'init()'. It is intended that when MyClass is sub-classed that the init function can be overridden if necessary to provide user initialization. </p>

<p>I wish to use 'MyClass' in PythonQt so I have written a wrapper class: </p>

<pre><code>class MyClass_Wrapper : public QObject
{
 Q_OBJECT
public Q_SLOTS:
 // add a constructor
 MyClass* new_MyClass() {return new MyClass(); }
 void init(MyClass* mc) { mc-&gt;init(); }
};
</code></pre>

<p>The class 'MyClass' is now registered with PythonQt:</p>

<pre><code>    PythonQt::self()-&gt;registerCPPClass(""MyClass"",NULL,""myModule"", PythonQtCreateObject&lt;MyClass_Wrapper&gt;);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I create a Python script to use 'MyClass':</p>

<pre><code>import myModule
Class TestClass(MyClass) :
  def init(self):
  # init() is called exactly once at the beginning to do
  # any necessary configuration.
  print ""Inside init(self)""
  .
  .
  .
  return
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the print statement (and the following code) is never executing. The init() function is not being overridden by the PythonQt code. </p>

Is this functionality really broken - is the documentation really that wrong? Or am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>Support for doing just this was added in BBOS 4.5 and allegedly exists through version 6. There's <a href=""http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Web-and-WebWorks-Development/Map-Links-Support/m-p/47454/highlight/true#M306"" rel=""nofollow"">an old thread about it on the BlackBerry forums</a>; one of the sample websites in that thread does not work on the Storm 2, while the other application is down.</p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/deliverables/11944/Open_BB_Maps_from_the_BB_Browser_898721_11.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">Per the documentation, BBOS 5 allegedly supports both KML and the proprietary BlackBerry location markup language XLOC.</a></p>

<p>I figured at least XLOC would work, since <a href=""http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/deliverables/17954/Open_BB_Maps_from_the_BB_Browser_1264587_11.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">version 6 allegedly retained support for XLOC and dropped KML support</a>. But nope.</p>

<p>I'm running 5.0.0.713 in the Storm 2 simulator and 5.0.0.1015 on a physical Storm 2.</p>

<p>I'm thinking the documentation is just wrong. Nothing I can do works - KML, KMZ, XLOC, dynamic generation, static files with proper MIME types, etc., etc., etc. This really shouldn't be this hard!</p>

<p>Here's something to ponder: if you go to a map on maps.blackberry.com in the browser... why is there no option to open it in Blackberry Maps?</p>

<p>As this is a professional web project, I can't publicly share the environment. I may be able to duplicate the relevant parts on my personal server, though. It's really frustrating, as we'd really like to support BlackBerry users, but we're starting to think it's not possible.</p>

<p>If anybody can produce a working example of doing this (for the BlackBerry Storm 2 specifically), I would be extremely grateful. If anybody can confirm that it's not possible, that would be worth something as well.</p>

MainMethodID is a BIGINT and I already use indices for ""starttime"" and ""MainMethodID"".

While it doesn't exceed the amount of memory we can work with, it is common to not be able to get a continuous block of memory that large without getting errors. This block of memory is just a image buffer and while it is unlikely to consume all of it if I try to supply it a smaller block and it consumes it it crashes. Also note that the large amount of memory is the maximum size the device supports, but the amount the device needs at any given time is based on what the user is doing with the device.</p>

<p>The 3rd party is unwilling to make any changes to their DLL. I asked if they would be will to just take a file path and have the DLL dump the data to a raw file on the hard drive.</p>

<p>Anyway, I don't know how to word what I am looking for, and I doubt it is even possible, but I am looking for some way of passing in a IntPtr that instead of pointing to a continuous block of memory points to a file stream or something that goes straight to a file on the hard drive. Is something like that possible? If so, what kind of .Net namespace do I need to look in.</p>

I am using newSingleThreadExecutor() from class Executors which is scheduled with scheduleWithFixedDelay() with 100 ms delay, other code is just DB read/write (so nothing special that would create new waiting threads)...

<p>}</p>

<p>However I cannot get matrices and vector <code>( M = U ∑ V* )</code></p>

<p>What's the problem?
The most strange part is, function dsvd changes three matrices 
that is : aa (in this case, 4*5 size) , ww vector (it is changed to 4*5 matrix) and vv (5*5 matrix). </p>

<p>However, SVD should have three matrix :
U ( 4*4 matrix) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;- where is it?
∑ ( 4*5 matrix. actually it is made by ww vector)
V*( 5*5 matrix. vv matrix)</p>

<p>because dsvd changes <strong>aa, ww, vv,</strong> I guessed that aa is U. However dimension of matrices are different <strong>aa</strong>(4*5), <strong>U</strong>(4*4). That's the reason why I asked this question. In summary, dsvd should give three result matrices (or two matrices, one vector). It only changes <strong>aa, ww, vv</strong>. <strong>ww</strong> and <strong>vv</strong> are correct I guess. However the left one <strong>aa</strong> cannot be matrix (<strong>U</strong>) because it does not have same dimension. Is there any way that changes <strong>aa</strong>(4*5 matrix) to <strong>U</strong>(4*4 matrix) ?</p>

<p>I want to get matrix <code>U, V*</code> and vector <code>∑</code> and confirm it by using </p>

   for(~)

1. Explain the difference between running nginx as a web server vs. using it like a reverse proxy. What are the benefits?
2. We also want to use nginx as a load balancer (and have that already setup in testing), but we haven't enabled cacheing on the load balancer. So while its helping redirect requests, its not really serving any traffic directly and it simply passes through everything to one of the two apache servers. </p>

<p>The question is that we have a lot of user-generated content coming from the apache servers, how do we invalidate the cache for only certain pages that are being cached by nginx? If we setup a cron to clear this cache every 1 minute or so, it wouldn't be that useful... as cache would then be virtually non existent. </p>

<p>Does this mean that the OS will also unmap the pages when they're no longer in use? Is it possible to mark pages as being no longer in use? This data is read-only, if that changes the scenario. How about if we were to use <code>mmap()</code> directly? Would this be preferable?</p>

<p>Our business users are not interested in the server, just the data.

<p>As you can see from this ERD, I'm designing a logger that keep track of actions of several type of users.
In instance, every record in the logger.log table will have only one related record in one of the related logger.relate.* tables.</p>

<p>Using Phalcon Model as a stand-alone, I have 7 models, one for the main table and 6 for the relationship tables:</p>

<ul>
<li>Log</li>
<li>LogRelateCarrier</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>In the Log model class I used the hasMany() method to set a 1-n relationship; in the other model classes I used the belongsTo() method for n-1 relationships.</p>

<p>My question:
is there a way in Phalcon to directly handle scenarios like this one, so that I'd be able to get as log record actor's ID just by doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>$log        = Log::findFirst(1);
$id_actor   = $log-&gt;getIdActor();   // Getter method for actor's ID
$actor_type = $log-&gt;getActorType(); // Getter method for actor's type (customer, carrier, etc.)
</code></pre>

<p>having the getters very simple, something like (excuse me, I'm really new to this framework):</p>

<pre><code>public function getIdActor() {
    return $this-&gt;id_actor;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, I would like to know if there's a way in this framework to handle such a scenario without having to script myself other selection routines. And, whenever possible, with some performance (as I'm holding the actor's type in the logger.log class to know which relational table I'll have to query, instead of querying all the relational tables and then computing only the one record from the one only table that holds it).</p>

<p>Finally, I did used so many relational tables as I need the data layer (and not the logic one) to enforce the constraints between the log table and the many different actors external tables.</p>

<p>Hope I explained the situation, thank you very much!</p>

<pre><code>//mocking a user object with some random data
User user createMockUser(loginName, firstName, lastName, salutation, company, mailAddress);

foo(user);
</code></pre>

<p>and the focus on the test is to test foo(user).</p>

<p>With these variants for createMockUser():</p>

<p>Using when functions:</p>

<pre><code>protected User createMockUser(String loginName, String firstName, 
        String lastName, String salutation, String mailAddress) 
{
    User user = Mockito.mock(User.class);

    Mockito.when(user.getLoginName()).thenReturn(id);
    Mockito.when(user.getFirstName()).thenReturn(firstName);
    Mockito.when(user.getLastName()).thenReturn(lastName);
    Mockito.when(user.getSalutation()).thenReturn(salutation);
    Mockito.when(user.getMailAddress()).thenReturn(mailAddress);        
    return user;
}
</code></pre>

<p>using spy:</p>

<pre><code>protected User createMockUser(String loginName, String firstName, 
        String lastName, String salutation, String mailAddress) 
{

    User spyUser = spy(new User());
    spyUser.setLoginName(loginName);

<p>and this wouldn't work at all:</p>

<pre><code>protected User createMockUser(String loginName, String firstName,

    User user;
    user = Mockito.mock(User.class);

    user.setSalutation(salutation);
    Mockito.when(user.getMailAddress()).thenReturn(mailAddress);        
    return user;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am still new to mockito, but from what I get, spy really uses the object's methods to have the values in the object and when just makes the get function call to return what is indicated in the mock. But for this test, they do basically the same result-wise, since I only want to test foo. 
So, which one would be better or is there an even more elegant way? </p>

The one feature we are being asked to implement is that when an editor publishes an article, that that article gets posted to the company's facebook wall as well.</p>

<p>The tricky part to this is that the people who are allowed to publish articles may not have login credentials to the company's overall FB account.  This means that I can't rely on the normal process to retrieve access tokens for accounts (or so it seems).</p>

<p>I did quite a bit of research and came up with the following documentation sources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/docs/howtos/login/extending-tokens/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/howtos/login/extending-tokens/</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/docs/howtos/login/server-side-login/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/howtos/login/server-side-login/</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/docs/concepts/login/login-architecture/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/concepts/login/login-architecture/</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/roadmap/offline-access-removal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/roadmap/offline-access-removal/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>From these it seems that in order to allow locally authorized users to post to the company's facebook wall I must:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a user with valid FB credentials log into an Admin page</li>
<li>Click a button to start the authorization process</li>
<li>Retrieve the short term access token from the FB response and exchange it for a long-lived 60 day token</li>
<li>Store the 60 day token in our database</li>
<li>Each time a user attempts to publish an article, test if the token has expired and if so alert the admin they need to re-authorize.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this the only workflow to accomplish this or is there a simpler method, preferably one that does not require the last step.</p>

<p>So I believe Doctrine returns the data as an array I guess and I am trying to access its values as if they were objects that's why I get this error.</p>

<p>I also tried using foreach loop inside If statement before populating TemplateReponse but this also did not work. Any idea how I can make this work.</p>

<p>The pattern is a base 'find[Type]s' method in my service layers which abstracts select query creation to a single point in the service, but supports the ability to quickly create easier to use proxy methods (see the example PostServivce::getPostById() method way below).</p>

<li>Reduce possibility for errors introduced by distinct re-implementation</li>

<p><em>Phewf</em></p>

<p>The benefits of this base function are:</p>

<ol>
<li>it allows me to quickly support new conditions and options as the schema evolves</li>
<li>it allows me a means to quickly implement global conditions on the query (for example, adding an 'excludeDisabled' option with a default of true, and filtering all disabled = 0 models, unless a caller explictly says differently).</li>
<li>it allows me to quickly create new, simpler to use, methods which proxy calls back to the findPosts method. For example:</li>
</ol>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>class PostService
{
    /* ... snip ... */

    // A proxy to getPosts that limits results to 1 and returns just that element
    public function getPost($conditions = array(), $options()) {
        $conditions['id'] = $id;
        $options['limit'] = 1;
        $options['paginate'] = false;
        $results = $this-&gt;getPosts($conditions, $options);
        if(!empty($results) AND is_array($results)) {
            return array_shift($results);
        }
        return false;
    }

    /* ... docblock ...*/       
    public function getPostById(int $id, $conditions = array(), $options()) {
        $conditions['id'] = $id;
        return $this-&gt;getPost($conditions, $options);
    }

    /* ... docblock ...*/
    public function getPostsByAuthorId(int $id, $conditions = array(), $options()) {
        $conditions['Author.id'] = $id;
        return $this-&gt;getPosts($conditions, $options);
    }

    /* ... snip ... */
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong><em>MAJOR</em></strong> drawbacks with this approach are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The same monolithic 'find[Model]s' method gets created in every model-accessing service, with mostly only the condition switch construct and base table names changing.</li>
<li>No simple way to perform AND/OR conditon operations. All conditions explicitly ANDed.</li>
<li>Introduces many opportunities for typo errors </li>
<li>Introduces many opportinuties for breaks in the convention-based API (for example a later service may require implementing a different syntax convention for specifying the orderBy option, which becomes tedious to back-port to all previous services).</li>
<li>Violates DRY principles.</li>
<li>Valid conditions and options are hidden to IDE auto-completion parsers and the options and conditions parameters require lengthy doc block explanation to track allowed options.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the last few days I've attempted to develop a more OO solution to this problem, but have felt like I'm developing TOO complex a solution which will be too rigid and restrictive to use.</p>

<p>The idea I was working towards was something along the lines of the following (current project will be Doctrine2 fyi, so slight change there)...</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>namespace Foo\Service;

use Foo\Service\PostService\FindConditions; // extends a common \Foo\FindConditions abstract
use Foo\FindConditions\Mapper\Dql as DqlConditionsMapper;

use Foo\Service\PostService\FindOptions; // extends a common \Foo\FindOptions abstract
use Foo\FindOptions\Mapper\Dql as DqlOptionsMapper;

use \Doctrine\ORM\QueryBuilder;

class PostService
{
    /* ... snip ... */
    public function findUsers(FindConditions $conditions = null, FindOptions $options = null) {

        /* ... snip instantiate $q as a Doctrine\ORM\QueryBuilder ... */

        // Verbose
        $mapper = new DqlConditionsMapper();
        $q = $mapper
                -&gt;setQuery($q)
                -&gt;setConditions($conditions)
                -&gt;map();

        // Concise
        $optionsMapper = new DqlOptionsMapper($q);        
        $q = $optionsMapper-&gt;map($options);


        if($conditionsMapper-&gt;hasUnmappedConditions()) {
            /* .. very specific condition handling ... */
        }
        if($optionsMapper-&gt;hasUnmappedConditions()) {
            /* .. very specific condition handling ... */
        }

        if($conditions-&gt;paginate) {
            return new Some_Doctrine2_Zend_Paginator_Adapter($q);
        } else {
            return $q-&gt;execute();
        }
    }

    /* ... snip ... */
}
</code></pre>

<p>And lastly, a sample of the Foo\Service\PostService\FindConditions class:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>namespace Foo\Service\PostService;

use Foo\Options\FindConditions as FindConditionsAbstract;

class FindConditions extends FindConditionsAbstract {

    protected $_allowedOptions = array(
        'user_id',
        'status',
        'Credentials.credential',
    );

    /* ... snip explicit get/sets for allowed options to provide ide autocompletion help */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Foo\Options\FindConditions and Foo\Options\FindOptions are really quite similar, so, for now at least, they both extend a common Foo\Options parent class. This parent class handles intializing allowed variables and default values, accessing the set options, restricting access to only defined options, and providing an iterator interface for the DqlOptionsMapper to loop through options.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after hacking at this for a few days now, I'm feeling frustrated with the complexity of this system. As is, there is still no support in this for condition groups and OR conditions, and the ability to specify alternate condition comparison operators has been a complete quagmire of creating a Foo\Options\FindConditions\Comparison class wrap around a value when specifying an FindConditions value (<code>$conditions-&gt;setCondition('Foo', new Comparison('NOT LIKE', 'bar'));</code>). </p>

<p>I'd much rather use someone else's solution if it existed, but I've yet to come across anything that does what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>I'd like to get beyond this process and back to actually building the project I'm working on, but I don't even see an end in sight.</p>

<p>So, Stack Overflowers:
- Is there any better way that provides the benefits I've identified without including the drawbacks?</p>

<pre><code>myfunction &lt;- function(var) {
        &lt; do something to mydata$var &gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>var</code> could be the name of any of the columns in <code>mydata</code> (a data.frame).</p>

<p>The issue is with the <code>dataframe$var</code> part of the code. I can't figure out how to dynamically call a variable name like that. <code>dataframe[,var]</code> doesn't seem to work, nor does <code>dataframe[,get(var)]</code> or <code>dataframe[,eval(var)]</code>. </p>

<p>I'd also like to use this same theory to loop through a vector of specific columns in <code>mydata</code>:</p>

<pre><code>varlist &lt;- c(""var1"",""var2"",""var3"")
for (var in varlist) {
    &lt; do something to mydata$var &gt;
}

<h2>Method 1 (Jquery draggable function)</h2>

<p>I've tried the jquery draggable function as you can see in this <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/kd9wuquv/"" rel=""nofollow"">jsfiddle</a> example.</p>

<p>The problems I found in this example are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Biggest concern</strong>: The droppable container does not change when it is scaled up. So if the element is being dragged over part of the scaled container that isn't a part of it's original size, it will fail.</li>
<li>When you click to drag a div, it teleports a little bit away from the mouse and is not a <em>seamless</em> drag.</li>
</ul>

WealthMarginAnalyser.Model
WealthMarginAnalyser.Helpers</p>

<p>The main XAML file is in namespace WealthMarginAnalyser</p>

<p>I want to be able to declare namespaces for the other ones, such as WealthMarginAnalyser.ViewModel - and I thought it was as simple as putting a single line in the XAML to declare that as a CLR namespace, but apparently not.</p>

<p>Given that they are all in the same assembly solution, there are no compiled DLLs to right click and change properties on, it is a single file WPF application, all namespaces within the same solution/assembly.</p>

<p>What's going on here? I'm using the same name in both places, but <code>FindName</code> can't find it. I've tried using Snoop to see the hierarchy, but the form doesn't show up in the list of applications to choose from. I  searched on StackOverflow and found I <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1274943/window-findname-cant-find-border-element-that-ive-named-through-an-attached-pro/1275422#1275422"">should be able to use VisualTreeHelper class</a>, but I don't understand how to use it.</p>

<p>I did this step-by-step instruction <a href=""http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-to-load-in-and-animate-content-with-jquery/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-to-load-in-and-animate-content-with-jquery/</a> and it seems to be so easy. The result: works with Webkit and Gecko, but IE 7 + 8, what a surprise, they load no content. The demo of nettuts do it in IE, so what the hell did I wrong?</p>

<p>The code:</p>

<pre><code>// Check for hash value in URL
var hash = window.location.hash.substr(1);

// load content
var href = $("".mainNav li a"").each(function() {
    var href = $(this).attr('href');
    if (hash == href.substr(0,href.length-5)) {
        var toLoad = hash + "".html #content"";
        $(""#content"").load(toLoad)
    }
});

$("".mainNav li a"").click(function(){
    var toLoad = $(this).attr('href') + ""#ajaxedContent"";

    $(""#content"").fadeOut(300,loadContent, function(){
        dynHeights();                                               
    });

    $(""#load"").remove();
    $('#logo').append('&lt;div id=""load""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');
    $(""#load"").fadeIn(100);

    window.location.hash = $(this).attr('href').substr(0,$(this).attr('href').length-5);

    function loadContent() {
        $(""#content"").load(toLoad,'',showNewContent())
    }

    function showNewContent() {
        $(""#content"").fadeIn(300, function() { 
            dynHeights();
            hideLoader();
        });
    }

    function hideLoader() {
        $(""#load"").fadeOut(300);
    }

    return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>Note: the dynHeights() helps to change heights of shadow borders and should not be part of the problem</p>

<p>any ideas? would be appreciated.</p>

it 'is not valid with a bad question type' do

<p>Long short story : I try to get a socket server to which some clients connects trough a VPN (I know, my server is not multithread for now..., I will need some more skills on this!) to get the most recent configuration to generate multiple config files for asterisk in my concern today. The server is a simple PHP socket script <code>socket.php</code> and the client consists of a gateway <code>action.php</code> for any module, these ones using classes from php-cli scripts in their respective app/ directory. So i have for example <code>modules/pbx/app/update_sip.php</code> which uses <code>modules/pbx/classes/PbxGenerateConfig.php</code> to get (and write) config files from the socket server json responses, trough the <code>modules/api/classes/ApiServer.php</code> socket client. I hope it's clear for everyone ;)</p>

<pre><code>asterisk -rx ""transcoder show""
</code></pre>

<p>which provides the output I need to log. This output looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>5/5 encoders/decoders of 120 channels are in use.
</code></pre>

<p>I wanted to write a line to a log file that would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS     #encoders     #decoders
</code></pre>

<p>and then I'd log this every couple of minutes, and I'd have a history of how many channels I was using. So I wrote a little php script:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
exec(""asterisk -rx \""transcoder show\"" | sed 's|\\([0-9]*\\)\/\\([0-9]*\\).*|\\1:\\2|'"",$retval);
$time = date('Y-m-d h:i:s');
$vals = explode("":"",$retval[0]);
$encoders = trim($vals[0]);
$decoders = trim($vals[1]);
$logString = ""$time\t$encoders\t$decoders\n"";
$fh = fopen('/root/script/trans.log','a');
fwrite($fh,$logString);
fclose($fh);
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Sorry, the code is a little funky there, theoretically I should have been able to output exactly what I needed from sed, but the code you see there is after I had changed it to try to address the problem you'll se below. In testing, I found the sed script worked fine from the command line; it output #encoders:#decoders as expected. But, when I ran the php script, it was writing lines like this to the log file:</p>

<pre><code>2011-06-13 10:24:02     ^[[0;37;40m6    6
</code></pre>

<p>I can't figure out where the ^[[0;37;40m is coming from. It's a color code, I understand, to set the color for displaying the text in the shell, but is that something sed is adding, or is it coming from the original output? How do I get rid of it? If I use an echo statement to print the variables $encoders and $decoders to the command line, there is no special color formatting, nor is there in the output from the original asterisk -rx command.</p>

<p>The principle was the same so I decided to make something really short and clearly understandable.
$value was just bad copy &amp; paste. Before I realized I didn't delete all of my old code (just <strong>$</strong> was left) and edited my post, some people already replied. It wasn't the correct answer but I just didn't want to close the question without giving points to anyone.</p>

<p>The code above will not work unless if you change it to;</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
 // Put the code here
});
</code></pre>

<p>Considering my jquery code is in between <code>&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;</code> I have to use <code>$(document).ready</code></p>

<p>I have a Jquery UI progress bar which updates based on the percentage completed. I could upload one file. But when I select multiple files to upload, it gives an internal server error. The progress bar is not working at all in either of the cases (uploading one file or multiple file)</p>

<p>Could someone have a look and what is wrong in my code?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I got the multiple files issues sorted. But still couldnt get the progress bar updating.</p>

<p>That works great in all modern browser except Safari 7.1, incredibly the original works but my modification not, I think the problem is with the sibling selector. Any idea???</p>

I wanted to cache CSS, Images and JS files on the browser for infinite time and did not want to cache HTML. So, when I have any changes to the CSS or JS or images I can update the query parameter in the HTML and the browser would fetch the latest version of the asset.</p>

<p>Our app is on Glassfish 3.1.2 so I could not use mod_headers like in Apache to control the behavior. What I ended up doing was add a filter and add Cache-control response header to all css, js and images. This works for css and images fine but all those models and collections that are a result of using backbone.js are not being updated. Well, I could not figure out how to erase them from the cache if I have an updated version on the server.</p>

<p>Any pointers on this issue would help me figure this out.</p>

<p>The problem ....</p>

<p>Using JQuery AJAX I am unable to simultaneously POST data to a php file and receive json encoded data from the php file.  If the json dataType is included I am unable to POST data from the form to the php file.   If I do not specify the json dataType (i.e. comment it out) then I can POST data to the php file but cannot receive the json encoded data.</p>

<p>I've tried this with my own js/php code and for source code that I downloaded, in order to compare results in case it was just a mistake in my coding.  Both are 'submit forms' and both exhibit the problems outlined above.  In case its relevant, I include the downloaded source code below.  My js/php code uses similar ajax requests.  </p>

<p>javaScript:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

        $(document).ready(function(){

            $(""#myForm"").submit(function(){
                dataString = $(""#myForm"").serialize();
                $.ajax({
                    type: ""POST"",
                    url: ""postForm_ajax.php"",
                    data: $(""#myForm"").serialize(),
                    dataType: ""json"",
                    contentType: ""application/json; charset=utf-8"",
                    success: function(msg){
                        $(""#formResponse"").removeClass('error');
                        $(""#formResponse"").addClass(msg.status);
                        $(""#formResponse"").addClass(msg.status);

                    },
                    error: function(){
                        $(""#formResponse"").removeClass('success');
                        $(""#formResponse"").addClass('error');
                        $(""#formResponse"").html(""There was an error submitting the form. Please try again."");
                    }
                });

                //make sure the form doens't post
                return false;


            });


        });
    &lt;/script&gt;

<p>the PHP:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

        return TRUE; 
    } else {

        return FALSE; 
    }
}
}   



//response array with status code and message
$response_array = array();

}


echo json_encode($response_array);

<p>EDIT....One Solution</p>

<p>Ok...so I found a hack that works.   I don't specify the dataType:'json', i.e. comment that line and the contenType line out.  Then I'm able to POST the data.  Still have the php file echo the json_encode($response_array).  Then put the following code in the success function</p>

<pre><code>var obj = jQuery.parseJSON(msg);
$(""#formResponse"").addClass(obj.status);
$(""#formResponse"").html(obj.message);
</code></pre>

<p>This is not as nice as being able to specify the dataType:'json' in the ajax call.  If anyone has a better solution or can explain why this problem is occurring, let me know.  </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

 <code>[^\p{L}\p{N} ]+</code> but that seems to match punctuation too. I have also tried <code>[\p{Xan}]</code>. </p>

<p>Now, I realize I'm testing these on a website called <a href=""https://www.debuggex.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Debuggex</a> and the reason these might be working is the fact that Unicode support in regular expressions in JavaScript seems to be limited.

<h2>Research Effort</h2>

<p>You can find the Group Policy option under:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>**Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy**</p>
  
  <p>Enforce password history</p>
  
  <p>This security setting determines the number of unique new passwords that have to be associated with a user account before an old password can be reused. The value must be between 0 and 24 passwords.</p>
  
  <p>This policy enables administrators to enhance security by ensuring that old passwords are not reused continually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like all group policy options, it is stored in the registry. Unfortunately it is stored in an undocumented registry location:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\F</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an <a href=""http://www.beginningtoseethelight.org/ntsecurity/index.htm#BB4F910C0FFA1E43"" rel=""nofollow"">undocumented binary blob format</a>.</p>

<p>There <strong><em>is</em></strong> a WMI class <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa375062.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>RSOP_SecuritySettingBoolean</strong></a>, but without any context, it's just a name hanging out there - which i have no idea how to read through COM/native.</p>

<h2>NetValidatePasswordPolicy</h2>

<p>Windows does provide an <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa370661%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396"" rel=""nofollow""><code>NetValidatePasswordPolicy</code> API</a> that will allow it to validate your password for things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>too many bad attempts</li>
<li>account lockout</li>
<li>lockout automatic reset</li>
<li>minimum password age</li>
<li>maximum password age</li>
<li>password reuse</li>
</ul>

<p>and it will do all these things following the group policy in effect on the computer. And it all works great, except for password history.</p>

<p>The function requires you to pass a list of password hashes, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$2a$14$mACnM5lzNigHMaf7O1py1OLCBgGL4tYUF0N/4rS9CwDsI7ytwL4D6</code></li>
<li><code>$2a$14$mACnM5lzNigHMaf7O1py1O3vlf6.BA8k8x3IoJ.Tq3IB/2e7g61Km</code></li>
<li><code>$2a$12$.TtQJ4Jr6isd4Hp.mVfZeuh6Gws4rOQ/vdBczhDx.19NFK0Y84Dle</code></li>
<li><code>$2a$12$Ro0CUfOqk6cXEKf3dyaM7OhSCvnwM9s4wIX9JeLapehKK5YdLxKcm</code></li>
</ul>

<p>as well as the hash of the new candidate password, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$2a$10$1JsBs47iuMNsV166PKV.u.56hlT5/tRe9V5t5FIdfA0axpDSQuNN</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This will cause <strong>NetValidatePasswordPolicy</strong> to check if your current hash matches any of the existing hashes. Unfortunately, the entire concept of checking previous password hashes only works when you use a weak password algorithm (<a href=""http://www.passcape.com/index.php?section=docsys&amp;cmd=details&amp;id=28#41"" rel=""nofollow"">such as PBKDF2 that Windows uses</a>).</p>

<p>Because i use a modern, <em>expensive</em>, <strong>salted</strong>, password hashing algorithm (BCrypt/SCrypt), a hash cannot be deterministically generated from a password alone - i can't simply check the old list. I would have to rehash the user's new password against <strong>every</strong> previously stored salt. </p>

<ul>
<li>not only is this an expensive operation; potentially taking 12 seconds to check all 24 stored hashes</li>
<li>i don't know when to stop, because i don't know the Password History group policy value (e.g. i would be checking all 24 stored hashes, when i only need to check zero).</li>
</ul>

<p>I have considered calling <code>NetValidatePasswordPolicy</code> with a dummy list of 24 stored password hashes, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>a</code></li>
<li><code>b</code></li>
<li><code>c</code></li>
<li><code>d</code></li>
<li>...</li>
<li><code>v</code></li>
<li><code>w</code></li>
<li><code>x</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The API will then tell me that it password has did not match any in the <code>n</code> history. But the API is also designed to return to you what you have to keep. It <em>might</em> then return:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$2a$10$1JsBs47iuMNsV166PKV.u.56hlT5/tRe9V5t5FIdfA0axpDSQuNN</code></li>
<li><code>a</code></li>
<li><code>b</code></li>
<li><code>c</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And from that i might be able to infer that the password history length is <strong>four</strong>.</p>

<p>But i've not gotten there yet.</p>

<p>I'm three days into this, and losing patience.</p>

<ul>
<li>why did Microsoft obfuscate the group policy?</li>
<li>why did Microsoft not allow people to read it?</li>
<li>why is it undocumented?</li>
<li>how do i get it all the same?</li>
</ul>

<li>Change default filter values, e.g. set year to 2011 (+submit) [ = state1 ]</li>
<li>Go to a drillthrough report</li>
<li>Go back (year is set to 2012 again) [ = state2 ]</li>
</ol>

<p>With the default SSRS report.aspx, going back (step 4) is 2012 as expected. However, with my custom webconfig+ReportViewer aspx, the filters are different than before (2011 again).</p>

<p>My changes to web.config to bypass a previously encountered error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The type Microsoft.ReportingServices.UI.WebControlConnection, ReportingServicesWebUserInterface, Version=10.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89845dcd8080cc91 does not implement IReportServerConnection</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The web.config now has:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;appSettings&gt;
    &lt;add key=""ReportViewerServerConnection"" value=""Microsoft.ReportingServices.UI.WebControlConnection, ReportingServicesWebUserInterface, Version=10.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89845dcd8080cc91"" /&gt;
    &lt;add key=""ReportViewerTemporaryStorage"" value=""Microsoft.ReportingServices.UI.ReportViewerTemporaryStorage, ReportingServicesWebUserInterface, Version=10.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89845dcd8080cc91"" /&gt;
    &lt;clear/&gt;&lt;!-- added --&gt;
&lt;/appSettings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To bypass the error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In remote mode, the Report Viewer control requires session state be enabled or Report Server connection information specified in the config file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've changed:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;httpModules&gt;
    &lt;clear /&gt;
    &lt;add name=""Session""  type=""System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateModule""/&gt;&lt;!-- added --&gt;
    ...
    ...
&lt;/httpModules&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'd be pleased to receiving your thoughts and/or suggestions/solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
Additional screenshots to the previous mentioned steps:</p>

<p>Step 1  ( = Step 4 custom )<br>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ycEem.png"" alt=""parameter settings at step 1""></p>

<p>Step 2  ( = Step 4 default, desired )<br>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/QiuxI.png"" alt=""parameter settings at step 2""></p>

<p>Step 4: going back with the default ssrs gives me Step 2 (as desired), with my custom gives me Step 1. I would like to achieve getting back at Step 2 also with my custom page.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong><br>
<em>Investigation with WebkitInspector</em></p>

<p>In ssrs default aspx, going back in the browser (desired functionality):</p>

<p>Initially the filters are also in default state, but the server writes additional JS on the page, which initiates the update of the filters to previous settings. The point is that I dont know how to ""automatically"" write these additional JS (I think it is session/history related, in stead of programmatically storing &amp; checking for history).</p>

<p>Further, I have been suggested to:</p>

<ol>
<li>use dev toolbars or fiddler/wireshark for investigating session parameters.</li>
<li>querying the ReportServerTempDb</li>
</ol>

<p>I will try #1, I'm really not sure where to begin concerning #2 though.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
Appearently in IE only, it has some BrowserNavigationCorrector.js.
When you render a page, first the initialize is executed, which does a <code>setTimeout('doInitialize',0)</code>. After that - before the doInitialize will be executed -, the page writes/renders JS: <code>add_init(*NavigationCorrectioncode*);</code>
On doInit, the NavigationCorrector checks the PageState (in <code>OnAppLoad()</code>), which does NOT have the value 'Loaded' yet.
Then everything else happens, and the pagestate will get the value Loaded.</p>

<p>Then, when you go to a subreport and hit back, the page has in memory the state 'Loaded'. So when the NavigationCorrector executes its code, and the pagestate IS Loaded, it triggers a TriggerPostBack-script. This in turn, does a callback which updates the parametervalues.</p>

<p>Using WebForms.dll v11, the BrowserNavigationCorrector.js doesn't exist. Also, using Chrome, it also isn't included in neither SSRS native or using the dll.</p>

<p>Basically I can try to include that file manually, or, I'm currently trying to download VS2013 which hopefully has an improved version of the dll, maybe v12..?</p>

I do not believe this should be a hard and fast RULE!<br />
I wrote a comment on my <a href=""http://dotnetbob.blogspot.com/2007/11/links-and-usability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">blog</a> awhile back about this after another developer complained that I was not following web standards. It is coming up again, and I want to know what you think. Her argument was that for consistance and usability, ALL links had to be underlined ALL the time. My manager agreed, so I changed two lines in a css, and it was done. I did not mind doing the work, but I think the usability of the site is less now. There are way too many things screaming for your attention.<br /><br />
I should mention that this is a web site with many pages of data entry. The links in question were navigation links to the left of the page in a box that was titled ""Menu"". The underline did appear when you hovered over the link already, and the background color changed when the user hovered over the link. I really could not believe I was even having the discussion. I was even more shocked when my manager agreed.<br /><br />
Am I wrong? What other arguments should I have made? Thanks! :)</p>

<p>The issue I am facing now is how to read in the words.  We are given a file with 80 words that is like the generic ""dictionary"" for this project. I was thinking of using either the <code>fopen()</code> function or manually typing in the words (which would suck...). I am facing another problem of how to store the words. I was thinking of a 2d array where each column or row was a word.  There is a limit of 10,000 words and they can be no more than 6 letters long.</p>

  #use strict;
  use warnings;

  #use File::Slurp;

  #declare variables
  my $file = '';
  my $verbose = 0;

  #iterate through the files in input directory

     #read the file into a single string
     open FILEHANDLE, $file or die $!;
     my $string = do { local $/; &lt;FILEHANDLE&gt; };

     #perfrom REGEX on this string

     $count = 0;
     while ($string =~ m/%INCLUDE/g)
     {
        #%include
        $count++;
     }
     if ($count &gt; 0)
     {
        print "" $count %INCLUDE\n"";
     }
     $count = 0;
     while ($string =~ m/INCLUDE/g)
     {
        #%INCLUDE;
        $count++;

        print "" $count INCLUDE\n"";
     }
     $count = 0;
     while ($string =~ m/(%include\s+')[A-Za-z0-9]+:([A-Za-z0-9]+.[A-Za-z]+')/g)
     {
        #$1$2;
        $count++;
     }

     {
        print "" $count XXXX:include \n"";
     }        
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This produces output as desired, an example is below:</p>

<pre><code>  C:\users\perry_m\desktop\epic_test\pascal_code\BRTINIT.PAS
   1 INCLUDE
   2 XXXX:include 
   39 external and readonly
</code></pre>

<p>However if I change the regex operations to try and implement a replace, using the replacement operation shown in the commented lines above, the scripts hangs and never returns. I imagine it is somehow related to memory, but I am new to Perl. I was also trying to avoid parsing the file by line if possible.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>  while ($string =~ s/%INCLUDE/%include/g)
  {
     #%include
     $count++;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>  while ($string =~ s/(%include\s+')[A-Za-z0-9]+:([A-Za-z0-9]+.[A-Za-z]+')/$1$2;/g)
  {
     #$1$2;
     $count++;
  }

Is there any way to make flex load files from the file system automatically without the user having a web server setup? I know it can be done with AIR but we would prefer not to do that. Also if we are forced to use AIR, is it possible to embed an air application in a web page the same way as you embed a flex app? The flex app is embedded seamlessly as shown here:</p>

<li>Go to www.eyespeakpro.com Click on ""free trial"" after choosing your gender.

<li>Ignore that lesson and click on the speech bubble 2nd from the left in the bottom right corner. This brings up the flex app, and if you watch the network traffic you can see the files being downloaded if you click the right arrow for the next sentence etc.</li>

So I can store product details when ever they are changed.
Also I can load all the products into a <strong>hash map</strong> or such a <strong>data structure</strong> at the beginning and keep track of those product objects.
what matters to me is out of above both which one is more <strong>efficient</strong> and <strong>productive</strong>. Can someone help me. Thank you!</p>

For example, a property file will have some key/value pairs like that:</p>

<pre><code>file.input=csv
data.type=multi
data.separator=;
...etc
</code></pre>

<p>So in this case, depending on a property value(for example, 'csv'), I'll call CSV processing related classes, depending on 'data.type' value, I'll update the corresponding model values (e.g. class MultiCastXXX). The aim is to have something more or less generic like an API and be able to process no matter what is defined in a property file (of course with some conventions and restrictions applied). What do you think, any ideas ? Thank you.</p>

My issue here is not writing the shell script but more providing a parameter to the shell script (so a function in a way) to be able to complete the request.</p>

<p>In essence I want to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run script with parameter from SSH (""somscript reponame"")</li>
<li>Create repo: svnadmin create /var/www/svn/reponame</li>
<li>Change repo owner: chown -R apache.apache /var/www/svn/reponame -R</li>
<li>Do security changes: chcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/svn/reponame/</li>
<li>And chcon -R -t httpd_sys_rw_content_r /var/www/svn/reponame</li>
<li>Create default directories: svn import -m 'Initial import' /tmp/svn-structure-template/ <a href=""http://domain.com/svn/reponame/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domain.com/svn/reponame/</a> (localhost is not accepted by stackoverflow)</li>
</ol>

<p>Can anyone offer some guidance or perhaps provide an alternative I can use? Would a PHP script work (so to run it from a browser and use a query string of some sort and would this not cause some security issues as apache is the default owner and some of these may require root / sudo access).</p>

I am writing an application which uses Scribe to connect to an OAuth Server. I need to be able to change the endpoints in run-time (without recompiling). Is this possible?</p>

<p><strong>More details</strong><br/>
A java server application is using scribe to connect to an OAuth server. The OAuth-server is developed in-house, so I am extending <code>DefaultApi10a</code> to define the endpoints.</p>

<p>There are multiple instances of the OAuth-server, and I need to be able to configure my server application (in run-time) which one to connect to. But it seems that the endpoints are intended to be hardcoded in my sub-class of <code>DefaultApi10a</code>. Is there a good way around this?</p>

<p>The simplest solution I have come up so far is rotating the matrix and summing up each row:</p>

<pre><code>board
[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]

pr(board)
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8

pr(zip(*board))
0 3 6
1 4 7
2 5 8

<p>0..9 numbers above are just for showing positions on the board, normally they would be filled with 1 for player 1 and -1 for player 2 and 0 for unfilled position. Go row by row and if it sums up to 3 or -3 this is the winning block.</p>

<p>However, diagonals are not checked. Is there some way to extract diagonals from such matrix in elegant + highly performant way? I don't mean using trivial indexes ""manually"" (0, 1, 2), but rather get diagonal of n x n matrix.</p>

<p>P.S. pr is just a helper function for printing 2d list:</p>

"8742282","1","8743681","","2012-01-05 12:10:43","","4","3579","<p>We are working on different integrations to a swarm of identically structured legacy databases that basically cannot be altered. For this, we added an auxiliary database for holding things like meta-information, routing rules and for temporarily holding data for the legacy databases. </p>

<p>We are mainly using NHibernate to connect to the databases. One application is a WCF Service that needs to inserts incoming data into nested tables that are really wide (dozens of columns). Obviously, performance is an issue, so I have been looking to be as economic as possible with the NHibernate transactions. At the same time, concurrency appeared to be an issue. In production, we were starting to get some zombied transaction errors (deadlocks). </p>

<p>I have been doing a balancing act to deal with these two issues but haven't really eliminated the concurrency problems.  </p>

<p>The service behaviour is set to handle one request at a time, like so: </p>

<pre><code>[ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.PerCall, ConcurrencyMode=ConcurrencyMode.Single]
public class LegacyGateService : ILegacyGateService
</code></pre>

<p>Earlier, after some ""inspiration"" (read: copy/paste) from the internet, I ended up adding a set of classes called something like XxxNHibernateUtil, for the auxiliary database and the legacy databases, respectively. These classes control the NHibernate Sessions and generate or re-use the Sessions from pre-initialized SessionFactories. </p>

<p>For the Auxiliary database it looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>public static class LegacyGateNHibernateUtil
{
    private static readonly ISessionFactory sessionFactory = BuildSessionFactory();

    private static ISessionFactory BuildSessionFactory()
    {
        try
        {
            Configuration Cfg = new Configuration();
            Cfg.Configure();
            Cfg.AddAssembly(""LegacyGate.Persistence"");
            return Cfg.BuildSessionFactory();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            throw ex;
        }
    }

    public static ISessionFactory GetSessionFactory()
    {
        return sessionFactory;
    }

    public static ISession GetCurrentSession()
    {
        if (!CurrentSessionContext.HasBind(GetSessionFactory()))
            CurrentSessionContext.Bind(GetSessionFactory().OpenSession());

        return GetSessionFactory().GetCurrentSession();
    }

    public static void DisposeCurrentSession()
    {
        ISession currentSession = CurrentSessionContext.Unbind(GetSessionFactory());

        if (currentSession != null)
        {
            if (currentSession.IsOpen)
                currentSession.Close();
            currentSession.Dispose();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever a session is needed for a transaction, the current session is looked up and re-used for the duration of the service request call. Or at least: That is what is supposed to be happening. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The session context is of course set in the hibernate.cfg.xml like so: </p>

<pre><code>  &lt;property name=""current_session_context_class""&gt;call&lt;/property&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For the legacy databases, the NHibernateUtil is adapted to deal with different possible databases. For this, each connection gets its own SessionFactory built that has to be looked up in a Dictionary collection. Otherwise, the principles are the same. </p>

<p>Testing using WCFStorm, this seems to be working fine when sending one request at a time, but as soon I start a load test, even with just one agent and long intervals, I get a plethora of different kinds of exceptions all pointing to simultaneous requests and transactions sabotaging each other. I have tried tweaking the IsolationLevel, but of now avail. </p>

<p>I think I need to generate and handle Sessions in a different way, so that different  transactions to the same databases are handled in an orderly fashion and not interfere with each other. However, I lack some insight in how to make this work. Any help is greatly appreciated! </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> For one service method, when testing with more than one agent, the first dozen or so call work fine, and then the following string of exceptions start appearing that only pertain the auxiliary database: </p>

<ol>
<li>""There was a problem converting an IDataReader to NDataReader"" /
""Invalid attempt to call MetaData when reader is closed.""</li>
<li>""illegal access to loading collection"" </li>
<li>""Begin failed with SQL exception"" / ""Timeout expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding."" </li>
<li>""could not execute query"" / ""ExecuteReader requires an open and available Connection. The connection's current state is closed.""</li>
<li>""could not initialize a collection:"" / ""Timeout expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.""</li>
<li>""Transaction not successfully started"" </li>
<li>""The transaction is either not associated with the current connection or has been completed."" </li>
<li>""could not initialize a collection:"" / ""Invalid attempt to call Read when reader is closed."" </li>
</ol>

<p>Exception 1, at least, indicates that the same session is accessed by multiple threads (calls probably). Also the other ones indicate that the current session is interrupted by other processes. But how can this be, when I tried to isolate the calls and have them queued up? </p>

<p>For another service method, these issues do not appear with the auxiliary database, but after some time I start getting the ZombiedTransaction exceptions (deadlocks) with transactions to the legacy databases. Still... What gives?  </p>

<p>the basic concept is, I want to use doselect to control whether pass the texture or not. means, if doselect is true, then pass a texture handle to variable tex, if doselect is false, no texture is needed. But it don't work as I expected, the above mentioned error will pop-up. I did several experiments:
1. define doselect as local variable, no error. - I guess this code snipper may be oprimized by the compiler.</p>

<pre><code>float4 PS(PS_INPUT in, in uint primId: SV_PrimitiveID) : SV_TARGET

Everything is good with object and action creation and posting, but one thing — I can't figure out how to pass GeoPoint property to object and make it to be presented on the map.</p>

<p>I was trying two approaches: </p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>Inheriting Place object and using pre-defined ""place:location"" property like this:</strong></p>

<pre><code>NSMutableDictionary&lt;FBOpenGraphObject&gt; *object = [FBGraphObject openGraphObjectForPost];
object.provisionedForPost = YES;
// ...
// other properties work perfect
// ...
object[@""place""] = @{ @""location"" : @{ @""longitude"": @(-58.381667), @""latitude"":@(-34.603333)} };
</code></pre>

<p>This way it just doesn't pass value, in <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/tools/object-browser"" rel=""nofollow"">Object Browser</a> <strong>""place:location""</strong> field is empty. Although, if I hardcode it, map appears in post and it looks like exactly what I need.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> <strong>Creating custom GeoPoint property ""location"" and trying to pass the same value there:</strong></p>

<pre><code>NSMutableDictionary&lt;FBOpenGraphObject&gt; *object = [FBGraphObject openGraphObjectForPost];
object.provisionedForPost = YES;
// ...
// other properties work perfect
// ...
object[@""data""] = @{
                    @""location"": @{
                        @""latitude"": latitude, // these are NSNumber objects, but i also
                        @""longitude"": longitude // tried to pass NSString objects
                       }
                   };
</code></pre>

<p>This way value is passed and value for <strong>""myapp_namespace:location""</strong> property appears in Object Browser, but Story just ignores it for some reason and map doesn't show. </p>

<p>In both cases, I went to Story attachments settings and selected Map layout, as well as chose appropriate property as a Highlighted Point. I just can't get why it doesn't accept value in first case and totally ignores value in the second case. I'd appreciate any help with this question and I  think it may be useful for community since I really can't found answer for many hours.</p>

<p>The best solution that I can think of is to have Users select a variable class (ex. Customer.age) from a select dropdown and then have a form where they can manually type in rules in a predefined structure. The following will be examples of acceptable inputs (for the Customer.age example):</p>

<pre><code>&lt; 18 THEN ""escalate""
&gt; 25 THEN ""accept""
&gt; 65 THEN ""reject""
IN [20, 21 , 22] THEN ""congratulate""
BETWEEN [30, 40] THEN ""revert""
</code></pre>

<p>The input structure obviously needs to adhere to strict validation rules. I see the structure working as #{OPERATOR} #{VALUE} THEN #{RESULT}. The value can obviously be an array, the others will obviously always be singular. Some rules that need to hold true are:</p>

<pre><code>1. String has correct format
2. First param is all uppercase 
3. First param is a Valid operator
4. second param is a valid value / Array with valid values enclosed in square brackets.
5. Third Param is always ""THEN""
6. Fourth param is in valid list.
</code></pre>

<p>What is the best way to approach this? Will it be REGEX? Or is there a different view on implementing this type of solution?</p>

<p>I don't mind making this system (validations) very strict as 3rd Party Admin will receive thorough training and documentation on the system.</p>
