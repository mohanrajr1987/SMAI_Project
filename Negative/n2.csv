<p>I went through a ton of tutorials on product grids and adding custom tabs, but I cannot figure out how to add a product grid with multiselect functionality to a custom tab on the customer edit adminpage.</p>

<p>It seems to me that most tutorials add the tab like <a href=""http://mydons.com/how-to-add-custom-tabs-to-magento-customer-edit-page/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;layout version=""0.1.0""&gt;
    &lt;adminhtml_customer_edit&gt;
        &lt;reference name=""customer_edit_tabs""&gt;
            &lt;action method=""addTab""&gt;&lt;name&gt;customer_edit_tab_action&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;block&gt;customertab/adminhtml_customer_edit_tab_action&lt;/block&gt;&lt;/action&gt;
        &lt;/reference&gt;
    &lt;/adminhtml_customer_edit&gt;
&lt;/layout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But you end up with a Action.php file which extends <code>Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Template</code> which sets a template file <code>$this-&gt;setTemplate('customertab/action.phtml');</code> and that is not how the product grid is added.</p>

<p>The product grid, or more specifically the grid serializer, is added like <a href=""http://magebase.com/magento-tutorials/understanding-the-grid-serializer-block/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;adminhtml_catalog_product_upsell&gt;
&lt;block type=""core/text_list"" name=""root""&gt;
    &lt;block type=""adminhtml/catalog_product_edit_tab_upsell"" name=""catalog.product.edit.tab.upsell""/&gt;
    &lt;block type=""adminhtml/widget_grid_serializer"" name=""upsell_grid_serializer""&gt;
        &lt;reference name=""upsell_grid_serializer""&gt;
            &lt;action method=""initSerializerBlock""&gt;
                &lt;grid_block_name&gt;catalog.product.edit.tab.upsell&lt;/grid_block_name&gt;
                &lt;data_callback&gt;getSelectedUpsellProducts&lt;/data_callback&gt;
                &lt;hidden_input_name&gt;links[upsell]&lt;/hidden_input_name&gt;
                &lt;reload_param_name&gt;products_upsell&lt;/reload_param_name&gt;
            &lt;/action&gt;
            &lt;action method=""addColumnInputName""&gt;
                &lt;input_name&gt;position&lt;/input_name&gt;
            &lt;/action&gt;
        &lt;/reference&gt;
    &lt;/block&gt;
&lt;/block&gt;
&lt;/adminhtml_catalog_product_upsell&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Although this is a core example the tutorials also use this with their own tags instead of <code>adminhtml_catalog_product_upsell</code>. So I've tried to add this to <code>adminhtml_customer_edit</code> in a few ways but that does not seem to work. Sometimes it adds the blocks directly on the page instead of a new tab, other times it's just not showing up at all and the functionality would never work.</p>

<p>I have looked into the Ultimate Module Creator and examples like <a href=""http://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/13305/how-to-create-the-product-grid-serializer-block-in-custom-module"">this</a> but I'm not sure if all that is needed, besides I'm not sure how to make the connection between products and customers there either.</p>

<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction ie with a good tutorial and the changes I have to make to get it working as a tab in the customer edit pages?</p>

<p>The wierd thing is if I do the edit without an ID (to create a contract it's working perfectly, it's only when I find a match... </p>

<p>I don't know if this is correct :</p>

<pre><code>    $contract = $repository-&gt;findBy(
        array('id' =&gt; $id),
        array('end' =&gt; 'ASC'));
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesnt matter I tried with a simple one</p>

<pre><code>$contract = $em-&gt;getRepository('MyAppToolsBundle:Contract')-&gt;find($id);
</code></pre>

<p>I have the same error. I'm stuck and I really don't know why symfony thinks that the entity is my other Bundle and not in my toolsBundle...</p>

<li><p>getFolder is invoked more than once in the code.</p></li>

<p>I suppose it is possible that the connection to the mail server dies at some point after the folder.getMessages() from time to time, but it ALWAYS fails on the exist() call as opposed to the create() call. </p>

<p>One solution is to call store.isConnected() first and reconnect if required, but I want to figure out if there is something I am doing wrong first before I resort to that. </p>

<p>Or functions that are recursive and have memoization vs. dynamic programming where you iterate over an array and fill in values, etc.</p>

<p>I know that sometimes recursion is bad because you can run out of memory (tail recursion?) with the heap (or stack?), but does any of this affect O notation?</p>

<p>Does a recursive memoized algorithm have the same O notation / speed as the iterative version? </p>

<p>Here is the code, note the difference between the video and story part of it, I didn't convert the video part yet it is the fully-working original code. Also, PHP thinks that the serial code is a filepath, why is that? The code is simply a 10 digit series of letters and numbers two sets of 5 digits with a dash between to simplify reading it.</p>

<pre><code>let incomingRequest: CFHTTPMessageRef? = CFDictionaryGetValue(self.incomingRequests as CFMutableDictionaryRef, unsafeAddressOf(incomingFileHandle!)) as CFHTTPMessageRef
</code></pre>

<p>The code above gives the error message: <code>'UnsafePointer&lt;Void&gt;' is not convertible to 'CFHTTPMessageRef'</code></p>

<p>I guess what I don't understand is how do I convert an 'UnsafePointer' returned by a Core Foundation function to the pointer type it should be (i.e. CFHTTPMessageRef in this case). How do I find documentation on how to do this. I've read everything I can find, but nothing so far explains how to recast return values to what they should have been in the first place. This has to be documented somewhere, doesn't it?</p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>Here's the code I'm having trouble with:</p>

<pre><code>let incomingRequest = CFDictionaryGetValue(self.incomingRequests as CFMutableDictionaryRef, unsafeAddressOf(incomingFileHandle!))
        unsafeBitCast(incomingRequest, CFHTTPMessageRef.self)
if (incomingRequest != nil) {
let success: Boolean = CFHTTPMessageAppendBytes(incomingRequest as CFHTTPMessageRef, unsafeAddressOf(data!.bytes) as UnsafePointer&lt;UInt8&gt;, data!.length)
if success { // Do something... }
</code></pre>

<p>The CFHTTPMessageAppendBytes call still gives a ""Type 'UnsafePointer' does not conform to protocol 'AnyObject'"". And the following 'if' check for 'success' complains that ""Type 'Boolean' doesn not conform to protocol 'BooleanType'"". What the heck is that about? Boolean isn't a Boolean type?</p>

<p>I find the strict type checking of Swift extremely frustrating. So far it is far more difficult to code in than Obj-C, C, or any of the other languages I've used. I'm sure it's because I just don't get it, or haven't found the right documentation, but this is really driving me crazy.</p>

  <p>ASP.NET pages are supposed to work.
  What is happening over here is that
  when you click on open_com button, the
  ASP.NET page posts back to itself,
  executes the event handler i.e., opens
  the port. Then when the page finishes
  processing the post back, it is
  unloaded. At this point the COM1

I'm thinking something inspired by Spring.NET for example, where you configure your object graphs in structured database tables, rather than using an XML config file.  What would be the pros and cons of configuring your application in the database rather than an XML file?</p>

<p>I guess it is because the code from the book is written for the earlier SDK version so I tried to use SensorEventListener instead.</p>

<p>Then when I tried to register the listener</p>

<pre><code>sensorManager.registerListener(sensorListener, SensorManager.SENSOR_ORIENTATION, SensorManager.SENSOR_DELAY_FASTEST);
</code></pre>

<p>an error appeared:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The method registerListener(SensorListener, int, int) in the type SensorManager is not applicable for the arguments (SensorEventListener, int, int)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so I tried to cast SensorEventListener to SensorListener, but the application doesn't work.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to use sensor in newer SDK versions?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>i got few answers from few people</h2>

<p>1) ts beacuse of the scope of of the protected access modifier, as we know,A protected member is accessible from within the class in which it is declared, and from within any class derived from the class that declared this member.and we know that every .net control is internally a class.
A protected member of a base class is accessible in a derived class only if the access takes place through the derived class type. </p>

<p>2) It is protected due to inheritence between code behind and the aspx.cs file. If you dont want it to be inherited you can make it private or sealed </p>

<p>3) i think u point toward right direction....would u plzz come with a sample code just to show the relation between aspx and code behind and the usage of protected modifier which is important.</p>

<p>no answer gave in detail. so please tell me in detail what kind of relation is there as a result any control's access modifier is protected?</p>

<p>I need to add functionality to Suspend any one of these roles (or all of them).</p>

<p>I guess I can either:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To the existing table, I can add a new boolean column for each existing role column. e.g. <code>role1_suspended</code>, <code>role2_suspended</code> etc</p></li>
<li><p>Create table called <code>mpb_suspensions</code>, with 2 columns: <code>mpb_item_id</code> and <code>role_name</code>.  Since the roles don't have ids themselves, the role_name column will store 'role1', or 'role2' etc depending on which role was suspended.</p></li>

<p>Is there any way that I can avoid using two jsp for refreshing and refresh the jsp on the same main jsp itself? </p>

<p>This fails, however, when the user puts a space in the string they are searching for, since I'm using jQuery to split the document text into Nodes, and checking if each one contains the current search phrase.</p>

<p>What I would like to be able to do is to expand this to search for a user-defined string, instead of failing after the first space. I'm not sure how to do this at all, though, so I was hoping someone could help me out here.</p>

<p>Here's what I'm currently working with, to find the nodes:</p>

<pre><code>keyup(function({

    $(instance.textWrapper).html(instance.getOriginalText());               

    if (this.value.length &gt;= instance.startSearchingLength) {

        var regx = new RegExp(""("" + escape(this.value) + "")"", 'gi');

        $(instance.textWrapper).each(function() {
            var textNodes = $(this).find('*').contents().filter(function(){
                return this.nodeType === 3
        });

        textNodes.each(function(){
            var $this = $(this);
            var content = $this.text();
            content = content.replace(regx, 
                                      '&lt;span class=""'
                                      + instance.highlightCssClass +
                                      '""&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;');
            $this.replaceWith(content);     
        });
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>startSearchingLength</code> is defined earlier as the length the search must be to be searched.
<code>highlightCssClass</code> is just what to the CSS class to wrap the string in once it is found.</p>

<p>Example of failure:</p>

<p>Searching for <code>foo bar</code> will highlight each instance of <code>foo</code> on the page, but as soon as the space is encountered, those highlights go away and the full string cannot be found.</p>

<p>So, the code currently searches each individual <code>Text Node</code> for the search query, but I'm hoping to make the script find any string in all of the text of the file. I have no idea how to do this, so any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

I have this allowed function on a controller:</p>

<pre><code>public function getUserAvatar($id){ 
     echo ""Hello"";
     $var = this-&gt;Url-&gt;hello();
     echo ""bye"";
     echo $var;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And at the Url component i have this function:</p>

<pre><code>public function hello(){
     return ""component"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>I dont know why, it prints ""Hello"" and it stops there. 
It doesn't print ""bye"" and either ""var;</p>

<p>What can be happening? I am getting crazy!!</p>

<h2>UPDATE:</h2>

<p>Now i realice this has been happening to me <strong>always</strong> when i call a controller from another controller and that 2nd controller calls a component.
Something like this:</p>

<p><strong>Controller1</strong></p>

<pre><code> public function test(){
        $controller2 = new Controller2();
        $data = $controller2-&gt;getUserAvatar();
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Controller2</strong></p>

<pre><code>var $components = array('Component1');

public function getUserAvatar(){
   $this-&gt;Component1-&gt;sayHi();
   echo ""bye"";
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Component1</strong></p>

<pre><code>public function sayHi(){
     return ""hi"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>In order to avoid it, i have to use a requestAction call, something like:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;requestAction(array('controller' =&gt; 'controller1', 'action' =&gt; 'test'));
</code></pre>

<p>So... what am i doing wrong? Thanks.</p>

The problem arises when I want to plot the data in ggplot. I know I have to extract the right data from the list I've created, but which and how? The dataset I've been practicing on can be downloaded here <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1PQGov60aoudVR3dVZBX1VKaHc/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1PQGov60aoudVR3dVZBX1VKaHc/view?usp=sharing</a>
The code I've been using to get the data transformed is this:</p>

<pre><code>library(vegan)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(grid)
data &lt;- read.csv(file = ""People.csv"", header = T, sep = "","", dec = ""."", check.names = F, na.strings=c(""NA"", ""-"", ""?""))
data2 &lt;- data[,-1]
rownames(data2) &lt;- data[,1]
data2 &lt;- scale(data2, center = T, scale = apply(data2, 2, sd))
data2.pca &lt;- rda(data2)
</code></pre>

<p>Which gives me a list I can plot using the basic ""plot"" and ""biplot"" function, but I am at a loss as to how to plot both PCA and biplot in ggplot. I would also like to color the data points by group, e.g. sex. Any help would be great.</p>

<p>for some reason, all the datetime fields have <strong>''</strong> and thus causes error in update.</p>

<p>Edit:
C# code, BAL</p>

<pre><code>public int Update(int _id, ProductManager _M)
{
    int result = _M.Product.UpdateByID(_id, _M.Product);

    return result;

}
</code></pre>

<p>C# code, DAL</p>

<pre><code>public virtual int UpdateByID(int _id, db_Product data)

    data.DateUpdate = DateTime.Now;
     using (var db = new ConnClass().ConnDB())
     {

         return result;
     }
}

<p>The BAL <strong>_M.Product.UpdateByID(_id, _M.Product);</strong> send the update to the DAL code for update.
I checked the values in my <strong>ProductManager _M</strong>, the dateTime Values are valid. </p>

<p>ODAC should be the latest, I just pulled it 3 days ago, but the versions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Oracle.DataAccess.dll version 2.112.3.0 (release 5)</li>
<li>oci.dll (instant client) version 11.2.0.1</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a Table, People, that has 3 columns:</p>

<ul>
<li>ID</li>
<li>FirstName</li>
<li>LastName</li>
</ul>

<p>In code I run an ALTER TABLE command, using <code>OracleCommand.ExecuteNonQuery</code>, to add a new column named ""MIDDLE_NAME"" to the table.  That command succeeds.  If I look at the table with Oracle SQL Developer, the columns shows up.  All well and good.</p>

<p>Now if I run use <code>OracleCommand.ExecuteReader</code> with a command text of <code>SELECT * FROM People</code> right after I do the alter table, I get back data with <strong>only 3 columns</strong>, not 4!</p>

<p>I've tried some things to prevent the behavior, and none of them give me back the 4th column:</p>

<ul>
<li>I close the connection and re-open it</li>
<li>I use a new <code>OracleConnection</code> for the <code>SELECT</code> than for the <code>ALTER</code></li>
<li>I use the same <code>OracleConnection</code> for the <code>SELECT</code> and for the <code>ALTER</code></li>
<li>I use a new <code>OracleCommand</code> for the <code>SELECT</code> than for the <code>ALTER</code></li>
<li>I use the same <code>OracleCommand</code> for the <code>SELECT</code> and for the <code>ALTER</code></li>
<li>I call <code>PurgeStatementCache</code> on the connection between the <code>ALTER</code> and <code>SELECT</code></li>
<li>I call <code>FlushCache</code> on the connection between the <code>ALTER</code> and <code>SELECT</code></li>
<li>I explicitly <code>Close</code> and <code>Dispose</code> the <code>OracleCommand</code> and <code>OracleConnection</code> (as opposed to the using block) used for the <code>ALTER</code> and <code>SELECT</code></li>
<li>Restarted the calling PC and the PC hosting the Oracle database.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I look at the column list by doing a <code>SELECT * FROM all_tab_cols</code>, the new column is there.</p>

<p>The only thing that seems to work reliably is closing the app and re-starting it (well it's from a unit test, but it's a shutdown and restart of the test host).  Then I get that 4th column.  Sometimes I can use breakpoints and re-execute queries and the 4th column will appear, but nothing that is specifically repeatable with straight execution of code (meaning without setting a break point and moving the execution point back up).</p>

<p>Something in the bowels of ODAC seems to be caching the schema of that table, but I can figure out what, why or how to prevent it.  Anyone have any experience with this, or ideas how I might prevent it?</p>

<p>In this sample, the only difference is that the buttons are in the body div instead of the footer div. In this case, the button click handlers <em>do</em> fire, but the buttons aren't positioned correctly and the UI looks dreadful.</p>

<p>In the dialog sample on the Durandal website there is an ""ok"" handler that is bound to both form submit and button click, as in the sample views here. It took me ages to figure out that it wasn't the button click event firing but the form submit event.</p>

<p>I need to put the buttons in the footer for proper layout, but I need the click events to fire so that I know whether the user clicked OK or Cancel. I can explicitly bind onclick=""commit"" and onclick=""rollback"" for the two buttons, but that's ... so hacky.</p>

I have designed an iOS to-do app which uses local notifications to alert users of a scheduled reminder (which they set in the app) . The app also uses the icon batch counter to display the # of tasks due ""today"".</p>

<p>At the time of a set reminder notifications correctly show up in Notification Center. However, once the app has been opened the notifications are cleared from Notification Center. The idea is that the notifications remain available in Notification Center until the user clears them.</p>

<p>I have discussed this with my developer and he states that notifications can only be saved in NC when we do not use the icon batch counter. This seems very illogical to me since the icon batch counter shows the # of tasks due ""today"" and the notifications shown in Notification Center are alerts set by the user.</p>

<p>Here's the code for the parent class with a rest parameter that works properly:</p>

<pre><code>package {
    import flash.events.MouseEvent;
    import flash.display.Stage;

public class SubClassText extends ClassText {
    protected var parentText:ClassText;
    protected var setStatValues;
    protected var className:String;
    protected var classType:int;

    public function SubClassText(textKey:String, textName:String, stageInstance:Stage, isVisible:Boolean, alignToObject:Object, direction:String, xDistance:Number, yDistance:Number, onOverText:String, parentText:ClassText, className:String, classType:int, ... setStatValues) {
        super(textKey, textName, stageInstance, isVisible, alignToObject, direction, xDistance, yDistance, onOverText);
        this.parentText = parentText;
        this.parentText.subClassArray.push(this);
        this.setStatValues = setStatValues;
        this.className = className;
        this.classType = classType;
    }

    //Called when the player clicks this object
    override protected function onClick(e:MouseEvent) {
        trace(this.setStatValues.length);
        Entity.getEntity(""entityName"", ""player"").setStat(""className"", this.className);
        Entity.getEntity(""entityName"", ""player"").setStat(""classType"", this.classType);

        for(var i:int = 0; i &lt; this.setStatValues.length; i++) {
            Entity.getEntity(""entityName"", ""player"").setStat(Main.statArray[i], this.setStatValues[i]);
        }
        Main.setClassVisibility(this.parentText.subClassArray, true);
    }

    //Adds this object to it's parent's class array
    override protected function addToArray() {
        Main.subClasses.push(this);
    }
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have the <code>trace()</code> call in the onClick listener to see the length of the rest parameter. In all instances of this class the rest parameter returns the proper amount of inputs (in this case, 5 since that's how many stats an entity has).</p>

<p>And here's the class that extends this parent class:</p>

<pre><code>package {
import flash.events.MouseEvent;
import flash.display.Stage;

public class AllySubClassText extends SubClassText {
    private var displayName:String;

    public function AllySubClassText(textKey:String, textName:String, stageInstance:Stage, isVisible:Boolean, alignToObject:Object, direction:String, xDistance:Number, yDistance:Number, onOverText:String, parentText:ClassText, displayName:String, className:String, classType:int, ... setStatValues) {
        super(textKey, textName, stageInstance, isVisible, alignToObject, direction, xDistance, yDistance, onOverText, parentText, className, classType, setStatValues);
        this.displayName = displayName;
    }

    //Called when the player clicks this object
    override protected function onClick(e:MouseEvent) {
        trace(this.setStatValues.length);
        Main.tryAddAlly(this.displayName, this.className, this.classType, this.setStatValues);
        Main.setAllyVisibility(this.parentText.subClassArray, true);
    }

    //Adds this object to it's parent's class array
    override protected function addToArray() {
        Main.allySubClasses.push(this);
    }
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I have the same rest parameter and the same <code>trace()</code> call.</p>

<p>For a better understanding here's an example piece of an instance of SubClassText:</p>

<pre><code>var beserker:SubClassText = new SubClassText(""beserker"", ""Beserker"", stage, false,
warrior, ""downCenter"", 0, 0, ""Beserkers are crazy strong fighters"", warrior, ""Beserker"", 
0, 15, 5, 10, 10, 10);
</code></pre>

<p>Then I can go into that SubClassText and trace its rest parameter length (setStatValues, I'm going to trace it from the fla document so for now I'm going to make that parameter <code>public</code> instead of <code>protected</code>):</p>

<pre><code>trace(beserker.setStatValues.length); //5
</code></pre>

<p>Now here's an example of an instance of AllySubClassText:</p>

<pre><code>var knight:AllySubClassText = new AllySubClassText(""knight"", ""War: The Knight"", 
stage, false, warriors, ""downCenter"", 0, 0, ""War is a strong Knight"", warriors, ""War"",
""Knight"", 0, 15, 5, 10, 10, 10);
</code></pre>

<p>Then when I trace the knight instance's rest parameter length:</p>

<pre><code>trace(knight.setStatValues.length); //1
</code></pre>

<p>The example pieces were taken directly from my code, I just shortened the onHover string so it's easier to read. Sorry for the huge amount of inputs on the classes, UI code quickly took a lot of parameters to work correctly. I'm not sure why all inputs are being treated as one index rather than individual indexes. I even know it's doing this because here's what happens when I trace just the rest parameter:</p>

<pre><code>trace(knight.setStatValues + "", "" + knight.setStatValues.length); //15,5,10,10,10, 1
</code></pre>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. It could be a minor oversight, but I'm stumped right now.</p>

<p>After that I tried to used that username and password (<strong>that was added as a member to ""guestbook"" _security</strong>) to get all the documents in the ""guestbook"" database. <strong>See code below:</strong></p>

<pre><code>   $scope.login = function(){
   var url = ""https://sub.iriscouch.com/guestbook/_all_docs"";

   $http({
    url: url,
    method: 'GET',
    params: {
        include_docs: true,

    },
    withCredentials: true,
    headers: {""Authorization"": auth_hash($scope.uname, $scope.upass)}
})

.success(function(data, status, headers, config){

    $scope.book = data.rows;
    console.log($scope.book);

});
}

function auth_hash(username, password)
{
     return ""Basic"" +btoa(username + "":"" + password);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>But everytime I tired access the ""_all_docs"" I get a 401 unauthorised error. The username I am using to access has been added as a member into the _security documents of the guestbook database.</strong></p>

<p>Can anyone help. What am I doing wrong.</p>

The problem of multiline text renderer is not new and I've already faced it in other post(for example this <a href=""http://blog.botunge.dk/post/2009/10/09/JTable-multiline-cell-renderer.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.botunge.dk/post/2009/10/09/JTable-multiline-cell-renderer.aspx</a>). But in this problem the table is static, the number of rows is fixed at first and it remains the same. In my project the initial number of rows are one and editing a query in cell (0,0) the table should update by showing in new rows the list of articles(with title, content, data and link to the article).
Here's the code of main class:</p>

# Create U

U, s, V = np.linalg.svd(M)
U = U[:, :5]
U.T * U

<p><code>A</code> is not a symmetric matrix. </p>

<p>Besides, I checked <code>np.all(U.T*U == (U.T*U).T)</code> would be <code>False</code>. </p>

<p>Is this the reason that my <code>A</code> matrix is not symmetric? In other words, is this a numerical issue one cannot avoid? </p>

<p>In practice, how would one avoid this kind of issue and get a symmetric matrix <code>A</code>?</p>

<p>I used the trick <code>A = (A + A.T)/2</code> to force it to be symmetric. Is this a good way to get around this problem?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Since I'm not specifying what algorithm I want, it uses SHA256.</p>

<p>Now, I try to verify this in c#. That didn't turn out easy...</p>

<p>I get an exception about the key size:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IDX10603: The 'System.IdentityModel.Tokens.InMemorySymmetricSecurityKey' cannot have less than: '128' bits.
  Parameternavn: key.KeySize
  The actual size was 48.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I I try to extend the key, I get a new error when creating the symmetric key:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Invalid length for a Base-64 char array or string</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I recon this has something to do with the way I'm telling the .net code about my key. Since the <code>SymmetricKeyIssuerSecurityTokenProvider</code> constructor parameter is named <code>base64Key</code>, I have tryed to Base64Url-encode my key:</p>

<pre><code>        var secret =  Base64UrlEncoder.Encode(""secret"");
        TokenValidationParameters validationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
        {                
            ValidateIssuer = false,
            ValidateAudience = false,
            IssuerSigningTokens = new SymmetricKeyIssuerSecurityTokenProvider(issuer, secret).SecurityTokens
        };

<p><strong>So, what are I missing here?<br>
Why can <code>jsonwebtoken</code> generate and validate jots with short keys while .net can not?<br>
And why can't .net accept the keys I give it?</strong></p>

<p>Here's the complete .net code with a jot signed with a long key:</p>

<p>I am building a fairly complex application using Python and PySide. Finally the day of the release is nearing so I want to build this application as an exe. I am using PyInstaller to build my exe binary.</p>

<p>A part of this application loads some JPEG images. I had problems loading these images into my application (they just wouldn't show up), so I had to do this:</p>

<pre><code>path = os.getcwd()
app.addLibraryPath(path) #app being QApplication()
</code></pre>

<p>This made it work (this path contains the <code>imageformats</code> folder which contains the <code>qjpeg4.dll</code> and other image loading plugins)</p>

<p>However, now I ran into the same problem when packaging it with PyInstaller. I must use the <code>--onefile</code> flag, but even when I don't, I can see that PyInstaller did not include the <code>imageformats</code> folder - nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>I know that this is the problem because when I manually copy/paste the imageformats folder into the folder where the exe is located, the application works as expected.</p>

<p>Is there a way to <em>force</em> PyInstaller to include a folder I specify, specifically this imageformats folder?</p>

<p>The solution to that question modified a tiny bit:</p>

<pre><code>(?&lt;=\#)(.*?)(?=\#)
</code></pre>

<p>Given a string ""The #iPhone 4# is made by #apple#."" that solution returns:</p>

<p>[""iPhone 4"", "" is made by "", ""apple""]</p>

<p>Now I'm not sure if this is possible using only a regex, but in this case "" is made by "" is not supposed to be returned. It simply happens to be squashed between the other two ## wrapped strings, and so is wrapped itself.</p>

<p>Clarification: The regex needs to support a variable number of #foo# strings in the parent string. There will not always be only 2.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Due to the varied responses, and the realization that this problem is more simply solved without regex, I'm voting to close the question. Answer: do this without regex, in the language of your choice.</p>

<p>Naturally, this does not compile, and neither does declaring it as a const unsigned int inside the class. How would one do this elegantly?</p>

figure img:hover + figcaption {

</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that perspective does not give the same render for Chrome and Firefox.
I had to set manually the figcaption default transform to <code>rotateX(-123deg);</code> depending of the perspective value which is 500px, and it works well on Chrome, but not on Firefox.</p>

<p>Theoretically, it should be -90deg when not :hover and 0deg when :hover, but seems that the <code>perspective</code> attribute changes the length of the depth field and so -90deg does not works anymore.</p>

<p>I wonder what are the best practices when playing with <code>perspective</code> and <code>rotate</code> in order to make it works well on all recent browsers ?</p>

<p>Best regards.</p>

<p>So above are my complete project structure and code files, but my actual problem is <code>new-styles.css</code> file is not working, even though i had written some css code in the file it is not linking to the template, so can anyone please let me know whats wrong and why <code>base.html</code>  template file is unable to access the <code>new-styles.css</code> file, whether the path given in <code>link</code>  tag is wrong or the path setting in the <code>settings.py</code> is wrong ?</p>

appears only at windows(tried in windows 7 and 8 with with MSVC2012_OpenGL_32bit). Here is example:</p>

<p>In main.cpp at begin i print:</p>

<pre><code>QTime time = QTime::currentTime();
qsrand((uint)time.msec());
</code></pre>

<p>then in loop i use qrand</p>

<pre><code>for (int j = 0; j &lt; 4; j++)
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++)
    {
        int r1 = qrand() % 150;
        int r2 = qrand() % 150;
        qDebug() &lt;&lt; r1 &lt;&lt; r2 &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>in output there are 2 different numbers repeats about 200 times, then changes:</p>

<pre><code>8 58
8 58
8 58
...
120 1
120 1
120 1
...
</code></pre>

<p>if i use qrand not in loop, it works right. But, if i make function, that generates random numbers with qrand this function works wrong.
In linux on gcc 64 bit compiler the same code works right, it generates different numbers in every line.
In windows 7 and 8 with MSVC2012_OpenGL_32bit qrand works wrong. Also, i tried standard srand and rand(), it also works wrong. I checked (uint)time.msec(), it is always different.
But if i put qsrand into loop program generates not perfect, but different numbers:</p>

<pre><code>for (int j = 0; j &lt; 4; j++)
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++)
    {
        QTime time = QTime::currentTime();
        qsrand((uint)time.msec());
        int r1 = qrand() % 150;
        int r2 = qrand() % 150;
        qDebug() &lt;&lt; r1 &lt;&lt; r2 &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output not perfect couse it qrand just generates different numbers more often, but again not always.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
i tried c++11 random in windows and it works. I didn't try it in linux yet. But the question about qrand is still alive.</p>

<p>The c++11 random which i used:

<p>I have a GridControl bound to a BindingList. At first what I was doing was creating a worker thread and access the BindingList directly, but this was throwing a ""Cross-thread operation detected"", so I followed the guide here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/AK2981.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/AK2981.aspx</a></p>

<p>My guess is that the GridView is still listening to the INotifyPropertyChanged from the object.</p>

<p>How can I fix this?</p>

Also suppose that subnet 1 is required to support up to 125 different hosts, and subnets 2 and 3 are each required to support up to 60 different hosts.</p>

The program fairly constantly writes out some ascii data from the main machine, which is then received by the remote machine. The process goes fairly nicely (though not without some unwanted choppiness, but that's not what this question is about). </p>

<p>It goes nicely, that is, until I switch forms. The application has three main forms. When forms are switched, the old form is hidden and the new one is shown. The user uses the <code>[X]</code> toolbar button on form2 or form3 to close those forms and return to form1 (not my design decision. The project is based on a VB6 application and I haven't gotten much leeway to change its functionality).</p>

<p>When I go from form1 to form2, the serialPort suddenly starts reporting that it's closed. But... it continues to send data. That is, until I switch back to form1, at which point I get an <code>InvalidOperationException</code> telling me that the serialPort is closed, and can't write. The serialPort object is private, and form1 is the only form that touches it. </p>

<p>Just to be sure that was I wasn't going through and closing it somewhere on accident, I commented out every single <code>serialPort.Close();</code> line in the project, and I'm still getting the same error. Something is causing the port to close (or report that it's closed) and i have no idea what. Furthermore, I can't open it back up, because it tells me that the port is currently in use.</p>

<p>I don't really know anything about BlueTooth or networking, so this is all the result of me bumbling around with little more than Google at my side. Maybe someone here knows the nuances of the SerialPort class enough to know what I'm doing wrong.</p>

<p>Here the Layout of the fragment that has to be switched to at the beginning:
<code>fragment_position.xml</code>:</p>

<p>If I want to start my app, I get an NullPointerException in this Line:</p>

<pre><code>map = ((SupportMapFragment) getFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.map)).getMap();
</code></pre>

<p>I think the problem is in the <code>activity_main.xml</code> or the <code>fragment_position.xml</code>.</p>

<p>If I want to start an other fragment (no map) it runs perfectly.</p>

The database was created with the concept of inheritance, where there is a parent table and several child tables who inherit their properties. To facilitate querys with INNER JOIN, all child tables contained only reference to the identification of the parent table (foreign keys that were at the same time are primary keys). Follows the model:</p>

<pre><code>BaseDocument
{
    Id : Long

}

AdministrativeDocument

    Id : Long (PK), (FK : BaseDocument(Id))

Maybe I am missing something obvious.  I am able to make this work with a separate file (different filename) that uses class_eval, but I am not really happy with that solution.  Any ideas on an elegant solution for this?</p>

<p>I am also wondering if there is a reason behind this restriction, or is it just a result of how rails loads files (see included link) and not intentional.  It seems to me that changing the load behavior of engines to allow reopening classes in this manner would be a good feature in rails.  I know it confused me at first, and I am sure other developers will struggle with this problem as well.</p>

<p>When working with arrays, say you want to create a new integer array size <code>3</code>, it would look like this:</p>

<p><code>int[] newArray = new int[3] {1, 2, 3};</code></p>

<p>Totally find and readable... Right?</p>

<p>The standard with programming languages seem to dictate that the ""first"" index is <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>Using that logic, if I am interested in creating an array the size <code>3</code>, I should really be writing this:</p>

<p><code>int[] newArray = new int[2] {1, 2, 3};</code></p>

<p>Wait a minute.. VS is throwing an error, saying <code>an array initialize of length 2 is expected</code>.</p>

<p>So there's an inconsistency with the first index in looping through an array and the array-size declaration? The former uses a <code>0</code>-th based index, and the second a <code>1</code>-th index.</p>

<p>It's not game-breaking/changing in any form or way, but I'm genuinely curious why there's a discrepancy here, or hell, if this is even an issue at all (like I say, it's not game-breaking in any way, but I'm curious as to why it's done this way).</p>

<p>I can at the moment think of reasons why <code>1</code>-th based index would be used:</p>

<p>In a for-loop you would use <code>&lt; newArray.Length</code> as opposed to <code>&lt; newArray.Length - 1</code> or <code>&lt; newArray.Length</code>.</p>

<p>Working with <code>List</code>s for awhile and then coming back to size-needs-to-be-declared-arrays caught me a bit off-guard.</p>

But the project uses Subversion and some of the files contain svn keywords.  For example in the Java class JavaDocs:</p>

<pre><code>/**

<p>The patches I've created don't seem to recognize these as keywords - the keyword substitutions are picked up as changes and appear in the patch, for example:</p>

<pre><code>- * @version $Id: Example.java 5930 2014-01-03 14:34:42Z rlaidlaw $
+ * @version $Id: Example.java 5930 2014-01-03 14:34:43Z rlaidlaw $

<p>I think this is because the patches are created using a standard diff tool rather than svn diff.  Is there a way that I can create a patch in IntelliJ using svn diff instead?  I've looked on the Subversion menu but can't find anything there.  Obviously I can do it from the command line but it would be great to use IntelliJ instead.</p>

<p>I'm using IntelliJ IDEA 13 Community Edition, which has built-in support for Subversion.  I haven't installed any other Subversion plugins.</p>

<p>You'll notice immediately, that some things are wrong:</p>

<ol>
<li>the mimetype is delcared as <code>application/octect-stream</code>. This indicates the actual mimetype was unable to be resolved. </li>
<li>The file size is <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>The error is <code>1</code>.</li>

My requirements were like that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Access to active object shall be serialized by executing its methods
within its own thread (main req and assumption of Active Object
design pattern)</li>
<li>Caller shall be able to specify the priority of requests execution. It means that if there is more than zero requests waiting for execution, they shall be ordered by the priority assigned to each request. Requests with higher priority shall be executed first so if there will be some requests pending on the ActivationList always and they will have higher priority than a given requests, this request will never be executed - its OK for me</li>
<li>It shall be possible to specify the maximum number of requests pending on the list (limit the memory usage)</li>
<li>It shall be possible to invalidate all pending requests</li>
<li>Requests shall be able to return values (blocking the caller) OR just shall be executed without value return but caller shall be blocked until request is processed OR caller shall not be blocked and it is not important for it if given request has been processed or not
g</li>
<li>Just before request execution, some guard method shall be executed to check if given request shall be executed or not. If not - it shall return some undefined value to caller (in my current implementation it is boost::none, because each request return type is boost::optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>OK now question:
Is it possible to use boost::asio and fulfill all my requirements? My implementation is working but I would like to use something what is probably implemented in much better way than I have done this. Also I would like to know it for the future and do not ""reinvent the wheel"" once again.</p>

Basically I'm running the same set of tests against the same interfaces, just with an integrated implementation instead of a mock implementation.  The mock DAL tests run fine, another DAL implementation which uses XML files runs fine (just expectedly slower).  The slowest of the three, the actual SQL implementation (slow because of the teardown/setup between each test), brings about this error.</p>

<p>There's no shortage of information online about threading and WaitHandles for custom code, but this is happening inside of a 3rd party tool.  Is there something I can do with OpenCover to fix this?  Some command line argument which explicitly directs the threading to allow these long-running tests?

<p>I have many large files that I would like to split according to the third field within each of them, I would like to keep the header in each of the sub-files, and save the created sub-files in new directories created from the root names of the files. </p>

<p>The initial files stored in the original directory are:</p>

<pre><code>Downloads/directory1/Levels_CHG_Lab_S_sample1.txt
Downloads/directory1/Levels_CHG_Lab_S_sample2.txt
Downloads/directory1/Levels_CHG_Lab_S_sample3.txt
</code></pre>

<p>and so on..</p>

<p>Each of these files have 200 columns, and column 3 contains values from 1 through 10.
I would like to split each of the files above based on the value of this column, and store the subfiles in subfolders, so for example sub-folder ""Downloads/directory1/sample1"" will contain 10 files (with the header line) derived by splitting the file Downloads/directory1/Levels_CHG_Lab_S_sample1.txt.</p>

<p>I have tried now many different steps for these steps, with no success.. I must be making this more complicated than it is since the code I have tried looks aweful… 
Here is the code I am trying to work from:</p>

<pre><code>FILES=Downloads/directory1/

for f in $FILES
  do
    # Create folder with root name by stripping file names
    fname=${echo $f | sed 's/.txt//;s/Levels_CHG_Lab_S_//'}
    echo ""Creating sub-directory [$fname]""
    mkdir ""$fname""

    # Save the header
    awk 'NR==1{print $0}' $f &gt; header

    # Split each file by third column
    echo ""Splitting file $f""
    awk  'NR&gt;1  {print $0 &gt; $3"".txt"" }' $f

    # Move newly created files in sub directory
    mv {1..10}.txt $fname  # I have no idea how to do specify the files just created

    # Loop through the sub-files to attach header row:
    for subfile in $fname
      do
       cat header $subfile &gt;&gt; tmp_file
       mv -f tmp_file $subfile
      done
done

<p>All these steps seem very complicated to me, I would very much appreciate if you could help me solve this in the right way. Thank you very much for your help.

Although this differs from the open sourced code: <a href=""http://opensource.apple.com/source/CommonCrypto/CommonCrypto-36064/Source/GladmanAES/ccNewGladman.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.apple.com/source/CommonCrypto/CommonCrypto-36064/Source/GladmanAES/ccNewGladman.c</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once is_valid() returns True, you can process the form submission
  safe in the knowledge that it conforms to the validation rules defined
  by your form. While you could access request.POST directly at this
  point, it is better to access form.cleaned_data. This data has not
  only been validated but will also be converted in to the relevant
  Python types for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For more context, say we have a modelform which has several fields such as a book's title, book's author, and a field which asks for a url. </p>

<p>The form conditions are: if the url field is empty, the user must provide the title and author. If the url field is given and nothing else, I would parse the html from the given url and extract the title and author automatically for the user. </p>

<p>In the case where I automatically grab the title and author from the url, what would be the best way to handle saving this data to the model, since the form would return an empty cleaned_data for author and title? I made sure the data parsed will conform to the validate rules I have in the model, but setting cleaned_data like this seems suspicious.</p>

<p>In modelform class:</p>

<pre><code>def save(self, commit = True, *args, **kwargs):
    parsed_title = ... # String returned by my html parsing function
    parsed_author = ... # String returned by my html parsing function
    self.cleaned_data['title'] = parsed_title
    self.cleaned_data['author'] = parsed_author
</code></pre>

<p><br/>
<br/></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks, I made it like so:</p>

<pre><code>def save(self, commit=True, *args, **kwargs):
     instance = super(BookInfoForm, self).save(commit=commit, *args, **kwargs)
     ....
     instance.title = parsed_title
     instance.author = parsed_author

     return instance
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bit off topic since you've already answered the original question, but the above code breaks some other part. Instead of saving the compiled info to  <code>http://..../media/books/&lt;id&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;id&gt;</code> is the book id, it saves it to <code>http://..../media/books/None</code>. </p>

<p>I have a add/edit function in my <code>views.py</code> that handles adding and editing:</p>

<pre><code>def insert_or_modify(request, id=None):
    if id is not None:
         book = BookModel.objects.get(pk=id)
    else:
         book = BookModel()

   if request.method == 'POST':
       form = BookInfoForm(request.POST, instance=book)
       if form.is_valid():
           form.save()

   ....

   return render_to_response(...)
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to make sure the id is present so that I won't get id=None? I guess more specifically, in the save() in the modelform, is there a way to create a new instance with an id if instance.id = None? Although I thought calling super(ModelForm, self).save(...) would do that for me?</p>

<p>When I looked up the help for INSERT in SQL Sever Management Studio, one of their examples showed using the ""Values"" syntax that I used (with groups of values in parentheses and separated by commas).  The help documentation I found in SQL Server Management Studio looks like it's for SQL Server 2008, so perhaps that's the reason that the insert doesn't work.  Either way, I can't figure out why it won't work.</p>

<p>I'm one of the developers of the <a href=""http://gc3pie.googlecode.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">GC3Pie</a> remote execution
framework.  GC3Pie can spin up VMs on Amazon EC2 and then connect to
them via SSH to execute commands.  Users specify a keypair (local
files) and remote keypair name, and GC3Pie will tell EC2 to authorize
the remote keypair for SSH access; if that keypair does not exist
(yet) on EC2, GC3Pie will create it by uploading the given local
public key.</p>

<p>We are using <a href=""https://github.com/boto/boto"" rel=""nofollow"">Boto</a> to interact with EC2, and <a href=""http://www.lag.net/paramiko/"" rel=""nofollow"">Paramiko</a> for the
SSH connections.</p>

<p>Creation of the remote keypair works fine:</p>

<pre><code># context: self._conn = boto.connect_ec2(...)

with open(os.path.expanduser(self.public_key)) as fd:
    key_material = fd.read()
    imported_key = self._conn.import_key_pair(
        self.keypair_name, key_material)
    gc3libs.log.info(
        ""Successfully imported key `%s` with fingerprint `%s`"", ...)
</code></pre>

<p>However, before connecting to the remote VM, we verify that the
fingerprints match (code slightly abridged for readability):</p>

<pre><code># context: self._conn = boto.connect_ec2(...)

keypairs = dict((k.name, k) for k in self._conn.get_all_key_pairs())
# ...
# `keyfile` is the path to the *private* SSH key
pkey = paramiko.RSAKey.from_private_key_file(keyfile)
# ...
localkey_fingerprint = str.join(
    ':', (i.encode('hex') for i in pkey.get_fingerprint()))
if localkey_fingerprint != keypairs[self.keypair_name].fingerprint:
    gc3libs.log.error(
        ""Keypair `%s` is present but has different fingerprint: "", ...)
</code></pre>

<p>This code used to work, but we haven't check it live for some time.
We have recently gotten a bug report stating that the keypair is
successfully uploaded, but then the fingerprints do not match.</p>

<p>Investigation by the reporting user shows that Paramiko appears to
compute the fingerprint like <code>ssh-keygen -lf $keyfile</code>, whereas Amazon's EC2
seems to run <code>openssl pkey -in $keyfile -pubout -outform DER | openssl md5 -c</code>.</p>

<p>I could not find any relevant Google hit, so I'm asking here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this a know issue?</li>
<li>Is it a version issue? (e.g. we should run Paramiko at least version X.Y.Z or Boto A.B.C?)</li>
<li>Are we missing some optional arguments in either the Paramiko or the Boto calls, that would influence how the fingerprints are computed?</li>
<li>Or is there any other known workaround?</li>
</ul>

Most of the implementations that we override it with are domain-centric, i.e. in model classes. I'm yet to see an implementation of <code>equals</code> in a factory class or something equivalent.</p>

<p>My conclusion is that it was primarily put in to support the Java Collection API, so that it could deal with any <code>Object</code>.  Else, it could have been left to be defined by specific domain designs.</p>

<p>PS: I know this thread may be more discussion oriented, but did not where else to get insight into this. I have tried to search far and wide for the answer to this, but always land up in discussions or explanations as to the difference between <code>==</code> and <code>equals</code> or the best practices of writing equals.</p>

When i was using with <code>WhiteSpacehandling = None</code> then out from 4 books records i was receiving only 2 (every second book). Solution i found was to use WhiteSpaceHandling set to <code>WhiteSpacehandling = All</code> - then i get 4 records because at the end of each line in xml is placed CR (carriage return) therefore reader is using it somehow to correctly take all the data from xml when parameter set to <code>WhiteSpacehandling = All</code>. Unfortunetly there is still problem when XML file data would be all in one line then even setting up <code>WhitespaceHandling to All</code> will not help and i would retreive every second book data (because no CR).

<p>I have an idea now why I haven't been able to reproduce this problem in a small piece of test code. In a small program, Python's garbage collector isn't very active. I believe the problem is that Python is collecting some objects that are only referenced in GObject. I think it's a regression involving <a href=""https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92955"" rel=""nofollow"">this bug</a>, or a new similar bug.</p>

<p>I figured this out because I encountered the same problem again, but with my own class (which has references only from GObject objects) -- this time the entire <strong>dict</strong> is getting wiped out on the object. Uf I use the code <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/13520054/182642"">here</a> to monitor one of the attributes that dissappears, it doesn't disappear! It seems the extra reference keeps the attributes around. That smells like a garbage collector problem. I confirmed this by having the object add itself to a global list during initialization... that also fixes the problem as it occurs now.</p>

<h2>Original Problem</h2>

<p>I am experiencing some bizarre behavior with a PyGTK GUI. I have an object which is consistently losing a large number of attributes. I am trying to determine if this is a bug in my code, the Python interpreter, or PyGTK.</p>

<p>I make no calls to <code>delattr()</code>. I have tried detecting if anything is calling the <code>__delattr__()</code> method of my object by overriding <code>__delattr__()</code> with code that always raises an exception. I am able to reproduce the event which causes the object to lose its attributes but the exception is never raised. I'm not sure of another way to find out what function calls (if any) are causing the object to lose attributes.</p>

<p>The object in question is working perfectly at all times up until it suddenly loses attributes I'm trying to access.</p>

<p>The attribute loss occurs consistently after performing some actions in the GUI that have nothing to do with the object that is losing attributes. I discovered it by accident; there may be other actions that cause the object to lose its attributes.</p>

<p>I have added <code>print id(self)</code> to the method which access the disappearing attribute. The id that is printed is the same before and after the attribute disappears.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to track down the source of this problem?</p>

<p><strong>Reference code below:</strong> <em>(Note: I will update this code if/when I come up with a simplified test case that reproduces the problem. Right now the total code required to reproduce the bug is too big to post here.)</em></p>

<p>Here is the class for my object which loses its attributes. This is obviously a minimized version of the real functional code, but I am using this for debugging and the problem still occurs.</p>

<p>It is a subclass of my custom <code>MenuBar</code> class.
Note that the <code>on_file_import__activate()</code> method is connected to the signal for the menu item by one of the parent classes.</p>

<pre><code>class FluidClassManagerWindowMenu(MenuBar):
    menu_items = [(""File"",(""Import"",))]

    def __init__(self, parent):
        # XXX: different name than self.parent to see if it stops disappearing 
        self._xxx_my_parent = parent
        MenuBar.__init__(self, parent)

    def __delattr__(self,attr):
        # XXX: trying to find the cause for lost attributes
        traceback.print_stack()

    def on_file_import__activate(self, widget=None, data=None):
        # XXX: this is the same before and after the attributes disappear
        print id(self)
        # XXX: print the list of attributes to see what disappears
        print dir(self)
        # XXX: this works until the _xxx_my_parent attribute disappears
        print self._xxx_my_parent
</code></pre>

<p>If you're curious, here is the complete source for my MenuBar class.  It is a <a href=""http://packages.python.org/pygtkhelpers/"" rel=""nofollow"">pygtkhelpers</a> <code>SlaveView</code>, which inherits from <code>GObject</code>. The pygtkhelpers delegate does the automagic signal connection to the <code>on_file_import__activate</code> method above.</p>

<pre><code>class MenuBar(pygtkhelpers.delegates.SlaveView):        
    def __init__(self, parent):
        SlaveView.__init__(self)
        self.parent = parent

    def create_ui(self):
        menu_bar = gtk.MenuBar()
        menu_bar.set_pack_direction(gtk.PACK_DIRECTION_LTR)

        for menu_name, items in self.menu_items:
            menu = gtk.Menu()
            submenu = gtk.MenuItem(menu_name)
            submenu.set_submenu(menu)
            for item_name in items:
                if not item_name:
                    menu.append(gtk.MenuItem())
                    continue
                menuitem = gtk.MenuItem(item_name)
                fixed_item_name = item_name.lower().replace(' ','_')
                fixed_menu_name = menu_name.lower().replace(' ','_')
                attr_name = '%s_%s' % (fixed_menu_name,fixed_item_name)
                # set an attribute like self.edit_vial_layout
                # so pygtkhelpers can find the widget to connect the signal from
                setattr(self,attr_name,menuitem)
                menu.append(menuitem)
            menu_bar.append(submenu)
        self.vbox = gtk.VBox()
        self.vbox.pack_start(menu_bar)
        self.vbox.show_all()
        self.widget.add(self.vbox)

<p><strong>List of attributes which disappear from the object</strong>:</p>

<p><code>'_model', '_props', '_toplevel', '_xxx_my_parent',  'file_import', 'parent', 'slaves', 'testtesttest', 'vbox', 'widget'</code></p>

<p>The attribute <code>parent</code> is what originally was disappearing; I tried assigning its value to <code>_xxx_my_parent</code> in
<code>ManagerWindowMenu.__init__()</code> but it disappears as well. I also added a new attribute in <code>MenuBar.__init__</code> that I never access, called <code>testtesttest</code>, and it disappears too.</p>

The dictionary entries themselves are loaded and stored in a class which houses the words in Japanese (potentially with multiple spellings), their phonetic pronunciation(s) and definitions in English as three Lists. </p>

<p>I originally had a tree structure with each node representing a character in a word. It was very fast but unfortunately used a lot of memory. The definition data itself is around 35meg, and the tree structure itself was around 130meg. Additionally, it also only allowed for looking up from Japanese -> English. Memory is a concern as apart from the need for additional indexes it is intended that a Windows Phone 7 version of the application will exist. The dictionary contains a 150,000 entries.</p>

<p>To sum up, this is what I need to do:
Store a list of definitions
Have three indexes into this list for Japanese, phonetic and English meanings.
Have lookups be fast (ideally less than 1 second)
Use as little memory as possible (the memory usage limit on Windows Phone 7 is 90meg)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'a\tb c\nd'.split()
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
</code></pre>

<p>But yesterday I ran across a string that used <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space"">ZERO WIDTH SPACE</a> between words as well. Having turned my new knowledge in a short <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8927463/javascript-strange-comparison-behaviour"">black magic</a> performance (among JavaScript folks), I would like to ask how to better split by all <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character"">whitespace characters</a>, since the <code>split</code> is not enough:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; u'a\u200bc d'.split()
[u'a\u200bc', u'd']
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPD1</strong></p>

<p>it seems the solution suggested by <code>sth</code> gererally works but depends on some OS settings or Python compilation options. It would be nice to know the reason for sure (and if the setting can be switched on in Windows).</p>

<p><strong>UPD2</strong>
<code>cptphil</code> found a great <a href=""http://bugs.python.org/issue13391"">link</a> that makes everything clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So I contacted the Unicode Technical Committee about the issue and received a promptly received a response back. They pointed that the ZWSP was, once upon a time considered white space but that was changed in Unicode 4.0.1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A quotation from <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/review/resolved-pri.html#pri21"">unicode site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Changing U+200B Zero Width Space from Zs to Cf (2003.10.27)</p>
  
  <p>There have been persistent problems with usage of the U+200B Zero Width Space (ZWSP). The function of this character is to allow a line break at positions where it normally would not be allowed, and is thus functionally a format character with a general category of Cf. This behavior is well documented in the Unicode Standard, and the character not considered a Whitespace character in the Unicode Character Database. However, for historical reasons the general category is still Zs (Space Separator), which causes the character to be misused. ZWSP is also the only Zs character that is not Whitespace. The general category can cause misinterpretation of rule D13 Base character as allowing ZWSP as a base for combining marks.</p>
  
  <p>The proposal is to change the general category of U+200B from Zs to Cf.</p>
  
  <p>Resolution: Closed. The general category of U+200B will be changed from Zs to Cf in Unicode version 4.0.1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The change was then reflected in Python. The result of <code>u'\u200B'.isspace()</code> in Python 2.5.4 and 2.6.5 is <code>True</code>, in Python 2.7.1 it is already <code>False</code>.</p>

<p>For other space characters regular <code>split</code> is enough:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; u'a\u200Ac'.split()
[u'a', u'c']
</code></pre>

<p>And if that is not enough for you, add characters one by one as <code>Gabi Purcaru</code> suggests below.</p>

<p>As you can see it asks user the book name, pages nos and price, but it so happens that when you run code in visual basic, it doesn not allow to type name for book b2 onwards while it allows user to type price and page no for the same book b[i], moving forward it prints a blank space for book name where it did not allow user to type the name.</p>

<p>I noticed that with default behavior, the cache can get very unreasonable very quickly.  Whether or not Android will clear out that cache when memory gets low, I'm not okay with my users seeing a 15MB news app when everything except the web cache is about 1MB.</p>

<p>However, I would love to use the cache to some extent.  I saw WebSettings#setAppCacheMaxSize() and it seemed like it was just the ticket.  </p>

<p>It doesn't seem like it does anything.  I hardcoded the following into a method that is called by my activity's onCreate(), before anything is loaded:</p>

<p><code>originalSourceWebView.getSettings().setAppCacheMaxSize(300*1024);</code> (I was using a larger, configurable value but dropped it lower to confirm my problem).</p>

<p>I blow right by 300KB without any fanfare, as shown by <code>settings-&gt;applications-&gt;manage applications-&gt;click on my app</code>.  I'm listening in WebChromeClient#onReachedAppMaxCacheSize for events, but that never seems to trigger.</p>

<p>Has anyone successfully used this?  Is there some different cache I should be trying to manage?  The docs seem pretty sparse.  I went into the android source but it just sends values off to native code, and I don't know how to delve into that.</p>

<p>My test environment is a nexus one on 2.2.2.  I know that I'll need to make the cache calls by reflection in order to support 1.5 and 1.6, but if I can't make this work, there will be no need.</p>

<p>Both excellent answers from Jarret and Ole, here is what I have gone with. One final question ""METHOD 02"" picks up a carriage return to a blank line at the bottom of the text file, returns it as a subString, which in turn gets converted to ""0"" can I set the NSCharacterSet to stop that, currently I just added a length check on the string.</p>

NSScanner *scanner;
NSArray *subStrings;
NSString *eachString;

scanner = [NSScanner scannerWithString:strBuffer];
while ([scanner scanInteger:&amp;intFromFile]) NSLog(@""%d"", intFromFile);


// METHOD 02 Output: 57 58 59 0
strBuffer = [NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:dataFile_IN encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:&amp;fileError];
subStrings = [strBuffer componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet:[NSCharacterSet whitespaceAndNewlineCharacterSet]];

However the issue can also be observed in the default image gallery demo here: <a href=""http://www.jssor.com/demos/image-gallery.html"" rel=""nofollow"">JSSOR slider: Image Gallery Demo</a>.</p>

<p>What happens is the following.</p>

<p><strong>Desktop:</strong> When the mouse enters the thumbnail navigator the slideshow pauses and the hover image <code>t01.png</code> is being shown alongside the arrow navigators.</p>

<p>When the mouse is then left at that position the slideshow still pauses.</p>

<p>Now when the mouse leaves the slider or clicks on a new thumbnail then the hover image correctly moves to the next clicked slide and subsequently if the mouse leaves the slider container the slideshow continues with the hover image shown at the correct slide.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile:</strong> However this behaviour is different on Firefox and Chrome latest version for Android. I am testing on a Samsung S4 however I think this can also be observed on other devices.</p>

<p>What happens here is that when a thumbnail image has been tapped, the slider moves to the correct slide and the arrow navigators show up.</p>

<p><em>However</em> now when letting the slideshow to continue further the highlighted thumbnail stays highlighted and the arrows keep showing.</p>

<p>This leads to the hover image cycling through the thumbnail gallery highlighted instead of only highlighting the thumbnail that is currently being shown in the slider.</p>

<p>In the thumbnail navigator skin 7 I commented out the following since otherwise the highlighted border will keep showing.</p>

<pre><code>/* if the mouse stays on the clicked image the hover colour will not fade to white
    this leads to the hover colour staying like this on mobile devices since
    the device, once clicked on the thumbnail gallery beliefs that the finger
    is still resting on the thumbnail and therefore keeps the thumbnail hover colour
    making it cycle through the thumbnail gallery
.jssort07 .pav:hover .o
{
    border-color: #0099FF; (light blue)
} */
</code></pre>

<p>Commenting that selector did help in the way that the once tapped thumbnail does not keep the light blue colour and cycles through the slideshow with it but it simply keeps the white border like the thumbnail navigator 7 should be.</p>

<p>I would like the thumbnail gallery behave in the way that once a thumbnail is tapped the highlight border or highlight image moves to that thumbnail and when the slideshow is then being left to continue it should correctly only highlight the currently shown slide and not let the old, previously tapped slide keep being highlighted.</p>

<p>Ideally also the arrow navigators should, once tapped on the thumbnail and once the slide has moved to the tapped thumbnail either also stop being highlighted or be shown at all times, before and after a tap on the thumbnail.</p>

<p>I think what is happening here is that somehow once tapped on the thumbnail gallery the event it not stopped on the smartphone, making the arrow navigators continue to show (that is not that bad) but also keep the highlight image or highlight border colour on the tapped thumbnail while continuing with the slideshow. This leads to two highlighted thumbnails in the end. One indicating the right position of the currently shown slide and the other one cycling through the thumbnail gallery.</p>

<p>If you (JSSOR author) have a smartphone you can observe this behaviour on the default Image Gallery demo as well. If you could update the image gallery demo to change this behaviour this would be great. Otherwise if you could let me know how I can stop this from happening that would also be really really nice. Apart from this little quirk it works really nice and fast on the mobile.</p>

<p>Thank you for any help.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong> I forgot to mention that when after the initial first on the thumbnail gallery I tap anywhere outside the slider container the highlight image or highlight border of the first tapped thumbnail stops being highlighted and the arrow navigators also stop showing. So it clearly has to do something with tapping inside the slider container. I hope all this info can help you find a way to get rid of this behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2 :</strong>
OK, with your answer I managed to get the exact behaviour for mobile that I wanted. However I also changed the transition states a bit.</p>

<p>What was happening is that once a thumbnail is tapped the white border would light up shortly, then the white border would go dark again while the thumbnail travelled/cycled to the tapped thumbnail and THEN it would light up again. I also managed to change for the opacity change this this was also happening with the opacity while the thumbnail travelled to the tapped item, it would light up, go dark while waiting for the item to be at the correct selection and then light up again.</p>

<p>Below is my html with inline css still. I believe this might also help other users coming across this behaviour on mobile/desktop.</p>

<p>After a few tests I come to realize that when I am happy with the behaviour on mobile it does not look good on desktop and if I am happy with the desktop behaviour it does not work properly on mobile.</p>

<p>Due to this I am thinking to either start using Modernizr to check for mobile browser and assign different active states for mobile browsers as opposed to desktop browsers, or I might try and get this working with a few lines of jQUery. Basically active and hover states are getting mixed or kind of double used for mobile and desktop if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Though <strong>perhaps all this can be avoided</strong> with the <code>.i</code>, <code>.o</code> and <code>.p</code> classes I wonder? Can you please let me know what these classes are for in the Thumbnail navigator skin? If I could style the active and hover states differently for mobile and desktop with those classes that would be really really nice!</p>

<p>From this question <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24553757/jssor-undocumented-t3-d3-properties-how-to"">jssor: undocumented t3 d3 properties - how to</a> I found some information here: <a href=""http://www.jssor.com/development/slider-with-caption-jquery.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Slider with Caption (jQuery code)</a> but unfortunately I cannot seem to find information on the <code>.i</code>, <code>.o</code> and <code>.p</code> classes.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

To make it easy for our services to use, I have it just called with <code>Connect()</code> and use an event to let the caller know when there's a message.  This is basically how it will be called:</p>

<pre><code>SlackBot bot = new SlackBot(TOKEN);
bot.OnReceiveMessage += message =&gt; {
    Console.WriteLine(""DELEGATE GOT MESSAGE: '{0}'"", message);
};
bot.Connect();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Connect()</code> method calls an internal <code>Receive()</code> method that calls itself after every message:</p>

<pre><code>public delegate void MessageReceivedDelegate(string message);

public event MessageReceivedDelegate OnReceiveMessage;

void Receive()
{
    _ReceiveTask = _Client.ReceiveAsync(_ClientBuffer, _CancellationToken);
    _ReceiveTask.ContinueWith(twsrr =&gt;
    {
        WebSocketReceiveResult result = twsrr.Result;
        string message = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(_ClientBuffer.Array,
             _ClientBuffer.Offset, result.Count);
        OnReceiveMessage(message);
        Receive();
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the largest buffer acceptable is 64k, do I need to check <code>result.EndOfMessage</code> and use a MemoryStream or something to to keep adding bytes to until I get the end of the message, then send it?  </p>

They both have parameterless constructors, as is required.  When I drop them onto my main form, I get an error in Visual Studio at design-time where it cannot render the form.</p>

<p>What I discovered is that, in the form's Designer.cs file, where my control is instantiated, the IDE is placing a line there that calls one of my setters.  <code>BlockKey = 0</code>.  Well, the code behind the setter is calling some other code, and quickly a NullReferenceException gets thrown because the form's not running; that other code is not prepared to produce anything at that point.  </p>

<p>If I manually remove the setter line, the error goes away.  But closing and re-opening, or re-compiling, the IDE puts the line back in again.  I tried decorating, inside the UserControl, the setter with <code>[DefaultValue(false)]</code>, thinking this would suppress the design-time call to the setter, but it did not.</p>

<p>How can I get rid of that line in the Designer?  Or am I expected to do write some preventative code inside the setter instead?</p>

<p>If I wanted to seacrh for users in a particular department, I'd code an $unwind clause and then a $match by department. However I'd like to use the same aggregation command for both scenarios, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>models.Users.aggregate(
        {   // SELECT

                    IF (filteringByDepartment){

                        $unwind departments here

      });

    },
</code></pre>

<p>The 'success' callback is well called but I don't manage to get the 'error' callback called once the model.validate() method is failing.</p>

<p>Here is the model with the validate method :</p>

    urlRoot: '/user',
    // Default attributes for the Contact
    defaults: {
      name: null,
      phone: null,

    },
    validate: function(attrs) {
      console.log('validate() : ' + JSON.stringify(attrs));
      var errors = [];
      if (!attrs.name) {
        errors.push({name: 'name', message: 'Please fill name field.'});
      }
      if (!attrs.category) {
        errors.push({name: 'category', message: 'Please fill category field.'});
      }
      console.log('errors : ' + JSON.stringify(errors));
      return errors.length &gt; 0 ? errors : false;
    }
  });
</code></pre>

<p>And the collection:</p>

<pre><code>  app.ContactsCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
    model: app.ContactModel,
    url: '/user',
    //localStorage: new Backbone.LocalStorage('contacts-backbone'),

    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>The thing is, as most of you might have already noticed, the <code>post_id</code> variable in the like.js does not hold the actual <code>post_id</code>. The <code>post_id</code> is stored in a PHP variable called <code>$id</code> in the PHP file.</p>

<p>Now, my question is, how would I take that <code>$id</code> from my PHP page and send it to my like.js to store the value in the <code>post_id</code> variable?</p>

<p>Any ideas are much appreciated! Thanks!</p>

<p>I have more block of if-else in my code. Initially, when an condition is matched, the session message is shown. But as soon as the page refresh an another session message is shown along with previous session message.</p>

<p>Is this correct way of coding with forms? Because i want to show error messages inside the html form.</p>

If the Java Console is enabled in the user's browser, it will of course retain references to all of these strings and prevent them from being garbage collected. The problem is the number of log messages the console retains: the applet heap grows very quickly. After four days of running, it will throw an OutOfMemory exception. So far as I can tell from jmap and jhat, the log strings represent the majority of its footprint.</p>

<p>Is there an API to more tightly limit the number or total size of messages retained by the Java Console? In case of an error I'd only need the most recent few messages. The Console does start retiring the oldest messages at some point, but only after it has grown really huge.</p>

<p>I realize that ""don't start the console"" or ""just clear the console"" are possible solutions, but have you ever tried asking a non-technical user whether they have the Java Console enabled? Or try to walk them through viewing and clearing it? I really would like them to leave the console enabled, so I can see the messages if there is an error.</p>

Currently when epiceditor displays, it has a very small default height, with scroll bars to handle viewing the entire content. I can manually set the height of the div, and for now that's the best I've been able to do (I've set it to something reasonably large: 800px). However I would like its height to always be enough to fit the entire content without scroll-bars. Essentially something like overflow:visible. </p>

<p>Here's the relevant  portions so far</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;script src=""/assets/javascripts/epiceditor/js/epiceditor.min.js""       type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And heres the edit.js source (its compiled from coffescript)</p>

<pre><code>$ -&gt;
    postMarkdown = $(""#postMarkdown"").first()

    options =
        basePath : '../../assets/javascripts/epiceditor'
    editor = new EpicEditor(options).load()
    postId = postMarkdown.data('postId')
    markdown = postMarkdown.html()
    editor.importFile('posts/'+postId,markdown);
    editor.reflow();
</code></pre>

<p>I  was hoping reflow might expand the height after the content was inserted, however no such luck. However If I resize the div and call reflow, It does resize properly.
I've inspected the markup it creates in hopes I could determine the height and resize its container and tell it to reflow. However it seems it contains multiple iframes, and at a glance I didn't expect that to be a quick change, or if it would even be possible. However I'd welcome any solution.</p>

<p>I also understand that if I size its container to the right height, epiceditor will fill the proper space. However I want its height to be the amount needed to render, such that the editor takes up the right space in the rest of the sites design. Therefore if there something I can set in EpicEditor to have it not overflow in the manner it is, or a way to determine the height after it loads, I'm set.
Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>I go on to continue the promise chain. Looks something like this</p>

<p>I want to add a catch statement to handle an individual promise in case it errors, but when I try, Promise.all returns the first error it finds (disregards the rest), and then I can't get the data from the rest of the promises in the array (that didn't error).</p>

<p>I've tried doing something like ..</p>

<pre><code>existingPromiseChain = existingPromiseChain.then(function() {
      var arrayOfPromises = state.routes.map(function(route){
        return route.handler.promiseHandler()

existingPromiseChain = existingPromiseChain.then(function(arrayResolved) {

});
</code></pre>

<p>But that doesn't resolve.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>What the answers below said were completely true, the code was breaking due to other reasons. In case anyone is interested, this is the solution I ended up with ...</p>

<p>Node Express Server Chain</p>

<pre><code>serverSidePromiseChain
    .then(function(AppRouter) {
        var arrayOfPromises = state.routes.map(function(route) {
            return route.async();
        });
        Promise.all(arrayOfPromises)
            .catch(function(err) {
                // log that I have an error, return the entire array;
                console.log('A promise failed to resolve', err);
                return arrayOfPromises;
            })
            .then(function(arrayOfPromises) {
                // full array of resolved promises;
            })
    };
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>API Call (route.async call)</p>

<pre><code>return async()
    .then(function(result) {
        // dispatch a success
        return result;
    })
    .catch(function(err) {
        // dispatch a failure and throw error
        throw err;
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Putting the .catch for Promise.all before the .then seems to have served the purpose of catching any errors from the original promises, but then returning the entire array to the next .then</p>

<p>Thanks! </p>

<p>My problem that I want to get ALL the stored data from datastore of these two kinds from javascript file.</p>

<p>I tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>function getData(syncedData) {

        syncedData();

        // set the ajax
        var options = {

            dataType: 'application/json',
            data:'{ ""query"": { }}'
        };

        // call the ajax
        return $.ajax(options)
            .then(querySucceeded)
            .fail(queryFailed);

        // handle the ajax callback
        function querySucceeded(data) {
            syncedData(data);
            log('Sync data succeeded', sites, true);
        }

        function queryFailed(jqXHR, textStatus) {
            log('Sync data Error. ' + textStatus, jqXHR, true);
        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>where the ""key=AIzaSyCHeg3tkyEENxAXKsl1xilX19BreDxWFzg"" is API Key I created as Public API access from Cloud Console; <strong>I really need any one can query this results.</strong></p>

<p>But using the above gives me <strong>401 (Unauthorized)</strong> at Chrome Console.</p>

<p>How can I query these results and make it PUBLIC;</p>

<p>Must I use OAuth API? any clear steps of using 'not the google-docs'?! and how to make it PUBLIC ACCESSED?!</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Thread #1</em> sends various messages and writes summary information to a MySQL database.</li>
<li><em>Thread #2</em> polls the database periodically (invoked by a <code>ScheduledExecutorService</code>) and acts on the current ""state"" of each message.</li>
</ul>

<p>Am fairly new to Hibernate but everything I've read says it manages its own session/transactions and this is a good thing that shouldn't be interfered with. I'm yet to be entirely convinced about this - call me old-fashioned but when stepping through code I like to see changes as they happen rather than just hoping they're ""in Hibernate's head""! Performance isn't really much of an issue here.</p>

<p>Furthermore there's an integration test problem: It doesn't seem to matter how long <em>Thread #2</em> waits for a new row to be added by <em>Thread #1</em>, it just isn't added during the test so the expected call isn't made. Then sure enough, after the test has failed a new row pops up - but too late. Not sure if this might be a design problem - <em>Thread #2</em> currently gets a Seam context using <code>Lifecycle.beginCall()...Lifecycle.endCall()</code>. So my understanding (which may be wrong) is possibly the problems are due to there being two separate Hibernate sessions for the two threads - so the one reading doesn't know about the latest information from the one writing?</p>

<p>There may be different ways of fixing this but my current thinking is couldn't I just force Hibernate to actually add a record to the table immediately when I call <code>save()</code> / <code>flush()</code> or even manually commit a transaction? No luck with any of these - makes me wonder if there is some kind of managed transaction being used behind the scenes. Grateful for any advice...</p>

<p>For info, here's the gist of the code that adds a record:</p>

<pre><code>// Obtain Hibernate session
Session session = (Session) Component.getInstance(""hibernateSession"");

// Create request
Request newRequest = new Request();
// newRequest.set&lt;blah&gt;();

// Save the new request to the database
session.save(newRequest);

// Have tried session.flush(), transaction.commit() etc. here.
// Nothing seems to put the record into the database straight away.
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure if this is relevant but here is the Hibernate configuration:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;property name=""transaction.flush_before_completion""&gt;true&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property name=""connection.release_mode""&gt;after_statement&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property name=""transaction.manager_lookup_class""&gt;org.hibernate.transaction.SunONETransactionManagerLookup&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property name=""transaction.factory_class""&gt;org.hibernate.transaction.JTATransactionFactory&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property name=""current_session_context_class""&gt;jta&lt;/property&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(As this is an existing application owned by the customer I don't have the right to change the Hibernate config.)</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>select cast(? as date)           -- in most databases
select cast(? as date) from dual -- in Oracle
</code></pre>

<p>Let's prepare and execute the statement with Java</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
stmt.setDate(1, new java.sql.Date(0)); // GMT 1970-01-01 00:00:00
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
rs.next();

// I live in Zurich, which is CET, not GMT. So the following prints -3600000, 
// which is CET 1970-01-01 00:00:00
// ... or   GMT 1969-12-31 23:00:00
System.out.println(rs.getDate(1).getTime());

<p>In other words, the GMT timestamp I bind to the statement becomes the CET timestamp I get back. At what step is the timezone added and why?</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have observed this to be true for any of these databases: </p>

<p>DB2, Derby, H2, HSQLDB, Ingres, MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, SQL Server, Sybase ASE, Sybase SQL Anywhere</p></li>
<li>I have observed this to be false for SQLite (which doesn't really have true <code>DATE</code> data types)</li>
<li>All of this is irrelevant when using <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code> instead of <code>java.sql.Date</code></li>
<li>This is a similar question, which doesn't answer this question, however: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2305973/java-util-date-vs-java-sql-date"">java.util.Date vs java.sql.Date</a></li>

<p>I am building a WordPress theme based on Zurbs <a href=""http://foundation.zurb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Foundation</a> (I am working with version 3.2.5 before switching to version 4)</p>

<p>I like the Top Bar navigation Foundation provides: <a href=""http://foundation.zurb.com/old-docs/f3/navigation.php"" rel=""nofollow"">Top Bar</a> and I have gotten it to do what I need it to. The issue I am having is with sub navigation. On a tablet or mobile phone any main links in the main menu that have sub links get turned into ""#"" links instead of being the actual links (hope that made sense)</p>

<p>I looked at the jquery.foundation.topbar.js file (here the entire file)</p>

<p>and found that one portion automatically inserts the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li class=""title back js-generated""&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is on line 120 and 130 of the code above. what I would like to do is remove that from the .top-bar when the script gets loaded.</p>

<p>Can someone explain how this can be done? I need any and all main links to remain main links when viewed on a tablet or mobile device instead of being turned into ""#"" links. Any help would be greatly appreciated and again I apologize if this question doesnt make any sense.</p>

<p>Currently my code validates the request url is syntactically correct before validating the authentication token.</p>

<p>However, I've been told this is potentially a security risk and I should be validating the authentication token first.</p>

<p>If I validate the input first I return a slightly different error message if it's invalid, compared to if I validate the token first and it's invalid.</p>

<p>If I do the token first it's computationally more expensive and potentially sends a 3rd party client round some expensive look ups to get a new token, and the request will still eventually fail.</p>

<p>Alternatively if I validate the input first, it seems cheaper all around and I can't think of a specific security hole apart from maybe it leaks information slightly on how my api works.</p>

<p>Are there any opinions out there on the correct behavior? I can't find any definitive articles or forum postings discussing this.</p>

<p>I successfully changed the <em>Platform target</em> dropdown from ""Active (x86)"" to ""Any CPU"", but the <em>Platform</em> dropdown has ""Active (x86)"" as the only option:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/O9bBK.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I don't know how this project got ""out of sync"" with the others as to this setting to begin with, and more importantly how to get it back in line with the others...</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>I think the problem may have been that my VS install was set to VB instead of C# (it was done by IT, and most of the cats here are VB developers).</p>

<p>This: <a href=""http://go4answers.webhost4life.com/Example/buildsolution-configuration-dropdown-188435.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://go4answers.webhost4life.com/Example/buildsolution-configuration-dropdown-188435.aspx</a> mentions Tools | Settings, but I have no such menu item.</p>

<p>I did select the option to reset settings to original, and the ""Settings Reset in Progress"" dialog has been churning away for nigh on to half an hour now, with VS ""(Not Responding"")</p>

<h2>UPDATE 2</h2>

<p>Now I'm having the opposite problem with a Windows CE project - I need it to be ""x86"" and it refuses to change to that from ""Any CPU"". </p>

<p>The reason why I want to change this setting is because when trying to run this app on a handheld device I'm getting the ""Can’t find P/Invoke DLL sqlcemeNN.dll"" err msg.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlservercompact/archive/2007/10/26/can-t-find-p-invoke-dll-sqlcemenn-dll.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>: ""<em>If your machine is a 64-bit box, you might have been got trapped into default target platform 'Any CPU' trap, please set the target platform as 'x86'.  Need more details, please visit ErikEJ's blog post.</em>""</p>

<p>My machine <em>is</em> 64-bit, and I did read <a href=""http://erikej.blogspot.com/2008/01/x64-and-sql-compact.html"" rel=""nofollow"">the blog post referenced</a></p>

<p>...but I have no ""x86"" option in my Confriguration Manager's ""Active Solution Platform"" dropdown. ""Any CPU"" is the only option it gives me...</p>

<p>I was able to somehow force the ""Active Solution Platform"" dropdown to say ""x86"" after typing that in, but I don't think it really changed anything. In the grid, the only option is ""Any CPU"". Selecting ""Edit..."" (there is no ""New..."") from the ""Project"" column just shows ""Any CPU"" in the list, a greyed-out ""Remove"" button, and a Close button (""greyedoutprojectplatforms.png"")</p>

<p>So what I tried is I changed every instance of ""Any CPU"" in the project's .csproj file to ""x86"" and STILL it says ""Any CPU"" in Project > Properties > Build > Platform Target!</p>

<p>So true with the documentation, the first thing I did was installing the ""selenium-webdriver"" which I opened up cmd and typed ""npm install selenium-webdriver"". It responded with saying what directory it installed and the version it installed which was 2.42.1.</p>

<p>After this I installed the ChromeDriver 2.10 from their home download page. After this I unziped the file and moved chromedriver.exe to ""node_modules\selenium-webdriver\ChromeDriver"" and added it to my systems environmental variables.</p>

<p>So then the next step was to test it, so I copy pasted ""npm test selenium-webdriver"" into the cmd and got this following error. [Error]<a href=""http://imgur.com/xIYE3oa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/xIYE3oa</a> I also tried running ChromeDriver after I kept running into this error and tried it again to get the same result.

I.e. imagine a list of messages, and once a user clicks on one of them, it expands and exposes a list of comments/meta-info for this message. I want this to be in its own nested controller.</p>

<p>I believe my controller etc. is all set up correctly, the only problem is that when I click on a message, it reveals the comment box under every message, not just the one clicked.</p>

<p>Here is the HTML of my main view:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul ng-show=""messages.length""&gt;
  &lt;li ng-repeat=""message_i in messages""&gt;
    &lt;a ui-sref="".message({id: message_i.id })""&gt;
      {{message_i.title}}
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;div ui-view&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works perfectly, i.e. when clicking on the <code>ui-sref</code> link, the nested view appears, it's just rendered in every single <code>ui-view</code>, not just the one of the clicked message.</p>

<p>I tried adding a condition to the <code>ui-view</code>-div to make sure it's the right iteration of the loop, e.g. <code>ng-if=""message_i.id==id""</code>, but this is giving me an error. I guess I can't simply access the nested <code>.message</code>'s <code>id</code> parameter.</p>

<p>So is there a way to solve this with an if-condition? Or do I have do it another way?</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, when I plugged in my iPhone to test it, the iPhone does not appears under that section, and does not appear to have a drive letter associated to it...</p>

<p>But here is my main question, why does the windows message DBT_DEVNODES_CHANGED fire when I add the iPhone, but the DBT_DEVICEARRIVAL message fires when I add the camera?</p>

However, as of right now, even the Euler integration doesn't work. Here's the code in Moon.cpp</p>

<pre><code>//Declare the masses
float MMass = 109.456;
float EMass = 1845.833;

//New velocities
float NewMVelX = 0.0;
float NewMVelY = 0.0;
float NewMVelZ = 0.0;

//Distance
float DistanceX = 0.0;
float DistanceY = 0.0;
float DistanceZ = 0.0;

//Earth's velocity
float EVelocityX = 0.0;
float EVelocityY = 0.0;
float EVelocityZ = 0.0;

//Moon's base velocity
float MVelocityX = 0.1;
float MVelocityY = 0.0;
float MVelocityZ = 0.0;

//Moon's acceleration
float MForceX = 0.0;
float MForceY = 0.0;
float MForceZ = 0.0;

//New position
float MPositionX = 0.0;
float MPositionY = 0.0;
float MPositionZ = 0.0;

// Called every frame
void AMoon::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
    Super::Tick(DeltaTime);

    //Get Earth Location
    FVector EPosition = FVector(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);

    //Get Moon Location
    FVector MPosition = GetActorLocation();

    //Get the distance between the 2 bodies
    DistanceX = (MPosition.X - EPosition.X) / 100;
    DistanceY = (MPosition.Y - EPosition.Y) / 100;
    //DistanceZ = MPosition.Z - EPosition.Z / 100; 


    //Get the acceleration/force for every axis
    MForceX = G * MMass * EMass / (DistanceX * DistanceX);
    MForceY = G * MMass * EMass / (DistanceY * DistanceY);
    //MForceZ = G * MMass * EMass / (DistanceZ * DistanceZ);


    //Get the new velocity
    NewMVelX = MVelocityX + MForceX;
    NewMVelY = MVelocityY + MForceY;
    //NewMVelZ = MVelocityZ + MForceZ * DeltaTime;

    //Get the new location
    MPositionX = (MPosition.X) + NewMVelX;
    MPositionY = (MPosition.Y) + NewMVelY;
    //MPositionZ = MPosition.Z * (MVelocityZ + NewMVelZ) * 0.5 * DeltaTime;

    //Set the new velocity on the old one
    MVelocityX = NewMVelX;
    MVelocityY = NewMVelY;

    FVector NewMPosition = FVector(MPositionX, MPositionY, MPositionZ);

    //Set the new location
    SetActorLocation(NewMPosition);

<p>The values might not be right, I was just making tests at this point. I based this code on the different pieces of information I got on Google and multiple websites but at this point I'm quite confused. What is happening is that the Moon just starts going in 1 direction and never stops. I know my issue is with the force/acceleration/actual gravity of the Earth, it should pull the Moon not push it away. But anyway, if anyone has an idea what I'm doing wrong, I'd be very grateful to hear what you have to say! Thanks</p>

<p>My issue is that my images don't have individual urls to set FB og tags against. I believe I'd need to create this dynamically and assign them to each image? but I'm not sure how to approach this??</p>

<p>I modified the code as advised by SCX in the comments below (Thanks so much SCX) but we are not quite there yet. Here is the modified code:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(document).ready(function(){
    $('#edit-ad-location').autocomplete({
                source:'/postcodes-latlong.php',
                minLength:2,

                   //ui have response from you call
                   //console.log(ui);
                   //assign your values like this
                   $('#geo-search-lat').val( ui[0]['geo-search-lat'] );
                   $('#geo-search-lng').val( ui[0]['geo-search-lng'] );
                }
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>This returns the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'geo-search-lat' of undefined
</code></pre>

<p>I should have mentioned that the array can contain many record entries and not just one.</p>

<pre><code>{""0"":
      {""id"":""384047"",
       ""label"":""4503, DAKABIN"",
       ""value"":""4503, DAKABIN"",
       ""geo-search-lat"":""-27.226474"",
       ""geo-search-lng"":""152.980732""},
   ""1"":
       {""id"":""384062"",

    ""2"":

         ""label"":""4503, KALLANGUR"",
         ""value"":""4503, KALLANGUR"",
         ""geo-search-lat"":""-27.25075"",
         ""geo-search-lng"":""152.992606""},
     ""3"":
       {""id"":""384092"",
        ""label"":""4503, KURWONGBAH"",
        ""value"":""4503, KURWONGBAH"",
        ""geo-search-lat"":""-27.225828"",
        ""geo-search-lng"":""152.947552""},
   ""4"":{
        ""id"":""384107"",
        ""label"":""4503, MURRUMBA DOWNS"",
        ""value"":""4503, MURRUMBA DOWNS"", 
        ""geo-search-lat"":""-27.258672"",
        ""geo-search-lng"":""153.006916""},

        ""geo-search-lng"":""152.929729""
        }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>So I tried modifying SCX's two beautiful lines of code like this:</p>

<pre><code>  $('#geo-search-lat').val( ui[]['geo-search-lat'] );
  $('#geo-search-lng').val( ui[]['geo-search-lng'] );
</code></pre>

<p>and also like this:</p>

<pre><code>  $('#geo-search-lat').val( ui['geo-search-lat'] );
  $('#geo-search-lng').val( ui['geo-search-lng'] );
</code></pre>

<p>But neither of these work.</p>

<p>So let's say if for instance from the autocomplete pull down menu I select 4503, KALLANGUR,, the associated 'geo-search-lat' and 'geo-search-lng' array elements would be:</p>

<p><code>ui[2]['geo-search-lat']</code> and <code>ui[2]['geo-search-lng']</code>, correct?</p>

<p>This is my train of thought behind removing the ui[0] and replacing it with ui[] - but this doesn't work.</p>

<p>I need some way to send the record number 'x' to the ui['x'].</p>

<p>TIA.</p>

<p>The method takes aPGResult result from a SQL query and displays horizontal bars.
That all works fine but I want labels using OrderedCollection names on the left of each bar. I tried using the code below as seen on this forum:</p>

<pre><code> values do: [ :value | 
| bar label |
label := ROLabel elementOn: value asString.
diagram rawView add: label.
bar := diagram rawView elementFromModel: value.
ROConstraint move: label onTheLeftOf: bar ].
</code></pre>

<p>But it gives error: Receiver of position is nil. This means that elementFromModel method cannot find the model.</p>

<p>When a user creates an Order in the API, it will submit a JSON that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""order"": {
      ""draws"": [
        {
            ""background_color"" : ""rgb(0,0,0)"", ""font_size"" : 14
        }, 
        {
           ""background_color"" : ""rgb(255,0,0)"", ""font_size"" : 16
        },
        ...
       ]
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, my application will return a tracking number to the User so he can see what is the current status for that Order, and will push that JSON to a queue so that it can be processed in the background.</p>

<p>However, I have a problem:</p>

<p>Once the Order is completed, and the User fetches the Order, I will return a list of Draws. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>      ""draws"": [
        {
            ""background_color"" : ""rgb(0,0,0)"", ""font_size"" : 14, ""url"" : ""generated_url""
        }, 
        {
           ""background_color"" : ""rgb(255,0,0)"", ""font_size"" : 16, ""url"" : ""generated_url2""
        },
        ...
       ]
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is: </p>

<p>How will the User know which Draw from the results is a draw from what he submited? Here is two solutions I have thought of:</p>

<p>1 - When the user submits the Order, for each of the Draws he submits a unique id, so later when those are created, he will be able to map them.</p>

<p>2 - When the user submits the Order, my application creates a unique id for each of the Draws. And later when the Draws are actually created in the DB, I put that unique id into the DB.</p>

<p>What is more reasonable, taking into account that an Order can have up to 100.000 draws.</p>

<p>This was working - when I put a breakpoint here it stopped. But, is there a better way to implement a handler for such a case? I mean, the whole authentication part is done ""under the hood"" and I cannot really debug if something goes wrong and this method is not called, I have no other way to know where something went wrong on the way.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I would like to implement the same sort of thing for an unsigned ssl certificate but I am a bit of a novice at Java or Android programming and find some previous responses to similar questions very confusing.</p>

<p>Could someone change the code above to work with HTTPS requests?</p>

<p>One other question, would there be a risk of a middle-man-attack if I sent unencrypyted data via the GET request and print out database entries onto the webpage that the function returns the content of. Would it be better to use a POST request?</p>

<p>The reason I chose to use SSL is because someone told me that the data sent is encrypted. The data is sensitive and if I send something like localhost/login.php?user=jim&amp;password=sd7vbsksd8 which would return ""user=jim permission=admin age=23"" which is data that I don't want others to see if they simply used a browser and sent the same request.</p>

It is quite normal that application sometimes has internal server errors even though the code wouldn't have any bugs e.g. when database server is not available for some time. In these situations it would naturally be desired that the application container would automatically continue working normally when e.g. database becomes available again.</p>

<p>So far I have found only this solution ( <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6790156/gunicorn-internal-server-errors"">Gunicorn Internal Server Errors</a> ) which keeps making requests and checking whether application has crashed and restarts it in case it has.

I'm adding a new method to the ServiceContract that will be called from a console app to perform an administrative task. I got to thinking, well wouldn't it be nice if I gave this method its own endpoint. Then I thought and what if that endpoint wasn't even publicly accessible. It would be much better if only a computer on our LAN could access it. It might even be cool if only an AD administrator was authorized to use it, but I don't want to get too elaborate. So I added a new ServiceContract interface that includes my new method. How can I restrict it to LAN access only? Do I need a NetTcpBinding? Networking is not my strong suit and I'm a little confused, conceptually, on how a TCP endpoint could be hosted from IIS. Additionally, when hosting multiple endpoints, does each have to have its own address or can they be at the same address?</p>

<p>So I have been using an xml file which has the layout for each screen all in the one file. And I use Java to program which to display each screen required and hide the ones I don't need. The problem I have with this approach is it means all my Java is one file, and all my XML is in one file. Could someone explain to me a better way of doing this as I am pretty sure there must be a better way. My activity has many screens and its getting an eye sore scrolling through all this code at once, as the more screens I add, the larger the code is getting.</p>

<p>Ideally I would like to have the code for each screen in its own Java class, and the layouts for each screen in their own xml files and just switch between these. </p>

<p>To give you example of my code</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TabHost android:id=""@+id/tabhost"" android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustResize""
xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
android:background=""#92c223"" android:layout_height=""fill_parent""&gt;

&lt;LinearLayout android:id=""@+id/tab1""
android:layout_above=""@android:id/tabs""    android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""&gt;
        &lt;ScrollView android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
            android:layout_height=""wrap_content""&gt;
            &lt;RelativeLayout android:layout_width=""match_parent""
                android:layout_height=""wrap_content""&gt;
XML CODE FOR LAYOUT GOES IN HERE. EACH NEW SCREEN IS CONTAINED WITHIN THESE LAYOUTS.
            &lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;
        &lt;/ScrollView&gt;
    &lt;/LinearLayout&gt;

&lt;TabWidget android:layout_width=""fill_parent"" android:id=""@android:id/tabs"" android:layout_weight=""0""
 android:layout_gravity=""bottom""      android:layout_height=""wrap_content""&gt;&lt;/TabWidget&gt;
&lt;/FrameLayout&gt;
 &lt;/TabHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in my Java code, I switch between tabs using </p>

<pre><code>if (""home"".equals(tabId)) {
                tab1.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
                tab2.setVisibility(View.GONE);
                tab3.setVisibility(View.GONE);
                tab4.setVisibility(View.GONE);
                tab5.setVisibility(View.GONE);
</code></pre>

<p>and when switching between screens within an activity, when user clicks a button in that activity, I use on click listener and do this</p>

<pre><code>        tab2.setVisibility(View.GONE);
        cvv.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
</code></pre>

<p>I am sure there is a better way of doing this, and would be grateful if someone would give me suggestions.</p>

<p>Another problem is, as its all in one activity, whenever I hit the back button, it just exits the application. Would prefer to have it so when they hit back, it goes back to previous screen.</p>

<p>When removing this table view from the view hierarchy, the app crashes - sometimes - and now for the weird part: only if Accessibility is enabled! (i.e. the Accessibility Inspector is visible, or you have Accessibility enabled on a physical device)</p>

<p>If I do not override <code>+accessInstanceVariablesDirectly</code>, everything works fine. I figured maybe <code>UITableView</code> relies on accessing some instance variables directly - but then what is the point of this method, if I can break superclasses by using it? Is there a way to specify this behavior per-attribute, like <code>+automaticallyNotifiesObserversForKey:</code>? However I am baffled by the fact that this issue only exists when Accessibility is enabled.</p>

<p>I tried analyzing the project with various Instruments, but without success.</p>

<p>You can find a minimal project reproducing the issue <a href=""https://github.com/jenox/stackoverflow/tree/master/EXC_BAD_ACCESS"">here</a>. I would greatly appreciate any pointers on why this is happening or how to achieve what I want nonetheless.</p>

      projects_controller.reloadData
    end
  end

<p>While this will work the code feels dirty. Not really following the single responsibility principle. I would like to extract this in a few methods:</p>

<pre><code>def self.populateProjectsTable(projects_controller)
  @taskList = TaskList.new
  @taskList.doLogin
  projects = @taskList.getProjects
  projects_controller.projects = projects
  projects_controller.reloadData
end

def doLogin
  payload = {email: ""email"", password: ""pass""}
  HTTP.post(""http://example.com/login"", {payload: payload}) do |response|

def getProjects
  HTTP.get(""http://example.com/projects.json"", {cookie: @authCookie}) do |response|
    projects = JSON.parse(response.body.to_str)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This obviously does not work. The <code>getProjects</code> method is called before <code>doLogin</code> is finished and the projects are only known in the scope of the block, not giving back the data to the <code>populateProjectsTable</code> method.</p>

Once transaction is added\updated or removed from the system the account total has to be re-calculated and displayed to the user instantly. Users have access to certain accounts in the system but not all.</p>

<p>Below is a link to the screenshot of the tables that hold account and transaction data.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/EqV7w.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/EqV7w.png</a></p>

<p>Currently in order to get the account total I use the following query:</p>

<pre><code>select sum(t.Amount) 
from [Transaction] t
join [Account] a on a.AccountId=t.AccountId
where a.AccountId=@AccountId
</code></pre>

<p>I have non-unique non-clustered index on the Transaction table on AccountId and Amount columns which allows the query to quickly find transactions by AccountId.</p>

<p>It does what I want but my concern is that Transaction table is growing pretty fast, currently I have around 1 million records there and over time I expect it to reach tens of millions. Also the number of users that can actively edit transactions is growing as well, I have around 5500 of them in the system. </p>

<p>I am looking into a solution to limit the use of Transaction table when getting the total $ for the account so the system can scale out. I have 2 solutions for that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Calculate account total on demand by asking users to click on a certain button when they need that information. I might go that route but I want to still explore my options with the real time update of the account total. </li>
<li>Store a running total some place else and use it to calculate account total. There is a limitation that is associated with it as everything has to be done through a single interface that would know about all these nuances. Editing transactions in the database would be tricky since you have to make sure the running total is updated as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am looking for other alternatives to calculating account total in real time without worrying about database performance.</p>

Long story short:</p>

<p>What I figured out is that Object has a method clone() which can ""magically"" clone your object. But you can't use that method without implementing Cloneable Interface because this interface allows Object to use the clone() method. So why did they do that? Why shouldn't every object be cloneable from the start?</p>

<p>In order to handle a task, a worker has to create a lease.</p>

<pre><code>PUT .../leases
</code></pre>

<p>If the task queue has tasks available, this will succeed, a lease will be created and the server responds with status <code>201</code>.</p>

<p>I am unsure how to handle this case when no tasks are available. It is not possible to create a lease, when no tasks are available. Which HTTP status code would be appropriate for this case?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>204 No Content</code> - The client hasn't made anything wrong, but there is no data. </p></li>
<li><p><code>400 Bad Request</code> - This is imho not applicable, as it means ""the request could not be understood by the server"", which is not the case</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the meantime I thought that this approach might not be ideal. Either I use <code>503</code>, as recommended of Brian and also backed by a passage of <a href=""http://restinpractice.com"" rel=""nofollow"">REST in practice</a>, or I change the whole process.</p>

<p>I was thinking of leases which could be created tentatively. That means</p>

<ol>
<li><code>PUT</code> to <code>/leases</code></li>
<li>Either create a lease, assign a task and respond with <code>201</code> or create a tentative lease and respond with <code>202</code></li>
<li>Tentative leases will stay for some time. If tasks gets available, they are assigned to the tentative leases. If there is no task for a specific period of time, the lease gets deleted and the server will respond with <code>410</code></li>
<li>The client should then start again with 1.</li>

Consider the situation where I am running a P2P overlay network , part of which lives within the boundaries of a single LAN. The nodes within this LAN have the following link local addresses (as viewed by themselves):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Peer 1</strong> fe80::225:4bff:fea8:e200%en0</li>
<li><strong>Peer 2</strong> fe80::225:4bff:fea8:e201%eth1</li>
<li><strong>Peer 3</strong> fe80::225:4bff:fea8:e202%en1</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, assume each peer has been able to discover the others through some means, and have the addresses for each other. Each peer is listening on a port, say 12345. If peer 1 wanted to talk to peer 2, they might try and use the URI:</p>

<p>tcp://[fe80:225:4bff:fea8:e201%eth1]:12345</p>

<p>This is where I run into problems. Peer 1 does not have an adapter named ""eth1"", and so this IPv6 zone identifier is not known to it. If the zone ID is stripped off of the address, peer 1 cannot determine which of it's adapters it must use to contact the host.</p>

<p>So, the question: is it possible to resolve the zone identifier for an IPv6 address in a standard way? If not, do I have to query the system for all of the zone identifiers, and try connecting to the address using each zone identifier in turn until I get success? Or is attempting to communicate using link-local addresses a stupid idea in the first place?</p>

Basically, the data is called with one AJAX call, I'm storing that in an array of objects and I'm doing live filtering without making additional AJAX calls. When the checkboxes are checked I'm using .match() and I'm basically creating the regular expression as string values in an array (k is the category object property, such as category1):</p>

<pre><code>filterArgs.push(""(data['"" + k + ""'].join(', ').match(/"" + filters[k].join('') + "".+/))"");
</code></pre>

<p>The filters array is set up in a loop above that and it looks like this (v is the actual string value - the category name):</p>

<pre><code>filters[k][z] = '(?=.*\\b' + v[z] + '\\b)';
</code></pre>

<p>Then I'm joining the filterArgs:</p>

<pre><code>return filterArgs.join(' &amp;&amp; ');

<p>filterArgs is currently passed to an if statement condition with eval like this:</p>

<pre><code>if(eval(filter_setup())){

<p>So, if that if statement is true, the correct object from the main data array is included in the filtered set of data. I'm probably going to switch to jQuery's $.grep instead of that if statement but I still run into the same eval issue. Is there any other way to build a dynamic regular expression? It's working fine with eval but I've read all the articles saying how ""evil"" it is. The if statement condition ends up looking like the following (2 boxes checked in the first group and 1 in another group):</p>

<pre><code>(data['type'].join(', ').match(/(?=.*\bRestaurant\b)(?=.*\bBar\b).+/)) &amp;&amp; (data['state'].join(', ').match(/(?=.*\bWashington\b).+/))

<p>So It seems simple but I have one requirement - use of native OS apis as much as possible - no external libs - after all - all we want is to print out a a list - not to fly onto the moon!)  (and no use of objective-C, please - pure C/C++)</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>Your idea of doing ""RemoveFieldRef and FieldRef it right back in"" would be the same as setting the properties ""Required"" and ""Default Value"" through the interface for the ""Document"" or inherited content types though your idea would help if we are building custom content types.</p>

<p>Setting ""Title"" to required does not work in all situations. One such situation is when you try to add a item through ""New"" (which in my case opens up a template based on office 2007).</p>

<p>Since ""Title"" as required field was giving me hard time, I wanted to try the ""DefaultValue"" route but even this one does not seem to work. Any help?</p>

The application must generate all possible word combinations (can be verified via a dictionary) from a two-dimensional char array (char[][] board). The board is dynamic as the user can choose the scale: 4x4, 5x5, 4x5, 5x4, 4x6, ... So I guess a nested loop wouldn't be approriate here, correct me if I'm wrong. Words must be generated horizontally, verticaly and diagonally. Example of a 4x4 board:</p>

<p>| u | a | u | s |</p>

<p>| n | n | i | i |</p>

<p>| a | o | e | b |</p>

<p>| e | u | e | z |</p>

The data itself is held in ViewModel class, and View class is responsible to reflect changes in ViewModel. The main part of the View is ContentControl. When data changes in ViewModel, a hierarchical structure of controls is (re)generated and top-level control becomes the Content of the ContentControl. Of course, those hierarchical controls have bindings.
Now it's time to close the editor. ViewModel reacts to command and clears the data. PropertyChanged is raised and the View is ready to react: it attempts to do</p>

There are many interactions with javascript functions called by user events on the webpage, such as zooming to a certain x,y point. This event is usually accomplished via the mouse wheel.</p>

<p>Now I have to make sure that the thing works on tablet pc, in particular the Galaxy Tab. The first thing I have to fix is that, obviously, there is no mouse wheel and the user naturally tries to pinch zoom the flash application, with the result of zooming the entire web browser.</p>

<p>What I need is to listen to the multitouch gesture and, when a pinch zoom event is called, disable the default zooming event and call a javascript/flash function that allows my flash app to zoom only the objects that need to be zoomed: in few words, the browser stays still and only a part of the flash zooms in or out.</p>

<p>Consider that I am totally new to Android and that I already have working javascript functions to call flash object functions for the zooming purpose, so I just need to connect them to some android things that tell me when the user tries to pinch zoom in and when he tries to pinch zoom out (and possibly the x,y point of zoom).</p>

&lt;!-- ================================================= --&gt;
&lt;!--
 To enable clustering for this node, set the value of ""enable"" attribute of the ""clustering""
 element to ""true"". The initialization of a node in the cluster is handled by the class
 corresponding to the ""class"" attribute of the ""clustering"" element. It is also responsible for
 getting this node to join the cluster.
 --&gt;
&lt;clustering class=""org.wso2.carbon.core.clustering.hazelcast.HazelcastClusteringAgent""
            enable=""true""&gt;

    &lt;!--
       This parameter indicates whether the cluster has to be automatically initalized
       when the AxisConfiguration is built. If set to ""true"" the initialization will not be
       done at that stage, and some other party will have to explictly initialize the cluster.
    --&gt;
    &lt;parameter name=""AvoidInitiation""&gt;true&lt;/parameter&gt;

    &lt;!--
       The membership scheme used in this setup. The only values supported at the moment are
       ""multicast"" and ""wka""

       1. multicast - membership is automatically discovered using multicasting
       2. wka - Well-Known Address based multicasting. Membership is discovered with the help
                of one or more nodes running at a Well-Known Address. New members joining a
                cluster will first connect to a well-known node, register with the well-known node
                and get the membership list from it. When new members join, one of the well-known
                nodes will notify the others in the group. When a member leaves the cluster or
                is deemed to have left the cluster, it will be detected by the Group Membership
                Service (GMS) using a TCP ping mechanism.

<p>How can event from Bean can be sent to listener?</p>

<p><strong>Update.</strong></p>

<p>I have a Jetty WebSocket server that is running in the listener.</p>

<pre><code>public class JettyServletContextListener implements ServletContextListener {

    private Server server = null;

    public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent event) {
            this.server = new Server();
            server.start();
    }

    public void contextDestroyed(ServletContextEvent event) {
        if (server != null) {
            server.stop();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This Jetty server should notifу remote client about events in the Bean though WebSocket connection.</p>

<p>I want a video from youtube to loop and to show no controls/title/logo.</p>

<p>This is what i found so far. </p>

<p>For the loop : youtube recommends setting loop=1 and playlist=video_id. It works and it doesn't in the same time. Why, because the video is reloading over and over again, a loading screen appears every time the video is loaded, it takes so much bandwidth.</p>

<p>I found a website endlessvideo.com , it works so smooth but i don't know how they do it.</p>

<p>And for the controls and logo, i want them hidden. If i'm using modestbranding=1 and controls=0, a title appears.
If i'm adding showinf=0, the logo appears on mouseover the video.</p>

<p>Is there a way to override this?</p>

<p>I got a copy of the ffmpeg's api-example.c (<a href=""https://www.ffmpeg.org/doxygen/0.6/api-example_8c-source.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ffmpeg.org/doxygen/0.6/api-example_8c-source.html</a>). I tested the function video_encode_example() and got the code working as expected.</p>

<p>I then re-factored this function into different class methods and now I get a seg fault with the call to avcodev_open(). I then changed the code to call the original video_encode_example() from a class method and the calls to avcodec... were successful.</p>

<p>It appears that when called from a function (eg video_encode_example()), the behaviour is as expected, but avcodev_open fails when called from a class method. I traced the code and in both cases the values for the avcodev_open() arguments are assigned (and similar) pointer values. cgdb reports that the seg fault occurs in avcodev_open2()</p>

<p>Any suggestions? 
The code was compiled and tested on a Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit machine) using the libav package available thru apt-get (libavcodec.so.53.35.0)</p>

<p>Regards,
Daniel</p>

<p>Added comment following the first response:</p>

<p>From the link above, I copied the function video_encode_example() and placed the call inside a class constructor. This part is working. </p>

<pre><code>VideoEncoder::VideoEncoder( const std::string&amp; aFileName)
    : mCodec( NULL)
    , mCodecContext( NULL)
    , picture (NULL)
    , mFileName( aFileName)
    , mFileHandler( NULL)
{
    // must be called before using avcodec lib
    ::avcodec_init();

    // register all the codecs
    ::avcodec_register_all();

    video_encode_example( aFileName.c_str());
    return;
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The re-factored part includes splitting the avcodev call (from the original video_encode_example() function) to different VideoEncoder methods. The constructor now looks like:</p>

<pre><code>VideoEncoder::VideoEncoder( const std::string&amp; aFileName)
    : mCodec( NULL)
    , mCodecContext( NULL)

    , mFileHandler( NULL)
{
    // must be called before using avcodec lib
    ::avcodec_init();

    // register all the codecs
    ::avcodec_register_all();

    // find the mpeg1 video encoder
    mCodec = ::avcodec_find_encoder( CODEC_ID_MPEG1VIDEO);
    if (!mCodec) {
        fprintf( stderr, ""codec not found\n"");
        exit( 1);
    }

    mCodecContext = ::avcodec_alloc_context3( mCodec);
    picture = ::avcodec_alloc_frame();

    // put sample parameters
    mCodecContext-&gt;bit_rate = 400000;

    // frames per second
    mCodecContext-&gt;time_base = (AVRational){1,25};
    mCodecContext-&gt;gop_size = 10;               // emit one intra frame every ten frames
    mCodecContext-&gt;max_b_frames = 1;
    mCodecContext-&gt;pix_fmt = PIX_FMT_YUV420P;

    // open it
    // Initializes the AVCodecContext to use the given AVCodec. Prior to using this function the context has to be allocated.
    if (::avcodec_open( mCodecContext, mCodec) &lt; 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, ""could not open codec\n"");
        exit( 1);
    }

    mFileHandler = fopen( mFileName.c_str(), ""wb"");
    if (!mFileHandler) {
        fprintf( stderr, ""could not open %s\n"", mFileName.c_str());
        exit( 1);
    }

}

<p>The call to avcodec_open causes the seg fault. In addition, the fault occurs whether using avcodev_.. or ::avcodev_...  </p>

<p>I've got nearly everything working as far as I can tell, the firewall was a hassle but I think i've got it now.</p>

<p>The last thing I can't quite work out is how to get the domain name I purchased pointing correctly to my server (I've always done this through a control panel before which automated most of it).</p>

<p>These are the steps I've taken so far (These may be wrong, I've been googling the thing like mad but everywhere tells me to do something different, so please let me know if something is wrong).</p>

<ul>
<li>Purchased name name, for sake of example ""mydomain.com""</li>
<li>Have server running Ubuntu 64 bit. IP address for sake of example ""1.2.3.4""</li>
<li><p>The host has provided me with 3 ""DNS Resolvers"", for sake of example: ""1.1.1.1"", ""1.1.1.2"", ""1.1.1.3""</p></li>
<li><p>I've set the hostname on my server</p></li>
<li>Running ""hostname"" in the terminal outputs: <code>mydomain</code></li>
<li><p>Checking /etc/hostname outputs: <code>mydomain.com</code></p></li>
<li><p>I've added those 3 DNS resolvers to my /etc/resolv.conf file like so:</p>

<pre><code>domain mydomain.com
search mydomain.com
nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 1.1.1.2
nameserver 1.1.1.3
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I've set the virtual host up in my httpd.conf file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:80&gt;
ServerName mydomain.com
ServerAlias mydomain
DocumentRoot /var/www/mysite
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Now from here on I've just been palying around with different things. At the moment I've gone into my domain registrar panel and set three nameservers as ""ns1.mydomain.com"", ""ns2.mydomain.com"", ""ns3.mydomain.com"".</p>

<p>I've installed webmin to try and set the DNS zone records and this is what I've got at the moment on the output of various commands:</p>

<p>(where 1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2, 1.1.1.3 are those DNS resolvers)</p>

<p>I am not sure how to use <code>collection.fetch()</code> to get data on the initial render.</p>

<p>I am calling the Flickr API to build some images.  When clicking the button the next page value should be passed to the <code>collection.url</code> and a new ajax request submitted to re-render the template.

The number of required nested loops increases with n and I could not figure out how to program the nested loops with increasing number. Any help will be greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>After some research, I found out this is the problem of ""compositions of n with all parts >1"" and the total number of possible compositions are Fibonacci numbers (Fn-1 for n).  </p>

I had only copied .cpp files from old computer to my new one.Those programs are all error free and are tested.So now i have to compile each files to get the output file.There are about 310 programs so it is really hard to compile each file separately.I usually save output file with the same file name without any extension.Is there any way to compile all files in the directory and save each files output separately. I'm looking forward for a command like this </p>

<pre><code>gcc *.cpp -o *

<p>Why does Android Studio v0.4.6 not create addition values directories with qualifiers like earlier versions do?</p>

<p>Have I missed a setting or explanation of why this has changed?</p>

<p><strong>Extra Details</strong></p>

<p>I was just watching a training video (see <a href=""http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/android-dotnet-developers-android-studio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/android-dotnet-developers-android-studio</a>) and I noticed it had a res directory structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>├───res
│   ├───drawable-hdpi
│   ├───drawable-mdpi
│   ├───drawable-xhdpi
│   ├───drawable-xxhdpi
│   ├───layout
│   ├───menu
│   ├───values
│   ├───values-sw600dp
│   ├───values-sw720dp-land
│   ├───values-v11
│   ├───values-v14
</code></pre>

<p>That video was using version v0.1.1 and had just created a project from scratch.  I've seen this directory structure before while trying out Android development with the ADT in Eclipse.</p>

<p>When I create a new project with version v0.4.6 (I downloaded it yesterday, 2014-03-23) I get this directory structure:</p>

<pre><code>├───res
│   ├───drawable-hdpi
│   ├───drawable-mdpi
│   ├───drawable-xhdpi
│   ├───drawable-xxhdpi
│   ├───layout
│   ├───menu
│   ├───values
│   ├───values-w820dp
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried different settings in the new project wizard for API levels but that doesn't seem to change this setup.  I tried searching in various places:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=label%3aSubcomponent-Tools-Studio&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars&amp;cells=tiles"" rel=""nofollow"">Android Issue Tracker</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/studio/cloud"" rel=""nofollow"">Source code for Android Studio (at least I think so)</a></li>

<li><a href=""http://tools.android.com/knownissues"" rel=""nofollow"">Android Tools Project Site - Known Issues</a></li>
<li>Here on Stackoverflow</li>
<li>And the internet in general via Google search</li>
</ul>

<p>I couldn't find anything that explained why it had suddenly changed from creating the extra values directories to creating just one extra directory.  I attempted to look for the source code of Android Studio but I having never looked at it before I think that might be a bit hard to find something like this.  It's not like they will have 'res/values' or 'res/values-v11' hard coded (at least you hope not) so it's not going to be easy to just find where the values get created.</p>

<p>When my application references a method of a controller, I do it that way (in <code>MyApp.Application</code>): </p>

<pre><code>Mb.app.getController('Main').myMethod();
</code></pre>

<p>It is already long, but I think this is the way to do.</p>

<p>When a controller calls it's own method in a closure, I was led to use this code (in <code>MyApp.controller.Main</code>:</p>

<pre><code>controllerMethodOne: function(){
    Ext.Ajax.request({
        url: ...,
        params: ...,
        success: (function(response){
            list = Ext.JSON.decode(response.responseText);
            list.forEach(function(item){
                storeMenu.add(
                    Ext.create('Ext.menu.Item', {
                        text: item.text,
                        handler: function(el){MyApp.app.getController('Main').controllerMethodTwo()}
                    })
                )
            })
        })
    })
},
</code></pre>

<p>I referenced the method with <code>MyApp.app.getController('Main').controllerMethodTwo()</code> because <code>this</code> is not refering to the controller object in the closure, and thus <code>this..controllerMethodTwo()</code>isn't working.</p>

<p>I find this utterly convoluted, and I hope someone has an idea to get around that <code>MyApp.app.getController</code>-workaround.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Thanks to all the suggestion I could optimize my code and came up with:</p>

<pre><code>// in my controller
    mixins: ['Mb.controller.mixin.StoreMenu'],
    // I use that style of menus in two controllers thats why I use a mixin
    init: function() {
        this.control({
            '#vg_storeMenu menuitem': {
                click: this.onStoreMenuClicked
            }
        })
    },

// the controller mixin
Ext.define('Mb.controller.mixin.StoreMenu', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',
    buildStoreMenu: function(store_name){
        var storeMenu = Ext.ComponentQuery.query('#' + store_name + 'Menu')[0];
        Ext.Ajax.request({
            url: Paths.ajax + 'json.php',
            params: {list: store_name + 's'},
            success: (function(response){
            list = Ext.JSON.decode(response.responseText);
            items = Ext.Array.map(list, function(item) {
                return {
                    xtype: 'menuitem',
                    text: item.text
                }
            });
                storeMenu.add(items);
            })

<p>I'm now at a point where I'm integrating with a 3rd party Java library, and am stuck at working with this method:</p>

<pre><code>public Email addAttachment(String name, InputStream file) throws IOException {
    this.attachments.put(name, file);
    return this;
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I have in my API is the body returned from a <code>WS</code> HTTP call that is an <code>Enumerator[Array[Byte]]</code>.</p>

<p>I am wondering now how to write an <code>Iteratee</code> that would process the chunks of <code>Array[Bytes]</code> and create an <code>InputStream</code> to use in this method.</p>

<p><em>(Side bar): There are other versions of the <code>addAttachment</code> method that take <code>java.io.File</code> however I want to avoid writing to the disk in this operation, and would rather deal with streams.</em></p>

<p>I attempted to start by writing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Iteratee.foreach[Array[Byte]] { bytes =&gt;
    ???
}
</code></pre>

<p>However I'm not sure how to interact with the java <code>InputStream</code> here. I found something called a <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/ByteArrayInputStream.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>ByteArrayInputStream</code></a> however that takes the entire <code>Array[Byte]</code> in its constructor, which I'm not sure would work in this scenario as I'm working with chunks ?</p>

<p>I probably need some Java help here!</p>

<p>Thanks for any help in advance.</p>

My first controller (ViewController) is simply a view controller that displays JSP pages. The other is a controller that handles Ajax requests (AjaxController). I have a session attribute that is simply an object that has a HashMap as a member. The object is a wrapper around the map. The map is populated from the database and put in the session, which displays fine via the ViewController. However, when I do a delete from the map via an ajax request (AjaxController) and refresh the page, ViewController SOMETIMES shows that the element is removed, yet other times the element is still there. Here's code snippets:</p>

<p><strong>ViewController</strong> (the homepage simply displays the contents of the map contained by userSettings</p>

<pre><code>@Controller
@SessionAttributes({""userSettings""})
public class ViewController {

@RequestMapping(value=""/"", method=RequestMethod.GET)
    public String home(ModelMap model) {
        UserSettings userSettings = (UserSettings) model.get(""userSettings"");
        String userListenersJson = userSettings.toJson();  // for bootsrtapping the js on the front end

        return ""views/home"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>AjaxController:</p>

<pre><code>@Controller
@SessionAttributes({""userSettings""})
public class AjaxController {

@RequestMapping(value=""/users/listeners/{externalId}"", method=RequestMethod.DELETE)
public @ResponseBody
AjaxResponse&lt;?&gt; deleteListener(ModelMap model,
        @PathVariable long externalId) {

            UserSettings userSettings = (UserSettings) model.get(""userSettings"");
            userSettings.removeSetting(externalId);
            return new AjaxResponse&lt;String&gt;(null, true);    
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Am I using @SessionAttributes wrong here? Why would this work sometimes and not others? I've also tried putting all of the view and ajax functionality in the same controller and experienced the same behavior.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I've refactored my code a bit to use the UserPrincipal via springsecurity. My understanding is that this object is stored in the session. Regardless, I'm seeing exactly the same behavior.</p>

<p>Here's the UserPrincipal constructor that populates the user settings map. I've set breakpoints here to ensure that the correct listenerDBOs are set - they are, every time. This is the only time the listeners get set from the db into the UserSettings object in CustomUserPrincipal. All other adds/removes are done via the controllers (quick aside: adds never fail... only removes):</p>

<pre><code>public CustomUserPrincipal(UserDBO userDBO) {
    // set UserSettings obj
    UserSettingsAdapter.addListeners(userDBO.getUserListenerDBOs(), userSettings);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The UserSettings object itself:</p>

<pre><code>public class UserSettings implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = -1882864351438544088L;
    private static final Logger log = Logger.getLogger(UserSettings.class);

    private Map&lt;Long, Listener&gt; userListeners = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap&lt;Long, Listener&gt;(1));

    // get the listeners as an arraylist
    public List&lt;Listener&gt; userListeners() {
        return new ArrayList&lt;Listener&gt;(userListeners.values());
    }

    public Map&lt;Long, Listener&gt; getUserListeners() {
        return userListeners;
    }

    public Listener addListener(Listener listener) {
        userListeners.put(listener.getId(), listener);
        return listener;
    }

    // I'm logging here to try and debug the issue. I do see the success
    // message each time this function is called
    public Listener removeListener(Long id) {
        Listener l = userListeners.remove(id);
        if (l == null) {
            log.info(""failed to remove listener with id "" + id);
        } else {
            log.info(""successfully removed listener with id "" + id);
        }

        log.info(""Resulting map: "" + userListeners.toString());
        log.info(""Map hashcode: "" + userListeners.hashCode());

        return l;
    }


    public Listener getListener(long id) {
        return userListeners.get(id);
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This is the helper function in the UserSettingsAdapter class that adds to the UserSettings object, called from CustomUserDetails constructor:</p>

<pre><code>public static void addListeners(Set&lt;UserListenerDBO&gt; userListeners, UserSettings userSettings) {
    for (UserListenerDBO userListenerDBO : userListeners) {
        if (userListenerDBO.isActive()) {
            addListener(userListenerDBO, userSettings);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've also changed the controller code to user the CustomUserPrincipal object instead of @SessionAttributes:</p>

<p>In ViewController:</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value=""/"", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public String home(ModelMap model) {
   CustomUserPrincipal userPrincipal = authenticationHelpers.getUserPrincipal();
   UserSettings userSettings = userPrincipal.getUserSettings();
   String userListenersJson = userSettings.toJson();
   return ""views/home"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>In AjaxController:</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value=""/users/listeners/{externalId}"", method=RequestMethod.DELETE)
public @ResponseBody
AjaxResponse&lt;?&gt; deleteListener(ModelMap model,
        @PathVariable long externalId) {
   CustomUserPrincipal userPrincipal = authenticationHelpers.getUserPrincipal();
   UserSettings userSettings = userPrincipal.getUserSettings();
   userSettings.removeListener(externalId);

   return new AjaxResponse&lt;String&gt;(null, true); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this helps shed some light on the issue!</p>

<p>Essentially, I have an scientific computing application running a Monte Carlo simulation. The top-level for-loop I have parallelized using OpenMP. Each iteration of my for-loop performs a numerical integration of a initial-value problem and then subsequently writes the results to an SQLite database. To ensure that I don't have problems with writing to the file, I have an OpenMP-critical region defined for the writing-to-file, to ensure that the threads only do this one-by-one.</p>

<p>Everything seems to be working fine when I run my Monte Carlo simulation for 1,000 samples. I've tried to now increase it to 10,000 and for some reason, I seem to be randomly getting an ""unable to open database file"" error. This is particularly odd, because prior to this error, the application is successfully writing my simulation output to the database.</p>

<p>I've tried to look for a pattern and it does seem that the error occurs after roughly 1000 simulations are completed (not exactly, but somewhere in the region of 1000-1100 simulations).</p>

<p>I'm not really sure how I can pinpoint the source of the error and as a consequence, I can't determine if it's something inherent in my code, or if there's maybe some sort of maximum limit in SQLite that I'm hitting.</p>

<p>The code itself is fairly extensive, so I'm not sure it makes a lot of sense to post it here. In short, my code is doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>int main( int argc, char* argv[ ] )
{
  // Input deck, defining input parameters, including number of simulations to run ...

  // For-loop parallelization ...
#pragma omp parallel for num_threads( inputFileData.numberOfThreads ) schedule( guided )
  for ( int i = 0; i &lt; inputFileData.numberOfSimulations; i++ )
  {
    // Numerical integration execution ...

    #pragma omp critical( writeToDatabase )
    {
        // Database opening, population with results, and closing ....
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know this might not be very useful, but I am right now wondering if there is something in SQLite itself that I might be unaware of that might be causing this problem. I've looked through my code over and over and can't for the life of me figure out where it could be coming from in my code, if it is indeed due to my code implementation.</p>

<p>I hope someone might be able to help me sort this out.</p>

<p>I can post more code details if that's necessary to make headway with this.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>That is, ignoring the primary key (in this case <code>meow</code>), don't return the records that exist identically in both databases.</p>

<p>The table <code>foo</code> in <code>db1</code> looks like:</p>

<pre><code>meow    mix    please   deliver
1       123    abc
2       234    bcd      two
3       345    cde
</code></pre>

<p>And the table <code>foo</code> in <code>db2</code> looks like:</p>

<pre><code>meow    mix    please   deliver
1       345    cde
2       123    abc      one
3       234    bcd      two     
4       456    def      four
</code></pre>

<p>So the unique entries from <code>db2</code> are:</p>

<pre><code>[(2, 123, 'abc', 'one'), (4, 456, 'def', 'four')]
</code></pre>

<p>which is what I get. This works great if I have more than two columns. But if there are only two, i.e. a primary key and a value such as in a lookup table:</p>

<pre><code>bar  baz         bar   baz
1    123         1     234
2    234         2     345
3    345         3     123
                 4     456
</code></pre>

<p>I get all non-unique values repeated N-1 times and unique values repeated N times, where N is the number of records in <code>db1</code>. I understand why this is happening but I don't know how to fix it.</p>

<pre><code>[(1, '234'),
 (1, '234'),
 (2, '345'),
 (2, '345'),
 (3, '123'),
 (3, '123'),
 (4, '456'),
 (4, '456'),
 (4, '456')]
</code></pre>

<p>One idea I had was to just take the modulus after pulling all the duplicate results:</p>

<pre><code>N = db1.execute(""SELECT Count(*) FROM foo"").fetchone()[0]
data = [
     list(data) 
     for data,n in itertools.groupby(sorted(data)) 
     if np.mod(len(list(n)),N)==0
]
</code></pre>

<p>Which does work:</p>

<pre><code>[[4, '456']]
</code></pre>

<p>But this seems messy and I'd like to do it all in that first SQL query if possible.</p>

<p>Also, on large tables (my real db has ~10k records) this takes a long time. Any way to optimize this? Thanks!</p>

<p>Or I will be half way through my break points and the cursor will jump back to the previous breakpoint and and get stuck in a loop, again always jumping back to the previous break point.</p>

<p>It seems the debugger is not consistent either sometimes it will work fine and other times it will do as described above.</p>

        return posts;           
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I have this output (only first item is returned, the other two are empty):<br/>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JLm0h.png"" alt=""not working""></p>

<p>In both cases (with include or not), the Controller method returns a valid <code>List&lt;Post&gt;</code> that has all the items. However, with Include version, the list values (except the first value) do not show up in ajax/jquery side. </p>

<p>Do you think I am missing something?</p>

<p>Ideally I want a small form that allows a selection of advance type (academic, athletic) that will allow me to add students below it. Each student would be recorded in the course_advance_types_students table that is created for the HABTM association.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;select&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;academic&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;athletic&lt;/option&gt;

<p>If I comment out the eventCounter.Wait() statement, the calls work, but I have no way of knowing when they complete. This is a winforms app, so as long as I keep the form running, all the calls complete. But if I uncomment the eventCounter.Wait() statement, no calls get processed. It appears that the Wait() statement is blocking the async calls to start with. Every example I have found uses this approach, but none of them are signaling the CountdownEvent in the completed event handler. Thoughts?</p>

<h2>Edit - More Info</h2>

<p>Ok so the application looks like this:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/FiAhi.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>the full code block for the Import Data Button is:</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub Data_Import()

    Windows(ddlOpenWorkBooks.Value).Activate
    Columns(""A:V"").Select
    Selection.Copy
    Omni_Data.Activate
    Range(""A1"").Select
    ActiveSheet.Paste

    Omni_Data.Range(""A:Z"").Interior.ColorIndex = 0
    Omni_Data.Range(""A:Z"").Font.Name = ""Segoe UI""
    Omni_Data.Range(""A:Z"").Font.Name = ""Segoe UI""
    'Setting Background Colour to white and changing font

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>The above Sub is called on Click Event for the button.</p>

<p>As a test the close button has the following code:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub cmdCancel_Click()
    MsgBox (ddlOpenWorkbooks.Value)
    End

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Which works fine:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/hHtYv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>So we have found the problem.</p>

<p>As this is being called from a module it didn't know where ddlOpenWorkbooks was and where to pull that data from. </p>

<p>The corrected code in the Sub is:</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub Data_Import()

    Windows(frmOmniDataManipulation.ddlOpenWorkbooks.Value).Activate
    Columns(""A:V"").Select
    Selection.Copy
    Omni_Data.Activate
    Range(""A1"").Select
    ActiveSheet.Paste

    Omni_Data.Range(""A:Z"").Interior.ColorIndex = 0
    Omni_Data.Range(""A:Z"").Font.Name = ""Segoe UI""
    Omni_Data.Range(""A:Z"").Font.Name = ""Segoe UI""
    'Setting Background Colour to white and changing font

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow me to call the sub.</p>

<p>Hence I'm trying to use Node.JS (which I haven't used till date) to handle connections to the server. I've been through the <a href=""http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/eventsource/basics/"">HTML5 Rocks introduction to SSE</a> and there is a code sample integrating SSEs with Node.JS.</p>

<p>However, I'm confused as to whether Node.JS will handle the thousands of client connections concurrently and <b>utilize the server more efficiently than an Apache server</b>? Can anyone help me understand how exactly Node will act here?</p>

It was really simple to parse and extract data from the required binary files because of their simple structure (though I have to say it was unusual rather than the simple way C/C++; also as far as I digged into it, .NET does not support the values stored in reverse order [sure I can be wrong]). There are a lot of problems that are more complex and they require more flexible way of parsing, so I tried to google for some libraries that allow to process complex data structures and to describe them in declarative way with structure and fields attributes. At this moment I found a Java framework Preon only (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/644737/are-there-any-java-frameworks-for-binary-file-parsing"">here</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/985531/structure-validation-for-binary-files"">here</a>). I see that Preon is pretty good for these problems, it allows to describe data structure declaratively making it very flexible, but are there any ports or analogues of Preon for .NET?</p>

Table #2 is a breakdown of the files listed on those servers. This list can also include file paths that are not listed in table #1. Each file record is unique but the file names/paths/extension/modified date themselves are not.</p>

<p>Here, is the sample database picture that i would like to attach.
Visit this link to get the picture. ""<a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-JER42be41TSGJmVVV3bXJEcEk/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-JER42be41TSGJmVVV3bXJEcEk/view?usp=sharing</a>""</p>

<p>The main aim is to generate the data from the database and convert it into JSON data and populate the chart's ""dataProvider"" property/method with this JSON data in order to draw a chart.
Basically, the x-axis would contain the subjects and the y-axis would contain the marks secured by the student.</p>

<p>Now, I would like to know what is actually going wrong in the coding part. I would be really thankful to those who would share their valuable time in answering this question. 
Thank you so much.</p>

Simultaneously, I want to hide the fact that I've extended this fat class from end-users. Then I want to restrict that class with some new interface and let unneeded methods throw an <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class TooFatClass {
    public void usefulMethodOne() { ... };
    public void usefulMethodTwo() { ... };
    public void usefulMethodThree() { ... };
    ...
    public void notUsefulMethodOne() { ... };
    public void notUsefulMethodTwo() { ... };
    public void notUsefulMethodThree() { ... };
    ...
}

public interface OnlyUsefulMethods {
    public void usefulMethodOne();
    public void usefulMethodTwo();
    public void usefulMethodThree();
    ...

    public static OnlyUsefulMethods create() {
        return new OnlyUsefulMethodsImpl();
    }
}

// notice it is package-private
class OnlyUsefulMethodsImpl extends TooFatClass implements OnlyUsefulMethods {
    public void usefulMethodOne() { ... };
    public void usefulMethodTwo() { ... };
    public void usefulMethodThree() { ... };
    ...
    public void notUsefulMethodOne() { throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); };
    public void notUsefulMethodTwo() { throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); };
    public void notUsefulMethodThree() { throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); };
    ...        
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, <code>OnlyUsefulMethodsImpl</code> instance <em>can</em> be cast to <code>TooFatClass</code> if user really wants, but it hides this fact and do not forces user to do so. </p>

<p>However, java do not allows static methods implementations in interfaces (it is dumb to make it <code>OnlyUsefulMethods</code> abstract, I think), so I finish with this smelly piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>public interface OnlyUsefulMethods {
    public void usefulMethodOne();
    public void usefulMethodTwo();
    public void usefulMethodThree();
    ...

    public static final class Factory {
        public static OnlyUsefulMethods create() { return new OnlyUsefulMethodsImpl(); }
        public static OnlyUsefulMethods create(Options options) { 
               return new OnlyUsefulMethodsImpl(options); }
    }    

}
</code></pre>

<p>Even if I'll move a <code>Factory</code> outside of interface it looks too complex to use just for one class case, I want a factory method without showing <code>OnlyUsefulMethodsImpl</code> outside.</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong / too complex and missing some <em>restricting</em> pattern?</p>

<li>Two or move videos can play within a stream. Ex: a splash screen followed by the actual video content</li>

<p>and my question are all the release calls are correct (from 1 to 4) and if not what is right and what is not. or another phrase when the NSArray (given the fact that it has been initialized with an NSMutableArray) retains the objects and when it doesn't?</p>

<p>thanks in advance.</p>

Through some intro books, online blogs and of course many a Stack overflow page I have gotten it to a pretty good point. All except being able to reset my alarms when the phone reboots.</p>

<p>I have a BroadcastReceiver class which handles my alarms currently, and have given it the correct permissions in my manifest to handle 'RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED'. However when I reset the phone, no matter when that alarm was set it will fire straight after boot and have details of null.</p>

<p>I have found pages such as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4459058/alarm-manager-example"">this</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17941371/repeating-alarm-manager-after-reboot"">this</a>, but I am unsure of how to get a calendar object and instantiate it with the original values of each alarm then pass that to my receiver to set the alarm again...</p>

<p>Here is what I have so far.</p>

    AlarmManager am = (AlarmManager) getSystemService(ALARM_SERVICE);

    // Pass alarm calendar to alarm manager

<p>I am storing these reminders in a SQLite database and have included an alarm column which stores the long value of the calendar time, eg: 20140129021559.</p>

<p>I have seen others use a cursor to 'queue' up their alarms on reboot which are sorted by time and will reset everything, but none had enough information for me to actually implement it.</p>

<p>Here is my queueAll() method from my SQLiteAdapter class which is used to populate a listview on the mains screen with all of my current reminders, and sort them based on date (in ascending order) - Could this also be used to fire off the alarms on phone reboot?</p>

<pre><code>public Cursor queueAll() {
    String[] columns = new String[]{KEY_ID, KEY_TITLE, KEY_NOTES, KEY_TIME, KEY_DATE, KEY_ALARM_ID, KEY_ALARM};
    return db.query(DB_TABLE, columns, null, null, null, null, KEY_ALARM);
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. As I said I am only just starting out with all of this and if you know of a better way to go about it please let me know.</p>

<p>Sorry for any duplication, but the similar pages that I have found just aren't specific enough to my scenario to help me get over the line.</p>

<p>Regards.</p>

<p>EDIT: I believe I have fixed this now.</p>

<p>For anyone else interested here is what I have done.</p>

<p>I changed my AlarmService class to just be a receiver in the manifest and not the action.BOOT_COMPLETED receiver, and created a seperate class called AutoStart which only handles checking for this flag on start, and then queues up all rows from the SQLite Database and sets the alarms again.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;receiver android:name="".AlarmReceiver""&gt;&lt;/receiver&gt;                                                                                                      
&lt;receiver android:name="".AutoStart""&gt;                                         
    &lt;intent-filter&gt;                                                          
        &lt;action android:name=""android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED""&gt;&lt;/action&gt;
    &lt;/intent-filter&gt;                                                         
&lt;/receiver&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code from AutoStart for now which checks the database and sets the alarms again.</p>

<pre><code>public class AutoStart extends BroadcastReceiver {
SQLiteAdapter db;

    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        db = new SQLiteAdapter(context);

        if (intent.getAction().equals(""android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED"")) {
            Cursor cursor = SQLiteAdapter.queueAll();
            while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
                    Date alarmDate = new Date(cursor.getLong(cursor.getColumnIndex(SQLiteAdapter.getKeyAlarm())));
                    Calendar aCal = Calendar.getInstance();
                    aCal.setTime(alarmDate);
                    String title = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex(SQLiteAdapter.getKeyTitle()));
                    String notes = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex(SQLiteAdapter.getKeyNotes()));
                    int alarmID = cursor.getInt(cursor.getColumnIndex(SQLiteAdapter.getAlarmID()));
                    AlarmUtils.setAlarm(title, notes, alarmID, context, aCal);
            }
        }
    }
}

<p>Decoding and encoding proceeds without errors, at the end I get valid video stream, but, it seems that in one of this steps I set Invalid data for decoder/encoder. I get only 1/4 part of image (top-left, as I understood) and it has invalid color and come color stripes. Maybe I set invalid strides and planes when encode  frame, or maybe my setting data for libjpeg decoder is incorrect.. Please ask questions about my code, I'll try to make some explanations for you. I explodes my brain.. Thank you.</p>

I then moved my client code into a win32 service running as SYSTEM. The client code is unable to get a server list in spite of trying the following:
1. I tried to enable ""Allow service to interact with desktop"" on Win7.
2. I have impersonated the user in the thread that tries to talk to the server.

<p>The idea is that there will be two distinct elements - a Controller window (laptop) and a Display window (second screen).  For example, a dude will press a button on the laptop window, and it'll change the Display window - or information typed in the laptop will show on the second display.  It sounds odd, but its for a game that someone wants to set up...........</p>

<p>Moreover, I tried cross domain requests with jQuery by James Padolsey <a href=""http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/cross-domain-requests-with-jquery/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/cross-domain-requests-with-jquery/</a>
It works, but I haven't parsed data I receive. This plug-in uses Yahoo Query Language, because of that, controlling the data is different and not easy. </p>

<p>Is there any way left to figure my problem out? Please help me!</p>

<p>Best wishes.</p>

But to which field am I supposed to look into?</p>

<p>Where can I find for example the first direct pointer? I thought it was stored in i_data  array (it is in ext3_inode_info). 
But for an ext4 inode when I examine the first entry in i_data, I get a sector address that is not remotely similar to the real sector holding the address of the first data block.</p>

<p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>

<p>==EDIT==</p>

<p>ok, so I seemed to have understood the basic problem. I have an extent-based ext4 file system. Wasn't aware of this change, and that this is enabled by default. So is there a simple way to extract the physical addresses of blocks by offset? I'm trying again as verification to look at the first physical block (logical 0), by looking at the first extent, but I get some gibberish numbers (though consistent and unique for every inode/file, so some progress was made).</p>

<p>What I understand so far is that the main difference about a server side and a client side language is that the first one needs to be interpreted by the server to be sent to browser and the second one doesn´t.</p>

<p>I've worked with Vaadin and I know that is a server side framework because the java code needs to be interpreted to HTML and Javascript to be sent to browser. But then I've read that GWT is a client side and I can't understand why because we design all the page elements with Java widgets and they need to be interpreted to HTML and Javacript right? So, shouldn't GWT be a server side framework?</p>

<p>And what about JSF? I'm working with Primefaces and I develop xhtml files that uses beans to get server information. That means that the xhml files are client side and the Java beans are server side right?</p>

<p>Everytime I center the location on watchPosition it reload the map. Maybe there is a way with overlays but Unfortunately, I lack the knowledge.</p>

<p>The best way would be using Geomarker from Google Maps Library Utilities. But the same here. I can't center it.</p>

So the problem is folders are not visible in itunes (in Windows they are visible but they cannot be selected anyway.) Hence is not possible to export all files or import a file inside folders</p>

<p>So, I wonder if its possible to simulate a file system using CoreData where folders can contain X subfolders and Y files. (Since iTunes does not support folders they have to be no real folders)</p>

<p>How can I model my data to accomplish this? </p>

<p>I want to automatically update the table and the map markers without reloading the whole page (I basically want to eliminate the flickr of the map tile layer, and the database is constantly being updated by some randomly generated data inside model.py), but I ran into the following problems.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strike>When I use <code>refresh()</code> on only the table div, somehow my whole
wrapper div gets recursively embedded inside my table div, and everything (both map and table) refreshes. </strike></p></li>
<li><p>I wrote an updateMarker() function to update my markers, but it doesn't seem to work. </p></li>
<li><p><strike>I have my setInterval time interval at 5 seconds, but the div doesn't actually refresh every 5 seconds. More like every 1/2 second or something way too fast.</strike></p></li>
<li><p>Since my app connects to OSM for the map tiles, is it possible for all these ""GET"" queries to eat up my bandwidth? After letting the program run for a while, I realized I could no longer load Google and the wifi was still good. After a little longer, localhost started crashing like crazy. I restarted my computer twice and checked the internet setting 5 times, and localhost still crashes when I have the map related scripts enabled. When I comment out the map part of the code, however, my localhost seems fine for the most part, just a bit choppy and problem#3 still stands.</p></li>
<li><p>EDIT: Adding to #4, every time I start runserver now (with map
related code), the terminal output gets stuck at <code>[14/Aug/2013
03:42:01] ""GET /static/js/jquery-1.10.2.min.map HTTP/1.1"" 404 1744</code>
and localhost just goes Aw, Snap. :(</p>

<p>MORE EDIT: IT JUST FIXED ITSELF??! I didn't do anything...</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The EDITED refresh AJAX code:</p>

<pre><code>function refresh() {
    $.ajax({
        url: '/#table',
        success: function(data) {
            $('#result').html(data); //adding an extra #result div to wrap #table
            setInterval(refresh, 5000); //actually setting the refresh rate to 5s...
        }
    });
}

setInterval(refresh, 5000);
</code></pre>

<p>EDITED <code>updateMarkers</code> inside my .js file, </p>

<pre><code>// group markers to a layer and add the layer to map
function updateMarkers(LatLngArray) {

    // if (myLayer){
    //  map.removeLayer(myLayer);
    // }
    $.ajax({
        url:'/#map',
        success: function(){
            for (i=1;i&lt;=LatLngArray.length;i++) {
                myIcon = L.icon({iconUrl: 'https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chst=d_map_pin_letter&amp;chld='+i+'|666699|FFFFFF'});
                layArray.push(L.marker([LatLngArray[i].lat, LatLngArray[i].lng], {icon: myIcon}).bindPopup('&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;[LatLngArray[i].lat, LatLngArray[i].lng}}]&lt;/center&gt;'));
            }
            myLayer = L.layerGroup(layArray);
            map.addLayer(myLayer);
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Another somewhat relevant question, I followed <a href=""http://switch2osm.org/using-tiles/getting-started-with-leaflet/"" rel=""nofollow"">OSM's Leaflet Guide</a> to try to set up ""marker showing while user panning"" feature, but it doesn't work. When I pan around the map, say starting from the US and move east until I see the US again, all of my markers that were on the US from the other side can no longer be seen. I literally just copied the code. Inside the <code>initmap()</code> function it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>function initmap() {
    // create the tile layer with correct attribution
    var osmUrl='http://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png';
    var osmAttrib='Map data © OpenStreetMap contributors';
    var osm = new L.TileLayer(osmUrl, {minZoom: 2, maxZoom: 15, attribution: osmAttrib});       

    // start the map centering around the mediterrean
    map = new L.Map('map', {
        center: new L.LatLng(37.16, 18.87),
        zoom: 2,
        layers: [osm]
    });

    askForPlots();
    map.on('moveend', onMapMove);
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I click an image from the gallery I would like it to display in a modal window.</p>

<p>My problem is, when I click the link, the modal window displays without the image. All the examples I've seen use images from the file system whereas my site uses images from a db via a byte array. I guess the fix may be to change the line of javascript that is assigning the source attribute on the modal image but I've tried various things here without a result. The problem can be seen at the following address: <a href=""http://wilhan.azurewebsites.net/Photo"" rel=""nofollow"">Problem page</a></p>

<p>I have read some articles on this topic already:
1. <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/ClassFile.doc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">The class File Format</a>
2. <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/library/it-haggar_bytecode/"" rel=""nofollow"">Java bytecode</a></p>

<p>These two articles gave a lot of information about bytecode. However, non of them actually talks about the way to reverse engineer it, like how a snap of code is able to be mapped back to an if condition block or a for loop.</p>

I don't know how to get this to build. I've been trying to get visual studio to build this for 4 days now, and I'm extremely frustrated. Essentially, I follow the steps <a href=""http://tulip.labri.fr/TulipDrupal/?q=node/1461"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, and then set the variables CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH AND CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH according to <a href=""http://tulip.labri.fr/TulipDrupal/?q=node/981"" rel=""nofollow"">these instructions</a>.</p>

<p>To get to where I'm at, all you have to do is <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/auber/files/tulip/tulip_4.3.0/tulip-4.3.0_src.zip/download"" rel=""nofollow"">download tulip</a>, and:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unzip it, create a separate build directory outside of this source directory</li>
<li>Open CMake-gui to the source and build directories</li>
<li>Hit configure. Check use qt5, tell it where qmake is (make sure it's qt5)</li>
<li>You need some dependencies as described in The Independent CMake tutorial. Grab all those dependencies</li>
<li>As you continue to hit configure, specify each of the directories that it asks for as it errors out. It should ask for freetype, glew, zlib and sphinx. It shouldn't ask for where libxml or libpng, or libjpeg are. I don't know why it doesn't ask for those.</li>
<li>Generate, and then browse to the ALL_BUILD that you've generated. Open it with visual studio</li>
<li>try to build it with visual studio.</li>
</ol>

<p>In those instructions and in the process of getting CMake to generate the visual studio build files, it specifically asks for freetype's location. But in my build, it doesn't have a clue how to link the freetype library.</p>

<p>I know that many people aren't going to want to exactly try and go about replicating the build environment, so I've uploaded my build directory to dropbox. You can pull the entire thing down, and then open it in cmake gui and open the visual studio files in there too.

<p>I've tried enclosing inside </p>

<pre><code>using(Graphics g = new Graphics)

<p>since I've read that when doing edits on an image, you need to use graphics. but nothing is happening obviously since the api isn't using the graphic object I instantiated.</p>

<p>[Env: graphviz 2.38, Windows 7]</p>

<p>I'm working on a project to create path diagrams for structural equation models in R with the <a href=""https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=245"" rel=""nofollow"">sem</a> package
The sem package contains a function, pathDiagram, that does this reasonably well, by constructing the required code for dot.</p>

<p>We use two back-end renderers: dot itself, with -Tpdf, and the R <a href=""https://github.com/rich-iannone/DiagrammeR"" rel=""nofollow"">DiagrammeR package</a>, that uses javascript libraries grViz and mermaid.</p>

<p>We recently added code to allow rendering edge labels using greek letters and subscripts, by
using the UTF-8 character equivalents, eg</p>

<pre><code>""beta"" ""&amp;#946;"" ""&amp;#x3B2;""
""gamma"" ""&amp;#947;"" ""&amp;#x3B3;""
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>subscripts &lt;- c(""₀"", ""₁"", ""₂"", ""₃"", ""₄"", ""₅"", ""₆"",
""₇"", ""₈"", ""₉"")
</code></pre>

<p>We find that this works perfectly with DiagrammeR. With dot, we <em>do</em> get the Greek letters, but
nothing we have tried allows us to get subscripts from the standard command
dot -T pdf -o file.pdf file.dot
All we get are those little boxes with the 4-digit character code.</p>

<p>Is this a bug or limitation of dot? Is there any work-around?</p>

<p>Here is an example of a dot file generated by our software that illustrates this behavior.</p>

<p>I am writing an accounting system that works on the double-entry principal -- money always moves between accounts, a transaction is 2 or more <code>TransactionParts</code> rows decrementing one account and incrementing another.</p>

<p>Some <code>TransactionParts</code> rows may be flagged as tax related so that the system can produce a report of total VAT sales/purchases etc, so it is possible that a single Transaction may have two <code>TransactionParts</code> referencing the same Account -- one VAT related, and the other not.  To simplify presentation to the user, I have a view to combine multiple rows for the same account and transaction:</p>

<pre><code>create view Accounting.CondensedEntryView as
select p.[Transaction], p.Account, sum(p.Amount) as Amount
    from Accounting.TransactionParts p 
    group by p.[Transaction], p.Account
</code></pre>

<p>I then have a view to calculate the running balance column, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>create view Accounting.TransactionBalanceView as
with cte as
(
    select ROW_NUMBER() over (order by t.[Date]) AS RowNumber, 
                         t.ID as [Transaction], p.Amount, p.Account
        from Accounting.Transactions t
            inner join Accounting.CondensedEntryView p on p.[Transaction]=t.ID
)
select b.RowNumber, b.[Transaction], a.Account, 
                coalesce(sum(a.Amount), 0) as Balance
    from cte a, cte b
    where a.RowNumber &lt;= b.RowNumber AND a.Account=b.Account
    group by b.RowNumber, b.[Transaction], a.Account
</code></pre>

<p>For reasons I haven't yet worked out, a certain transaction (ID=30) doesn't appear on an account statement for the user.  I confirmed this by running</p>

<pre><code>select * from Accounting.TransactionBalanceView where [Transaction]=30
</code></pre>

<p>This gave me the following result:</p>

<pre><code>RowNumber            Transaction Account Balance
-------------------- ----------- ------- ---------------------
72                   30          23      143.80
</code></pre>

<p>As I said before, there should be at least two <code>TransactionParts</code> for each Transaction, so one of them isn't being presented in my view.  I assumed there must be an issue with the way I've written my view, and run a query to see if there's anything else missing:</p>

<pre><code>select [Transaction], count(*) 
    from Accounting.TransactionBalanceView 
    group by [Transaction] 
    having count(*) &lt; 2
</code></pre>

<p>This query returns no results -- not even for Transaction 30!  Thinking I must be an idiot I run the following query:</p>

<pre><code>select [Transaction] 
    from Accounting.TransactionBalanceView 
    where [Transaction]=30
</code></pre>

<p>It returns two rows!  So <code>select *</code> returns only one row and <code>select [Transaction]</code> returns both.  After much head-scratching and re-running the last two queries, I concluded I don't have the faintest idea what's happening.  Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot if you've stuck with me this far!</p>

<p>Here are the execution plans:</p>

<p><a href=""http://sites.google.com/site/gordonml89/select_all.sqlplan"" rel=""nofollow"">select *</a><br>
<a href=""http://sites.google.com/site/gordonml89/select_transaction.sqlplan"" rel=""nofollow"">select [Transaction]</a></p>

<p>1000 lines each, hence finding somewhere else to host.</p>

<h3>Edit 2:</h3>

<p>For completeness, here are the tables I used:</p>

<pre><code>create table Accounting.Accounts

<p>The problem is that although this changes the offset right away (proven by logs after the animation is complete), it doesn't change the visible scroll location. This is further proven by subsequent delegate methods of my scroll view which indicate that the bounds have indeed not changed at all. Meaning that the y location is not 0.</p>

<p>Is it forbidden to change the content offset in this particular delegate method? If so, when is it possible for me to change the offset? I'm trying to perform an animation of returning the visible scroll area to the top once the user finishes dragging (after a certain amount).</p>

Here's my clunky analogy: If you imagine the original collection is a zoo, I need a new collection that contains all the keys Zebras have, all the keys Lions have, and all the keys Giraffes have. The different animal types share many of the same keys, but those keys are meant to be specific to each type of animal (because the user needs to be able to (for example) search for Zebras taller than 3ft and giraffes shorter than 10ft).</p>

<p>Here's a bit of example code that I ran which worked well - it grabbed all the unique keys in my entire collection and threw them into their own collection:</p>

<pre><code>db.runCommand({
  ""mapreduce"" : ""MyZoo"",
  ""map"" : function() {
    for (var key in this) { emit(key, null); }
  },
  ""reduce"" : function(key, stuff) { return null; },
  ""out"": ""MyZoo"" + ""_keys""
})
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like a version of this command that would look through the <code>MyZoo</code> collection for animals with <code>""type"":""zebra""</code>, find all the unique keys, and place them in a new collection (<code>MyZoo_keys</code>) - then do the same thing for <code>""type"":""lion""</code> &amp; <code>""type"":""giraffe""</code>, giving each <code>""type""</code> its own array of keys.</p>

<p>Here's the collection I'm starting with:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""name"": ""Zebra1"",
    ""height"": ""300"",
    ""weight"": ""900"",
    ""type"": ""zebra""
    ""zebraSpecific1"": ""somevalue""
},
{
    ""name"": ""Lion1"",
    ""height"": ""325"",
    ""weight"": ""1200"",
    ""type"": ""lion"",
},
{
    ""name"": ""Zebra2"",
    ""height"": ""500"",
    ""weight"": ""2100"",
    ""type"": ""zebra"",
    ""zebraSpecific2"": ""somevalue""
},
{
    ""name"": ""Giraffe"",
    ""height"": ""4800"",
    ""weight"": ""2400"",
    ""type"": ""giraffe""
    ""giraffeSpecific1"": ""somevalue"",
    ""giraffeSpecific2"": ""someothervalue""
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here's what I'd like the <code>MyZoo_keys</code> collection to look like:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""zebra"": [
        {
            ""name"": null,
            ""height"": null,
            ""weight"": null,
            ""type"": null,
            ""zebraSpecific1"": null,
            ""zebraSpecific2"": null
        }
    ],
    ""lion"": [
        {
            ""name"": null,

            ""weight"": null,
            ""type"": null

I am about to install node.js alongside apache and geoserver for a web-mapping project, I'll use node.js just to handle websockets. In practice, coding-wise, I'm more experienced with php and its hard for me to shift my logic from traditional xml-http-requests, but I'll give it a shot.</p>

<p>Some questions, before I dig in. I use postgreSQL/postGIS, how can I perform database queries from node.js to postgreSQL/postGIS? I'm used to the traditional PHP queries like the following</p>

<pre><code> $stmt = $dbh-&gt;prepare(""SELECT pins.p_name FROM     pins
 WHERE type.t_id=pins.p_type AND
    AND p_id = :nm"");
$stmt-&gt;bindParam(':nm', $nm, PDO::PARAM_STR);
$nm=$jas;
$data=array('nm'=&gt;$nm);
$stmt-&gt;execute($data);
//blah blah
//(I always use PDO and prepared statements)
</code></pre>

<p>Most tutorials out there talk about chat apps, but what about queries and communicating with postgreSQL/postGIS? Is that possible in node.js/socket.io? Any tips/tutorials? I want to execute the query, gather the outcome, put some html tags and then push it back to the client, in a specific div.</p>

<p>Also, is node.js now working on windows 7, without a problem? In the past it did not, but I guess now it does, since they have an msi installer. Right?</p>

<p>You can toggle the two by changing which line is commented out. Note that the end of the lines differ from '$parent' to '$container'. If you set it to $container, you might have to run it a few times so that the parent loads last (if you get one or more '1-1' then that's the issue).</p>

Should I null the references to the unused layout items and let the GC work? Or should I recycle the image resources?</p>

It would be a game, you can see some proposed screenshots about it below. 
Basically There is an Activity, and I would like to put about 9-10 inflated layouts within the same activity. The main reason that I want to put these layouts into the same Activity is, that they logically cohere, and I would like to switch swiftly amongst them. </p>

<p>However these layout-views consumes lots of memory resources (because of the pictures and sounds - for example), and the memory is fill up with them. Unfortunatelly, for some reason, the GC doesn't help, though I tried to null the references of the layout-views.</p>

<li>Table View with Header and Footer because cells in between are static (static cells are only supported in a UITableViewController, not a UITableView in a normal UIViewController..)</li>
</ul>

<p>In IB I set the height of the UIImageView to 140. The image that I load into it is square.
I want to use scale to fill and see a portion of the image, as long as the entire UIImageView is filled. There is no way to use constraints on this header view, not in IB, not programatically (tried).</p>

<p>The issue is that probably because of Auto Layout, the UIImageView gets stretched until the image fits entirely in the UIImageView. In fact the image view is even stretched over the first couple of rows of the table view's body.</p>

<p>I need to find all first events of a particular season who do not have a referencing character. I came up with the SQL code to do it, but I would like to use Hibernate to map GameOfThronesEvent objects for me, and SQLQuery.list() will not do that.</p>

<p><strong>So, I either need to be cool and figure out how to get hibernate to map these for me (is this possible???), or be lame and use a manual <code>ResultTransformer</code>.</strong></p>

<p>Here's my sql if you want to try it yourself:</p>

<pre><code>create table GOT_EVENTS(event_id number(3) primary key,
                        description varchar2(50) not null,
                        season_nbr number(2) not null,
                        event_dt date not null)

create table GOT_CHARS(char_id number(3) primary key,
                       name varchar2(50) not null,
                       event_id number(3) references GOT_EVENTS(event_id) not null)
</code></pre>

<p>This is the bit I need to represent with hibernate, either in Criteria or HQL so it will map the stuff from got_events into GameOfThronesEvent objects.</p>

<pre><code>with ranked_events as
 (select e.*,
         ROW_NUMBER() over(partition by e.season_nbr order by e.event_dt) as rk
    from got_events e)
select c.*, re.*
  from ranked_events re
  left outer join got_chars c
    on re.event_id = c.event_id
 where c.event_id is null
   and re.rk = 1;

<p>i have a table called List, this has 32000 rows, 2000 for each year(1999-2014) which has columns: SongID,Top2000Year,Position,</p>

<p><strong>What has to happen:</strong></p>

<p>if someone deletes for example the year 2000, all 2000 songs of the year 2000 will be deleted, theres no problem with that</p>

<pre><code>Delete from List WHERE top2000Year = 2000
</code></pre>

<p>But, the problem i am facing is: i need this to be logged, i created a log table called LogTable with the columns: Title,Artist,Year,Position
Title will be the song title, year is the year the song came out and position is the position in the list</p>

<p>those are from a different table, i join them like this</p>

<pre><code>select title, name[artist],song.Year[SongYear], position from List
left join Song on Song.songid = List.songid
left join Artist on Artist.artistid = Song.artistid
where top2000Year = 2013
order by position asc
</code></pre>

<p>this shows a query like this <a href=""http://puu.sh/i8f2u/8702ee7010.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://puu.sh/i8f2u/8702ee7010.png</a> (Censored the server, it's my teachers so i figured i'd censor it)</p>

<p>i am trying to fill my LogTable exactly like that, if the year 2013 is deleted, those 2000 rows should be inserted into the LogTable <strong>using a trigger</strong></p>

<p>Edit:
i used this <a href=""https://dbalink.wordpress.com/2008/06/20/how-to-sql-server-trigger-101/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dbalink.wordpress.com/2008/06/20/how-to-sql-server-trigger-101/</a> and it worked, then i tried it with my database, and it didn't work. </p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>USE [TOP2000DATABASE]

<p>I realized some searches on the internet and could not find an example and practice to my understanding, so I'm trying to create a simple code in Objective-c where we have a number to be sent to an existing .cpp file in my project, and the .cpp take that number and multiply it by 2, and then the .cpp file returns me the number multiplied to the Objective-c, and then I show the console.</p>

<p>Below is a small example of a part of code done in Objective-c:</p>

    [super viewDidLoad];

    int myNumber = 45;

    /*

    HERE COMES THE CODE WHO WILL SELECT THE FILE 'MULTI.CPP' AND SEND THE VAR 'MYNUMBER' TO

    int returnNumber = /*  HERE COMES A CODE THAT WILL GET THE NUMBER MULTIPLIED BY 2 */


}

<p>So..I have no idea to do this kind of thing, but for me I think it's a very simple thing to do. I do not know if this is the correct way to send parameters of Objective-C to C, I thought this way because I'm used to send parameters of Objective-C for PHP, and in it you can send an easy way.</p>

<p>As you guys saw my code is incomplete, in my case what are the commands that could be placed there so the number <strong>'45'</strong> can be sent to for a .cpp project, and then after processing be sent back to the objetive- c?</p>

<p>I am calling the dll via Python using ctypes as described in the answers to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/239020/how-can-i-call-a-dll-from-a-scripting-language"">How can I call a DLL from a scripting language?</a></p>

<p>Within the dll I'm able to successfully determine the calling process using WINAPI GetModuleFileName() <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683197(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683197(v=vs.85).aspx</a>.  However, since this is a Python script it's being run via the Python executable thus the returned module file name is ""C:/Python33/Python.exe"".  I'm needing the name of the actual script file doing the call.  Is this possible?</p>

<p>A bit of background on why: this dll is used for authentication.  It's generating a hash using a shared secret key for the script to use to authenticate an HTTP request.  It's embedded in the dll so that people using the script won't see the key.  We want to make sure the python file calling the script is signed so not just anyone can use this dll to generate a signature, so getting the filepath of the calling script is the first step.</p>

<p>When there is a framerate hiccup, you can see that suddenly the skew exceeds itself - that is, if it should be at <code>2.0f</code>, it looks like it is at <code>50.0f</code> or something. If you wait a bit, it stabilises alright.</p>

<p>I suspect it is due to a framerate hiccup because it happens in the following scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the phone is locked and then unlocked.</li>
<li>The application comes to foreground from the background.</li>
<li>The map scene was frozen in the Director's scene stack (because I used <code>pushScene</code>) and then it was resumed (by calling <code>popScene</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn't happen always. I've seen it occur in iPhones 4 and 5 - as well as iPads.</p>

<p>Is it possible to reuse that certificate to sign jars?</p>

<p>Can someone explain me, how to use this VeriSign certificate with Oracle's jarsigner to sign jar files?</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Steps I followed:</p>

<p>Step 1. Create key store
keytool -genkey -keyalg rsa -keystore  MYStore.ks -alias mySelf -keysize 2048</p>

<p>keystore pw : 4804994
mySelf  pw: abcdef</p>

<p>Step 2. Import Verisign certificate to key store</p>

<p>keytool -importcert -file MSCV-VSClass3.cer -keystore MYStore.ks</p>

<p>This displays certificate info and ask; Trust this certificate ? [no] : yes</p>

<p>Certificate was added to keystore.</p>

<p>Step 3.
jarsigner -keystore MYStore.ks TestRun.jar mySelf</p>

<p>Warning: signer certificate will expire within six months.</p>

<p>Now I wanted to verify the signed jar.</p>

<p>jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs TestRun.jar</p>

<p>Warning:
This jar contain entries whose signer certificate will expire within six months.
This jar contain entries whose certificate chain is not validated.</p>

<p>As I understand, key store does not have the private key of the public key in the certificate.</p>

<p>How to solve this issue?</p>

<p>text.text holds the string to write, text.x holds the value for the x position, and text.y holds the value for the y position</p>

<p>Is there anyway I could skip the text.text property?</p>

textStrings[0].x = 0;
textStrings[0].y = 10;

<p>basically a default property of an object or something...</p>

<p>right now as soon as I do something like </p>

2    GROUPB                      
</code></pre>

<p>How is it possible to get the count for unique records in each group, as well as how many IDs are overlapped between groups? like:</p>

<pre><code>#         Unique To Group    Overlap with others     Uniques not in group
------    ---------------    -------------------     -------------------
GROUPA          1                    2                     1

</code></pre>

<p>So overlap is by the ID:</p>

<ul>
<li>if ID is unique to GROUP - then unique to Group</li>
<li>if ID is repeated in other groups then it is an overlap</li>
<li>if ID is not present in group but present in others - it is unique not in group</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently I am thinking of doing this in a loop like:</p>

<pre><code>GROUPA = df[which(df$Group == 'A'), ]
for (id in df$id) {
  if is.element(id, GROUPA):
    GroupACount &lt;- GroupACount+1
etc
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure how to do the overlap though. But is there a better way maybe with apply and %in%? </p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

I’m aware this is quite an involved question so please bear with me! I think I’ve managed to get it down to two specifics:- I need two loops which I can’t seem to get working…
Firstly; The variable rollers(1).ink is a (12x1) vector containing ink values. This program shares the ink equally between rollers at each connection. I’m attempting to get rollers(1).ink to interact with rollers(2) only at specific timesteps. The ink should transfer into the system once for every full revolution i.e. nTimesSteps = each multiple of nBins_max. The ink should not transfer back to rollers(1).ink as the system rotates – it should only introduce ink to the system once per revolution and not take any back out. Currently I’ve set rollers(1).ink = ones but only for testing. I’m truly stuck here!
Secondly; The reason it needs to do this is because at the end of the sim I also wish to remove ink in the form of a printed image. The image should be a reflection of the ink on the last roller in my system and half of this value should be removed from the last roller and taken out of the system at each revolution. The ink remaining on the last roller should be recycled and ‘re-split’ in the system ready for the next rotation.
So…I think it’s around the loop beginning line86 where I need to do all this stuff. In pseudo, for the intermittent in-feed I’ve been trying something like:</p>

<pre><code>For k = 1:nTimeSteps
While nTimesSteps = mod(nTimeSteps, nBins_max) == 0 % This should only output when nTimeSteps is a whole multiple of nBins_max i.e. one full revolution
‘Give me the ink on each segment at each time step in a matrix’
End
</code></pre>

<p>The output for averageAmountOfInk is the exact format I would like to return this data except I don’t really need the average, just the actual value at each moment in time. I keep getting errors for dimensional mismatches when I try to re-create this using something like:</p>

<pre><code>For m = 1:nTimeSteps
    For n = 1:N
Rollers(m,n) = rollers(n).ink’;
    End
End
</code></pre>

<p>I’ll post the full code below if anyone is interested to see what it does currently. There’s a function at the end also which of course needs to be saved out to a separate file.
I’ve posted variations of this question a couple of times but I’m fully aware it’s quite a tricky one and I’m finding it difficult to get my intent across over the internets!
If anyone has any ideas/advice/general insults about my lack of programming skills then feel free to reply!</p>

<p>For example, if I have a class called Car and a guage control called RPM, how do I tie the value of RPM to the member variable Car.RPM, so that when Car.RPM changes, it is automatically (as in without a specific update call coded by me) reflected by the RPM control?</p>

<p>I have thousands of deployed autonomous sensor devices recording data.</p>

<p>Each sensor device essentially reports a couple of values four times an hour each day, over months and years. I need to keep all of this data for historic statistical analysis. Generally, it is write once, read many times. Server-based applications run regularly to query the data to infer other information.</p>

<p>The rows of data today, in SQL look something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>(id, device_id, utc_timestamp, value1, value2)</li>
</ul>

<p>Our existing MySQL solution is not going to scale up much further, with tens of millions of rows. We query things like ""<em>tell me the sum of all the value1 yesterday</em>"" or ""<em>show me the average of value2 in the last 8 hours</em>"". We do this in SQL but can happily change to doing it in code. SimpleDBs ""eventual consistency"" appears fine for our puposes.</p>

<p>I'm reading up all I can and am about to start experimenting with our <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services"" rel=""nofollow"">AWS</a> account, but it's not clear to me how the various SimpleDB concepts (items, domains, attributes, etc.) relate to our domain.</p>

<p>Is SimpleDB an appropriate vehicle for this and what would a generalised approach be?</p>

<p>PS: We mostly use Python, but this shouldn't matter when considering this at a high level. I'm aware of the <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/boto/"" rel=""nofollow"">boto</a> library at this point.</p>

I did some search and found a build.bat in the PCbuild directory. I am trying to replicate what it does, by setting the path variables for Release|x64. However when I do that and execute it still tries to build make_versioninfo, make_buildinfo as ""Release|Win32"" instead of ""Release|x64"" this causes these two initial builds to break with the following error:                                                                                                                                                               </p>

<p>With respect to that behavior I assume that A in <code>//1</code> and in <code>//2</code> actually refers to the different entity. But during the name lookup process (3.4.1, unqualified name lookup) for the <code>A</code> the same <strong><em>injected class name</em></strong> will be found both in <code>//1</code> and in <code>//2</code>. It is very curious. </p>

<p>Can you explain that? </p>

It is mostly working, but I want the directive to be as compatible with other code as possible and it looks like it will not update a model that is attached to an input if it is being changed via the plugin.</p>

<p>I have tried calling $apply and $digest so that the scope might try to update, but the value in the model isn't changing.</p>

<p>The directive:</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('myApp.directives', []).
directive('skinned', function () {// Might need to cover all radios
    return {
        restrict: 'A',
        scope   : {

            var inputs = elem.find('input');

            var checkboxClass = 'icheckbox';
            var radioClass = 'iradio';

            if (scope.skinned) {

                radioClass    += '_' + scope.skinned;

            var options = {
                cursor        : true,
                checkboxClass : checkboxClass,
                radioClass    : radioClass,
                insert        : scope.skinnedInsert
            };

            inputs.iCheck(options);

            elem.on('ifChanged', function(event) { scope.$digest(); });

            scope.$watchCollection(
                function() { //The collection that will be checked for changes
                    var result = [];
                    inputs.each(function(index, el) {
                        result.push($(el).prop('checked'));

                    return result;

    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>I thought that I might be on the wrong scope and tried getting the scope via angular.element(event.target).scope(), but that didn't change anything.</p>

<p>The HTML</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul skinned=""flat-grey""&gt;
    &lt;li data-ng-click=""checktest = true""&gt;&lt;input id=""1"" type=""checkbox"" ng-model=""checktest"" /&gt;&lt;label for=""1""&gt;Label_1&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;input id=""2"" type=""checkbox"" /&gt;&lt;label for=""2""&gt;Label_2&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;input id=""3"" type=""checkbox"" /&gt;&lt;label for=""3""&gt;Label_3&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;input id=""4"" type=""checkbox"" /&gt;&lt;label for=""4""&gt;Label_4&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;input id=""5"" type=""checkbox"" /&gt;&lt;label for=""5""&gt;Label_5&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When updating the model via ng-click iCheck picks it up, but not the other way around.</p>

<p>Normally you would forward declare Management.h in the Worker header file, and call it a day.  Sadly, since the class is templated, it is always going to get included.</p>

<p>I guess you can claim that the design is bad, since a templated class shouldn't be templated if it needs to know this sort of information, but it is what it is, and I have to work with it. </p>

<pre><code>simplify_pretty(expand((ax + bx)^2 + (ay + by)^2))
</code></pre>

<p>...but when changed to...</p>

<pre><code>simplify_pretty(expand(-(ax + bx)^2 - (ay + by)^2))
</code></pre>

<p>...it doesn't</p>

<p>So the questions is:
Is it possible to create rules which work in (nearly) all situations? What am I doing wrong?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
This seems to be a general problem. If an expression has some kind of factor/is disarranged it seems to be quite hard for matlab to figure this out. I need a robust way to do this kind of stuff even if it takes some time to process.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong></p>

<p><em>What type of expressions I'm talking about?</em><br/>
The expressions contain only mathematical simple operations (add/sub/mul/div). </p>

<p><em>What do I want to get simplified?</em><br/>
One of the most common things I want to simplify are binomials which got expanded (see the original question). </p>

<p>Another common thing contained in the expressions expanded dot/cross products which could get simplified to cos(a)/sin(a) expressions which might get merged together in the next steps. But this is more advanced so I'm not sure if there are useful automatic solutions for it.</p>

<p><em>What is ""pretty"" in my case?</em><br/>
I guess most important is the length of the expressions (as shorter as better). But it would also be neat to optimize expressions like</p>

<pre><code>a/2 + b/2 + c/2
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>(a + b + c) / 2

There are some features that I am missing. My question: Is there an open-source library that does support these features, or is there anything remarkable in development? Or, do you have any smart hints on how to extend/use the validation framework to cover these features?</p>

<p>Missed features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For some fields I need to define ""warning"" rules rather than erros. If they evaluate to false, a message should be displayed but it should contain a link ""ignore"" that allows the user to turn off the rule (similar to MS Word's spellchecker where the user can choose to ignore a spelling error). If the validation prevented the form from being sent, ideally the form is immediately sent when the user clicks ""ignore"".</p></li>
<li><p>The rules should depend on the action I want to execute with the form. Whilst for one action the fields are not required yet they might be required to execute another action.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As an example for both cases, take a ""send e-mail"" form:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ""subject"" field is not necessarily required but if it is empty the user might have missed it. Ideally the validation framework blocks the form from being sent and displays a message such as ""You missed the subject. Ignore"". By clicking ""Ignore"" the message is disabled and the form is sent.</li>
<li>The ""to"" field is definitely required for sending the e-mail. But if the form provides a ""save draft"" button, the user should not be forced to fill in this field for saving the draft.</li>

"17158115","1","","","2013-06-17 22:48:47","","0","244","<h3>The Context</h3>

<p>I have a non-generic interface, <code>IInputEventProvider</code> that is implemented by a concrete class, <code>InputEventProvider&lt;TState, TInputEvent&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>In my installer, I register the concrete type four times with different generic type parameters like so:</p>

<pre><code>.Register(
    Component.For&lt;IInputEventProvider&gt;()
        .ImplementedBy&lt;InputEventProvider&lt;KeyboardState, KeyboardEvent&gt;&gt;(),
    Component.For&lt;IInputEventProvider&gt;()
        .ImplementedBy&lt;InputEventProvider&lt;MouseState, MouseButtonEvent&gt;&gt;(),
    Component.For&lt;IInputEventProvider&gt;()
        .ImplementedBy&lt;InputEventProvider&lt;MouseState, MouseMoveEvent&gt;&gt;(),
    Component.For&lt;IInputEventProvider&gt;()
        .ImplementedBy&lt;InputEventProvider&lt;MouseState, ScrollWheelEvent&gt;&gt;()
)
</code></pre>

<p>I also do a convention-based registration of all the classes in my assembly against their interfaces:</p>

<pre><code>.Register(
    Classes.FromAssemblyContaining&lt;MainClass&gt;()
        .Pick()
        .WithServiceAllInterfaces()
)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally in one of my classes I take a dependency on <code>IEnumerable&lt;IInputEventProvider&gt;</code>, which should return my four registered type instances.</p>

<h3>The Issue</h3>

<p>When resolving at my composition root, I get the following exception:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Requested type Exuinoq.Core.Input.IInputEventProvider has 0 generic
  parameter(s), whereas component implementation type
  Exuinoq.Core.Input.InputEventProvider`2[TState,TInputEvent] requires
  2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is because the convention-based registration in the installer has picked up the generic concrete class and registered it as a generic type, which then cannot be resolved.</p>

<h3>The Question</h3>

<p><strong>What is the best way to avoid this and prevent it happening to other classes in the future?</strong> The exception gives the following advice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can instruct Windsor which types it should use to close this
  generic component by supplying an implementation of
  IGenericImplementationMatchingStrategy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I think this only applies to when you wish to register a <em>single</em> type, not four different ones. I could be wrong though!</p>

<p>For the time being I have used this workaround but it is hardly sustainable:</p>

<pre><code>.Register(
    Classes.FromAssemblyContaining&lt;MyClass&gt;()
        .Where(t =&gt; !typeof(IInputEventProvider).IsAssignableFrom(t))
        .WithServiceAllInterfaces()
)

I've tracked it down to the texture2D() calls. However, without those any convolution shader is undoable. I've tried using lowp instead of mediump, but with that everything is just black, although it does give another 5fps, but it's still unusable.</p>

<p>Here is my fragment shader.</p>

<p>This is unoptimized, and not finalized, but I need to bring up performance before continuing on. I've tried replacing the texture2D() call in the loop with just a solid vec4 and it runs no problem, despite everything else going on.</p>

<p>How can I optimize this? I know it's possible because I've seen way more involved effects in 3D running no problem. I can't see why this is causing any trouble at all.</p>

<p>any way i tried always give compilation errors (<code>method must return boolean</code>).</p>

<h2>More Details Specific to my Scenario</h2>

<p>I am using the deployment method used by Yeoman generated projects. Basically meaning that I have an overall project folder within which there is a <code>dev</code>(or <code>app</code>) directory where all development is done and a <code>dist</code> directory which is where the project is built to(via gulp build process). So to deploy I just split the <code>dist</code> directory off into it's own branch and push that to the live server.</p>

<p>Which looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>gulp
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff dev
git subtree split -P dist -b dist
git push
</code></pre>

<p>Alternately <code>git subtree push -P dist origin dist</code> also works.</p>

<p>There is an app running on server, and it is connected to a SQL database.
On a client side computer, there is a windows service running, which periodically attempts to communicate with the app on the server.
The app then checks, using info from db, if there are any new items for this client service, and if there are, it sends links for download, which the service handles.</p>

<p>Now, my question is about the best way of communication between the app and the service in this scenario. I have read about MSMQ and NamedPipes, like in the article here:
<a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/846586/Queuing-Windows-Services-work-items-using-MSMQ-and"" rel=""nofollow"">Link to codeproject</a></p>

<p>I have been trying to use a component for a many-to-many table but I don't seem to find where to point the component to cause a join on a specific column. I guess as long as I populate the completion information object, the presence and usage of a component is not a requirement for me.</p>

<p>This is my simplified schema.</p>

<pre><code>User
...................
Id
Name 

Task
...................
Id
Name


Job
...................
Id
Name

JobTask
...................
JobId
TaskId
CompletedByUserId
CompletionDate
CompletionNotes
</code></pre>

<p>Then I have objects like so:</p>

<pre><code> public class Job
 {
    long Id { get; set; }
    IList&lt;Task&gt; Tasks { get; set; }
 }


 public class Task
 {
    long Id { get; set; }
    string Name { get; set; }
    CompletionInfo CompletionInfo { get; set; }
 }

 public class CompletionInfo
 {
    User User { get; set; }
    DateTime CompletionDate { get; set; }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Can you help with your ideas how to implement this in fluent nhibernate?</p>

<p>I had this mapping before on the JobMap and it would work but only for the many-to-many columns ( TaskId, JobId). I need the extra information related to that relationship(dateCompleted, userCompleted,etc)</p>

<pre><code> HasManyToMany&lt;Task&gt;(job =&gt; job.Tasks)
            .Table(ManyToManyTable)
             .ParentKeyColumn(""JobId"")
            .ChildKeyColumn(""TaskId"")
            .Not.LazyLoad()
            .Cascade.Delete();
</code></pre>

<p>In order to simplify things with the many-to many I thought to create an object to represent the relationship and encapsulate a task. Like so:
And I would add a proxy in the Job task to modify the actual Task properties. But that is not going anywhere.</p>

<p>This must be something common out there, I am very surprised there not much regarding this issue. 
Naturally I would have loved a way to extend the HasManyToMany but not sure how, hence this post.</p>

<pre><code>public class JobTask : Entity&lt;long, JobTask&gt;

<p>A client can happily add and remove child rows via the parent's collection getter and their changes are properly committed after an em.merge(parent).</p>

    //PersistenceUnitUtil.isLoaded(par) returns true
    //PersistenceUnitUtil.isLoaded(par, ""children"") returns false

par.getChildren().remove(child);
par.getChildren().add(new Child(par, ""I'm New""));
par.setName(""I am Updated"");
par=em.merge(par);

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>My intention is to create a web environment (behind a login) where webusers input or modify basic information stored in a MySQL database served via PHP scripts. Once the webuser submits the input data, it is written to a MySQL database, and a bash script is generated with the data then executed to run several programs in sequence on the Linux box.</p>

<p>The goal is to prevent inexperienced users from having to SSH into the Linux machine and edit text files manually to run certain software. The MySQL database is meant to store webuser info and data for each <em>case</em> they create.</p>

<h1>The Trouble</h1>

<p>I need some help on how to proceed from a security and functionality stand-point:</p>

<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong></p>

<p><code>shell_exec()</code> executes a bash script as the <code>apache</code> user which does not have the proper environment to execute the programs. This issue is described <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11296609/how-to-execute-a-program-from-a-php-web-page"">here</a> with no (clear) resolution.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Concerns</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>I cannot SSH into user <code>apache</code> to handle back-end administration of these <em>cases</em>. This is where executing the scripts as another user would be beneficial.</p></li>
<li><p>The shared back-end account is executed by every webuser meaning any data written could potentially be exposed to every webuser, which is not good; but I'm not sure of the extent of the security implications here.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>The Analysis</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>I feel that creating sessions using <code>ssh2_exec()</code> to execute the bash scripts on the back-end would alleviate the issue with #1 above. However, I don't want the webuser to have to maintain a persistent connection since some scripts may take hours to run. If they are connected, feedback on the progress is required, but they should be free to leave at any time.</p></li>
<li><p>I figure I can avoid any issues with data access on the back-end by just splitting up <em>cases</em> into subdirs by webuser or a var in the MySQL database. Say I save data in a dir-structure like <code>/CASES/webuser#/case#</code> or similar, then restricting webuser access to only their own subdir. Does this seem feasible?</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Questions</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Is either <code>ssh2_exec()</code> or <code>shell_exec()</code> better for what I'm attempting to accomplish?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a better method to separate and secure data on the back-end from different webusers?</p></li>
<li><p>Could I perhaps initialise a <code>ssh2_connect()</code> session when the user logs in so I can feed them updates, then terminate it when they manoeuvre away from the site? Would they have to manually log out when leaving to sever the connection?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Can anyone help/explain this ? The only way I have found out to be working is <code>:%s/class=/&amp;/g</code> but this is in my opinion a little overkill since it actually substitutes regex with the same characters tat have been found instead of just counting the occurrences.</p>

<p>I am using VIM 6.3</p>

<p>There are a couple of different attempts in the second code segment, neither of which displays the inspections that are downloaded from the server.  The node opened might not be selected so I think thats why the code at the end might not be working.  I also tried:</p>

<pre><code> jQuery.jstree._reference(""#explorer"").refresh(data.rslt.obj);
</code></pre>

<p>but this would stop the loading icon from appearing but no inspections would appear.</p>

<p>The goal is to be able to load sites dynamically, then when a site is expanded go get all the inspections for that site.</p>

<p>The same thing happens if I try to define the image manually. As far as I can tell the path to the image is correct. Also, I used something similar for a Django 1.7 project running on Python 2.7 without problems, so it might be something specific to Python 3.</p>

<p>Can anyone see where I've gone wrong here? I can create new Photo objects using the Django admin interface, so I don't think the problem is with the model, just with how I'm interacting with it in the tests.</p>

I have a data in notepad like this:</p>

10192 20207 30206 40203 50205 60226

<p>it's 26 line of data, but I only show 3 line just for example. Here's some rule sort by it's priority:</p>

<p>-I only want to read the text file then extract the number. Example : 10192 20351 so on.</p>

<p>-I have 6 column of ListView and I want to display each line of number in it's column</p>

  <p>Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |Column 4 | Column 5 | Column 6 </p>

<p>-off course if possible, The first 2 digit of each 5 digit of number is a unique code, all i want is just 3 last digit. For example: 192 351 473 499 234. so it's going to be mod by 10.000 for each number.</p>

<p>I am writing a server application that starts one <em>listening</em> thread, which should stay active the whole time while the server is up.
When the listening thread gets a <em>connect</em> request, it opens a CONTROL socket and starts a new <strong>control</strong> thread. 
This thread is used to send control data between server and a client, initializing server and all the background software to specific client data and starting data processing.</p>

<p>If the initialization (via control socket) is successful, the <strong>control</strong> thread will open a new socket, DATA socket, which is then used to pass data from server to client. It will also start two new threads, one which is sending on this new, DATA socket, and the other, which is receiving on the CONTROL socket, waiting if the client wants to terminate connection.</p>

<p>When client terminates connection ungracefully, by terminating application without the call to function which sends the server message to close the connection, here is what should happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any of the threads in execution can detect this event. They will get some sort of error (WSAECONNRESET) while sending or receiving on DATA/CONTROL socket and should then signal all the other threads that they should stop executing (except for the server listening thread).</li>
</ul>

<p>Which is the most natural way to achieve this type of behavior?</p>

<a href=""http://webapp.com/stages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webapp.com/stages</a></p>

<p>How can I have all my sources on just one directory on server-side (I suppose it's better to maintain, the resources are cached better, etc...) but with these 2 URLs pointing to the folder and making the PHP loades the XML depending on the URL?</p>

<p>I suppose I have to change the .htaccess file to redirect to that folder, but how can I tell what XML I must load? And the user must see on the search bar the URL he used, for example ""http://webapp.com/activities""</p>

<p>Can anybody help me please?
Thanks for all</p>

<p>I have tried setting the SelectedItemChanged e.Handled = true.  That didn't work.  I've tried handling the LostFocus of the TextBox and setting e.Handled = true and that hasn't worked.  This only seems to happen when I use the HierarchicalDateTemplate.  If I change the data to be one level only, this setup works fine.  </p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

Im looking to see if I can find some other algorithms which also color greyscale images, whether it be more or less accurate it doesnt matter, its just something im looking into to compare the methods and their accuracy.
I decided to use a similar method, just by using <code>getRed()</code> for image 1, 2 and 3 (as opposed to just 1) and dividing by 3 for each colour, in theory achieving the average red, green and blue values across the 3 images and creating a new image from it.</p>

<p>The resulting image is quite strange; the colors arent uniform i.e. random colours for each pixel, you can barely make out any characteristics of the image as its so grainy, I suppose is the best way to describe it. It looks like a normal photograph but with colour noise everywhere. Just wondering if anyone knew why this is happening? It wasnt my intentions and was expecting much more normal, quite similar to the original method but maybe more subdued/brighter colors for each.</p>

<p>Anyone know why this is happening? It doesnt seem right. Are there any other methods I could use to colour the images apart from the standard <code>getRGB()</code> ways?</p>

<pre><code>BufferedImage combinedImage = new BufferedImage(image1.getWidth(), image1.getHeight(), image1.getType());
        for(int x = 0; x &lt; combinedImage.getWidth(); x++)
            for(int y = 0; y &lt; combinedImage.getHeight(); y++)
                combinedImage.setRGB(x, y, new Color(
                new Color((image1.getRGB(x, y) + image2.getRGB(x, y) + image3.getRGB(x, y))/3).getRed(), 
                new Color((image1.getRGB(x, y) + image2.getRGB(x, y) + image3.getRGB(x, y))/3).getGreen(), 
                new Color((image1.getRGB(x, y) + image2.getRGB(x, y) + image3.getRGB(x, y))/3).getBlue()).
                getRGB());

<li>I verified the same behavior using HttpClient (GET on the service URL) and actually calling the web service via a CXF proxy</li>

<li>SSL debug is on ( javax.net.debug=all )</li>
<li>SSL debug blurts out the contents of both keystore and truststore (i.e. looks like java ""knows about them"") - link#2</li>
<li>seems like there's some client-server communication going on, but then it crashes for some reason link#3</li>
<li>I successfully connected to the server using the client and CA certificates both in a browser (Chrome) and using openssl s_client</li>
<li>wireshark shows less client-server talk from java ( link#4 ) then for example from Chrome ( link#5 )</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Another strange thing is, that I seem to be getting the same behavior when I set the keystore and when I don't (the only difference is that when I do the keystore contents get printed in the console, but that's it).</strong></p>

<p>I tried googling the problem and I saw numerous similar posts here on stackoverflow, but nothing helped.
I tried changing the protocol version (""TLSv1"", ""SSLv3"", even the weird v2 Hello).
Any help would be appreciated - maybe there's some fundamental thing I might have overlooked...I'm getting desperate here...

<p>Ideally it would also ignore <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;br&gt;</code></p>

<p>lets suppose I have a graph as below:</p>

<pre><code>root -[:DEFINES] -&gt; Shipment 1 
                -[:HAS_CONSIGNMENT]-&gt;Consignment 1
                            -[:HAS_ITEM]-&gt;Load Item 11
                            -[:HAS_ITEM]-&gt;Load Item 12
                            -[:HAS_CONSIGNEE]-&gt;Consignee 1
                -[:HAS_CONSIGNMENT]-&gt;Consignment 2
                            -[:HAS_ITEM]-&gt;Load Item 21
                            -[:HAS_ITEM]-&gt;Load Item 22
                            -[:HAS_CONSIGNEE]-&gt;Consignee 2
</code></pre>

<p>now suppose I want to get all the graph t o populate my Domain Model like below</p>

<pre><code>public class Shipment
{
    public List&lt;Consignment&gt; Consignments {get; set;}
}

 public class Consignment
 {
     public List&lt;LoadItem&gt; LoadItems {get; set;}
     public Consignee ShippedTo {get; set;}
 }

 public class LoadItem
 {
 }
</code></pre>

<p>i know that I can probably build a Cypher query like below 
How to retrieve connected graph using neo4jclient</p>

<pre><code>query = client.Cypher.Start(new { root = client.RootNode }).
            Match(""root-[:DEFINES]-&gt;load-[:HAS_CONSIGNMENT]-&gt;consignments -[:HAS_ITEM]-&gt;loadItem"").Match(""consignments-[:HAS_CONSIGNEE]-&gt;consignee"").
            Where((Load load) =&gt; load.Id == myId).
            Return(
            (load,consignments, loaditems)=&gt;
            new {
                loadInfo = load.As&lt;Node&lt;Load&gt;&gt;(),
                consignments = consignments.CollectAs&lt;Consignment&gt;(),
                loadItems = loaditems.CollectAs&lt;LoadItem&gt;()
            }); 
</code></pre>

<p>but I am not sure how this can be converted to represent the second level of list that gives me that Consignment 2 has Load Item 21 &amp; 22 where as Consignment 1 has Item 11 &amp; 12.</p>

<p>can some one please help me understand how this works as I primarily have been working in the EF and the graph query is really new to me.</p>

<p>Regards

void main() {
  mainActionEvent.forTarget(query('#segmented-buttons-list')).listen(eventHandler);

</code></pre>

<p>The ""MainActionEvent"" custom events are being dispatched by components instantiated within this ""list"" component.</p>

<p>As you can see from the above example I can catch the events if I create an EventStreamProvider in main.dart and target the component, that works fine (but by-passes the Stream getter in the component).</p>

<p>It would be great though if I could dispense with the EventStreamProvider in main.dart and simply bind to the onMainEvent getter on the component.</p>

<p>Is that possible?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2013-05-05:</strong>
Siggi explains below that at present it is not possible to do this, but there is a way to reference the component's CustomEventProvider's getter via the element's xtag.
I found that I had to use a Timer to query the DOM after main() has completed because xtags aren't populated until the main() event loop has finished.</p>

<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>void postMainSetup() {
  query('#segmented-buttons-list').xtag.onMainAction.listen(eventHandler);
}

void main() {
  Timer.run(postMainSetup);
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the above setup a new CustomEventProvider isn't needed to monitor the component.</p>

<p>Would it be fine choosing partitionKey: userId,
Rowkey: the date and time of the event</p>

<p>?</p>

<p>The user can not go on and off at the same time, so rowkey should be unique. I like about this that it keeps all data for a user on the same partition. Also does choosing the date as rowId make sorting more efficient? </p>

I'm trying to create a form to upload a file to a remote server, using php. I already tried in many ways, the only thing that works out of the box is cURL. 
In fact I need to specify explicitely </p>

<pre><code>-H 'Content-Type:multipart/form-data;boundary=----------------------------4ebf00fbcf09'
</code></pre>

<p>otherwise it won't work.</p>

<p>Well, this wouldn't be a problem except that I need to create a web page, for other users, and the hosting server does not include curl module for php.
Thus I created my simple html form</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""upload.php"" method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data""&gt;
Select file to upload:
&lt;input type=""file"" name=""fileToUpload"" id=""fileToUpload""&gt;
&lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Upload"" name=""submit""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>which works, and the following php file:</p>

<pre><code>$target_file = basename($_FILES[""fileToUpload""][""name""]);
$uploadOk = 1;
$fileType = pathinfo($target_file,PATHINFO_EXTENSION);

if(isset($_POST[""submit""]))
{
$check = true;
if($check !== false)
{
    echo ""File is correctly received&lt;br&gt;"";
    $uploadOk = 1;
}
else
{
    echo ""File is not received&lt;br&gt;"";
    $uploadOk = 0;
}
}
if ($_FILES[""fileToUpload""][""size""] &gt; 1000000) {
echo ""Sorry, your file is too large.&lt;br&gt;"";
$uploadOk = 0;
}
if($fileType != ""csv"" &amp;&amp; $fileType != ""txt"" ) 
{
echo ""Sorry, only .csv and .txt files are allowed.&lt;br&gt;"";
$uploadOk = 0;
}
if ($uploadOk == 0)
{
echo ""Sorry, your file was not uploaded.&lt;br&gt;"";
}
else
{

echo ""The name of the uploaded file is: "".$target_file;
echo ""&lt;br&gt;Displaying the content: &lt;br&gt;"";
$fp = fopen($_FILES[""fileToUpload""][""tmp_name""], 'rb');
while ( ($line = fgets($fp)) !== false) {
    echo $line;
    echo ""&lt;/br&gt;"";
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>UNTIL THIS POINT EVERYTHING WORKS :)</p>

    //Check to see if user has product in cart

    $check_in_cart = false;

    foreach ( $woocommerce-&gt;cart-&gt;get_cart() as $cart_item_key =&gt; $values ) {
        $_product = $values['data'];

        if ( $_product-&gt;id === $product_id ) {

    // Product id 1769 is in cart so show custom fields

    // Display custom fields for 1769...
    woocommerce_form_field( 'golf_field_one', array(

    'class'         =&gt; array('my-field-class form-row-wide'),
    'label'         =&gt; __('Golfer #1'),

    'placeholder'       =&gt; __('Name'),
    ), $checkout-&gt;get_value( 'golf_field_two' ));
    //etc...
    }
$check_in_cart = conditional_product_in_cart(1770); 

    // Product id 1770 is in cart so show custom fields
    if ($check_in_cart === true ) {
    // Display custom fields for 1770...
    woocommerce_form_field( 'dinner_field_one', array(

    'label'         =&gt; __('Dinner Name #2'),
    'placeholder'       =&gt; __('Name'),
    ), $checkout-&gt;get_value( 'dinner_field_two' ));
    //etc...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above code will conditionally display all of the woocommerce_form_field() that I have set under each product only if that product is in the customer's cart.</p>

<p>Now, what I need to do is show a certain number of the woocommerce_form_field() based on how many of each product #1769 or #1770 are in the cart. </p>

<p>So if there are two (2) of product #1769, there should be two fields shown. If there are two (2) of product #1769 and one (1) of product #1770, then there should be three total fields shown (two for product #1769 and one for product #1770).</p>

<p>At most, there will only be four of each product added in any given customer's cart, so it isn't a big deal to wrap each form field in an if() that checks something like:</p>

<pre><code>if([quantity of product 1769] &gt;= 1) {
    show first woocommerce_form_field()
}
if([quantity of product 1769 &gt;= 2) {
    show second woocommerce_form_field()
} //etc... 
// Repeat for product 1770...
</code></pre>

<p>I tried adding <code>$qty_in_cart = $values['quantity'];</code> to the <code>foreach()</code> in the first <code>function conditional_product_in_cart</code>, but that doesn't seem to want to give me anything. When I check <code>if (isset($qty_in_cart))</code>, it isn't set.</p>

<p>I feel like I'm close, but just can't figure out what I'm missing. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I am making a jni call to init the framework, then creating a global reference from that because that's the best way that I can think of for the moment.</p>

<p>Most of my JNI functions use the instance variables except for one to read files.
This is how I am setting up the globalref.</p>

<pre><code>JNIEXPORT void JNICALL SDL_Android_Init(JNIEnv* mEnv, jobject instance)
{
    Android_JNI_SetupThread();
    mInstance = instance;

    jclass clazz = (*mEnv)-&gt;GetObjectClass(mEnv, instance);
    mActivityClass = (jclass)((*mEnv)-&gt;NewGlobalRef(mEnv, clazz));
.....
}
</code></pre>

<p>I only use this mActivityClass global reference twice in this code to read do some functions that can be called at anytime.</p>

<p>The main question, specifically for android JNI. If I hold on to that globalref, since android controls it's application's lifecycle that ref will cause my app to ""resume"" even though i am attempting to quit.</p>

<p>If I try to clear that globalref with something like <code>DeleteLocalRef</code>, the app still seems to want to resume instead of quitting. Is there a way to stop this behavior?</p>

<p>Another question, is it possible to create a non static JNI function that get's called from the c side of the code world, so that I can get an instance jobject and use that to get a hold of the class instance?</p>

<p>For example typically you write a function in java:</p>

<pre><code>public native void do_c_work();
</code></pre>

<p>on the c side:</p>

<pre><code>void Java_com_test_java_do_c_work(JNIEnv* env, jobject inst)
{
  ...use the instance do your work
} 
</code></pre>

<p>What if some functions get called on the c side, that I would like to get an instance from java to do something with.</p>

<p>c function:</p>

<pre><code>public int get_number();
</code></pre>

<p>I am a little stuck here, I don't want to instantiate a new java object at this point, mainly because <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22326302/call-android-activity-from-jni-directly-from-c-process-without-java-side"">i saw this</a> and it seems like overkill. </p>

<p>There must be a way to overcome this obstacle, either by being able to call into java from c without using static or creating a new activity, there's one already there or freeing the globalref but that doesn't seem to be working out so well for me at this moment.</p>

<p>I have a list of MyError objects.
A MyError object has a errorcode (an enum) and an arraylist of MyEntryError objects. Some MyError may have the same errorcode.</p>

<p>I would like to create a LINQ query that take as input my list of MyError and outputs a new list of MyError so that, for each errorcode, there is only one MyError that will contain all the MyEntryError that failed with the errorcode of the MyError.</p>

<p>What I mean is let's say I have a list of MyError objects such as this one :</p>

<ul>
<li>MyError1 : errorcode = ErrorType1 Arraylist : A, C</li>
<li>MyError2 : errorcode = ErrorType2 ArrayList : B, D, E</li>
<li>MyError3 : errorcode = ErrorType2 ArrayList : F</li>
<li>MyError4 : errorcode = ErrorType1 ArrayList : G</li>
<li>MyError5 : errorcode = ErrorType3 ArrayList : Z</li>
</ul>

<p>My desired output is a list of MyError objects with the following objects :</p>

<ul>
<li>MyError1 : errorcode = ErrorType1 ArrayList : A, C, G</li>
<li>MyError2 : errorcode = ErrorType2 ArrayList : B, D, E, F</li>
<li>MyError3 : errorcode = ErrorType3 ArrayList : Z</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it possible with LINQ ? If so, How ? </p>

<p>I'm guessing that using an ArrayList instead of a List in the MyError class may be a problem so if it can't be done with an ArrayList, i would like to see a query that would works with a modified MyError class that uses a List</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>a) I created the .sqlite file using data loader app which uses UIManagedDcoument to add data to Core Data. The .sqlite file gets generated in documents directory. </p>

<p>b) I add the *.sqlite file to resources folder and add it to bundle. If I check the app bundle using Terminal..I see 'persistent store' and <code>&lt;app name.momd&gt;</code> file under the bundle directory.  There is no file with extension .sqlite</p>

<p>c)But in my code above when I check for whether files exists in app bundle  using line of code, it is successful. So file exists in bundle</p>

<pre><code>   NSString *file = [[[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath] stringByAppendingPathComponent:fileName];
</code></pre>

<p>d) But when try to copy, it fails and gives me (Cocca Error 206) meaning its unable to find the .sqlite file in the app bundle.</p>

<pre><code>  if([[NSFileManager defaultManager] copyItemAtPath:file toPath:copyToPath error:&amp;error])
</code></pre>

<p>which is in line with the fact that I don't see .sqlite file under app bundle directory instead I see a persistent store and .momd files.</p>

<p>So where I am going wrong ?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>This is an explanation of how I am generating my mydata.sqlite file. </p>

<p>I am using Core Data and want to provide a pre-poulated database upon first launch of app to the user. So I used a data loader app to create .sqlite file for me. I am using UIManagedDocument for core data. After I run the app, I see a mydata.sqlite directory gets created under documents directory. The directory structure is as follows</p>

<p>/users//.../documents/mydata.sqlite/storeContent/persistenStore.</p>

<p>So basically instead of creating a file, it creates a directory with .sqlite extension and I see persistentStore file. So when I try to copy resources under app bundle in target under build phases..it adds the persistentStore and not .sqlite file.</p>

<p>My question whatever is described is correct and I am supposed to handle it differently in my code. If yes, what is that I am supposed to do to get handle on data store. </p>

<p>I thought .sqlite was a file and not a directory. Please guide</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The current UI shows the list of possibilities, but nothing visually conveys the magnitude. Secondly, it would be great if the outcomes which share commonality (i.e., contain same genes) could be visually related.</p>

<p>My idea is something like a diamond shaped graph, or layered network, where at the top is the outcome where all genes are chosen, and below that a row of nodes with N-1, and so forth until the bottom row has 0 selected.  Edges would connect the nodes beween layers with shared genes. Size of nodes could indicate probability. Something like this (but ignore the data):</p>

What I'm trying to do is have tabs on my page, with each tab containing different dynamic content updated by user posts. 
So for example if Tab 1 is clicked I want it to show the posts associated with Tab 1, the same for Tab 2 and so on. I am not at all sure how best to achieve this. 
I was thinking an onlcick event which send the Tab id to the relevant php file and then returns the results from that file based on the id. Please point me in the direction of a better approach as I'm sure this isn't the best way.
Please see code below: 
index:<br>
    
    
    
    </p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

var id = 1;
var DATA = '&amp;id=' +id;
$.ajax({
type: ""POST"",
url: ""show.php"",
data: DATA,
cache: false,
success: function(data){

$("".test"").load(""show.php"");

}

}); 
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>The reason I am interested in this is because I have a worker thread that has a queue of Objects. </p>

<p>The thread loops continuously checking if it has any Objects in the queue that it needs to work with. If it loops and there is nothing in said queue the thread calls wait on on a separate Object. </p>

<p>When another thread adds an Object to the queue it calls notify on the Object that the worker thread would be waiting on regardless if the working thread is actually waiting. </p>

<p>Before anyone says anything, it is all synchronized correctly and won't throw any exceptions/errors. </p>

<p>My question is: is this setup slower then just having the worker thread just continue checking and never call <code>wait()</code> and what is the cost of calling <code>notify()</code> without any threads waiting on the Object? </p>

If a video has 5 tags, they all get stored in the tags table. I realized lately this is a bad table design because I have many duplicate tags. I created another table <strong>tag_map</strong>. It has three columns <code>id</code>, <code>vid_id</code>, <code>tag_id</code>. I want to basically implement the 'toxi' solution shown here <a href=""http://www.pui.ch/phred/archives/2005/04/tags-database-schemas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pui.ch/phred/archives/2005/04/tags-database-schemas.html</a>.</p>

<p>What I want to do is somehow transfer the data over from <strong>tags</strong> to <strong>tag_map</strong>, delete the vid_id column in <strong>tags</strong> and delete any extra entries in tags so each tag_map entry is mapped to only one tag entry. Anyone know an efficient way to do this? I keep thinking:</p>

<pre><code>$sql = 'SELECT * FROM tags';
$stmt3 = $conn-&gt;prepare($sql);
$result=$stmt3-&gt;execute();
while ($row = $stmt3-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {

$insert = $conn-&gt;prepare($sql);
$result=$insert-&gt;execute(array($id,$row['vid_id'],$row['id']));
}

</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>But, the overwriting fails since the original binary is still in execution and hence busy on disk, can somebody provide me some suggestions here to overcome this problem.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Now I would like to return this list, but with categories as <code>CategoryManager</code>, hence <code>List&lt;CategoryManager&gt;</code>. The reason I'm doing this is that the ""public interface"" of <code>Category</code> is extremly ugly, and I'd like to narrow it down by showing the outside user only the clean <code>CategoryManager</code>.</p>

<p>How do I do this?</p>

<p>I've come up with the following method:</p>

<pre><code>public &lt;T extends CategoryManager&gt; List&lt;T&gt; getAllCategories() {

<pre><code>struct _GNetSnmpVarBind {
  guint32       *oid;       /* name of the variable */
  gsize     oid_len;    /* length of the name */
  GNetSnmpVarBindType   type;       /* variable type / exception */
  union {

    gint64   i64;           /* 64 bit signed   */
    guint64  ui64;          /* 64 bit unsigned */
    guint8  *ui8v;          /*  8 bit unsigned vector */
    guint32 *ui32v;         /* 32 bit unsigned vector */
  }         value;      /* value of the variable */
  gsize     value_len;  /* length of a vector in bytes */
};
</code></pre>

<p>I could write a C wrapper function for each union element but for didactic purposes I'd rather work in Go. Here's how I'm trying to access the <strong>ui32v</strong> field:</p>

<pre><code>func union_to_guint32_ptr(cbytes [8]byte) (result *_Ctype_guint32) {
  buf := bytes.NewBuffer(cbytes[:])
  var ptr uint64
  if err := binary.Read(buf, binary.LittleEndian, &amp;ptr); err == nil {
    return (*_Ctype_guint32)(unsafe.Pointer(ptr))
  }
  return nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>However this gives an error <strong>cannot convert ptr (type uint64) to type unsafe.Pointer</strong></p>

<p>So how <em>do</em> I convert a <strong>uint64</strong> to a Go type that points to a C guint32? I've tried various combinations of casting to a uintptr then casting to a *_Ctype_guint32, casting to a uintptr then using unsafe.Pointer, ...</p>

<p>My reasoning is: I'm passed an array of 8 bytes. Convert that to a uint64, that's the memory address. Cast that to a pointer to a guint32 (ie a C array of guint32's), and return that as a result - that is the union field ""value"" as a guint32 *.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>Later I'll want to convert the C array of guint32's to a string utilising the value_len field, using a function I know already works:</p>

<pre><code>guint32_star := union_to_guint32_ptr(data.value)
result += OidArrayToString(guint32_star, data.value_len)

I have just gone through Nerd Dinner and actually created a complete website that sort of mimics Nerd Dinner.  But as great a job that Scott Guthrie did on it, there are big gaps that aren't answered such as, how do I throw a textbox on the listing page with a button and do a simple search.  In asp.net, I would throw a textbox, button and grid on the page and bind it to a sproc and away I go.  What is the equivalent in MVC.  I guess I need a really good tutorial on how to use MVC without using Linq-to-Sql.</p>

<p>I know I am sort of babbling on about this but it is a very serious question that still seems to go unanswered.  </p>

So given some total weight X, I'd like the sum of the weights of the cached items across all my caches to not exceed X.  I don't know how many caches will be needed up front, nor do the caches need to be 'fair' -- if one is heavily used while others are not, it should be able to take the lion's share of the global maximum.  I don't want misses on a cache because its considered full while other caches are mostly un-used and that space could be allocated by the heavily used cache.  These will be keeping me from going back to disk to get data, so low miss rates are important.</p>

<p>I thought about having a Weigher implementation that used a static variable that kept the total cached weight.  Then a Weigher would return the weight of the object, if that weight is less than the total remaining space, I'd return the weight as-is.  If it's more than the total weight left, I could return Long.MAX_VALUE so the item is not cached.  Each cache would have a high maximum weight, probably Long.MAX_VALUE-1 so that an element can always be inserted as long as we can calculate/allocate a weight for it.</p>

<p>The problem is that I don't see any way to know the total weight of cached objects.  I could decrement the total weight w/ eviction listeners, but there's no way that I can see to be notified when something gets inserted into the cache, nor do the cache stats reflect this in their data.</p>

<p>Is there any workaround for this or approach I could take to achieve this functionality?  I have a custom cache implementation that handles global weights, but lacks many of the features provided by the Guava cache, so I'd like to avoid re-implementing stuff if possible.  Though I don't mind trying to wire this into the Guava Cache if you can point me in a general direction. </p>

Now what I do differently is split the amount of work in large blocks that are then calculated in parallel on 2 mapping threads (since my CPU has 2 cores). Their results are written to a queue that is frequently accessed by a reducing thread.</p>

<p>The <strong>problem</strong>: I also implemented a non-parallel version of the calculation which is actually <strong>double</strong> as quick as the multithreaded one! But since they both calculate the same result the work in the parallel version must actually be shared between the mapping threads.</p>

<p>The calculation code is equal in both versions:</p>

<p>My last idea was using a <code>Thread</code> for the algorithm so both orientation and algorithm will be simultaneously. only using <code>ServerTransfer</code> made all the difference between orientation that can use as variables and can't.
This <code>ServerTransfer</code> somehow do not interrupt the orientation sensors from being read and most important being used</p>

<p>If you think that's the solution please help me understand how to <code>Thread</code> this algorithm. If not please share your ideas.</p>

<p>For example, for a simple 3 pixel texture, with 4 float components each, a plain JS array would first be declared:</p>

<pre><code>var pixels = [1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 1.04, 2.01, 2.02, 2.03, 2.04, 3.01, 3.02, 3.03];
</code></pre>

<p>Then to convert the plain JS array to a strongly typed array of floats which can be fed to the GPU, we simply use the Float32Array constructor which can take a plain JS array of numbers as input:</p>

<pre><code>pixels = new Float32Array(pixels);
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have our texture represented as a strongly typed array of floats, we can feed it to the GPU using an already established WebGL context (which is working and beyond the scope of this question), using texImage2D:</p>

<pre><code>gl.texImage2D(gl.TEXTURE_2D, 0, gl.RGBA, 3, 1, 0, gl.RGBA, gl.FLOAT, pixels);
</code></pre>

<p>Making the appropriate render calls shows that these floats are being passed into, and back out of (by encoding an output float into the fragment color) the GPU without error (albeit a slight loss of precision due to conversions).</p>

<p><b>The Problem</b></p>

<p>Converting from a plain JS array to a Float32Array is actually a pretty expensive operation, and it's far quicker to manipulate already converted floats in the Float32Array - an operation that seems to be supported according to most JS specs floating around: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Float32Array"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Float32Array</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once established, you can reference elements in the array using the object's methods, or using standard array index syntax (that is, using bracket notation).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem occurs when:</p>

<p>a Float32Array is created with a plain JS array of preset values</p>

<p>we change one or many values in the Float32Array using [] notation, ie:</p>

<pre><code>pixels[0] = 420.4;
pixels[1] = 420.4;
</code></pre>

<p>we pass the Float32Array to the GPU using texImage2D, and using the same method mentioned above shows that the inititally set values to the Float32Array somehow made it to the GPU without the two values changed to 420.4</p>

<p><b>WTF?</b></p>

<p>My best guess is that because strongly typed arrays are (usually) internally represented as a buffer and a view, that I'm updating the view, and the buffer is not reflecting the changes.  Logging the Float32Array to the browser console shows that the two changed numbers in this case appear to indeed be changed.  However because the contents of an ArrayBuffer can't be read through the console in Chrome, it's a debugging dead end as far as my skillset goes.</p>

<p>Trying the same create, convert, update and check methodology (without the GPU involved) using a NodeJS REPL, reveals that the buffer values are updated during the evaluation of <code>pixels[0] = 420.4;</code> and are not updated in a 'lazy' fashion when the buffer is read.</p>

<p>It may be possible that Chrome is lazy updating underlying buffers, but copying that data to the GPU does not trigger the getter but rather copies it raw from memory.</p>

<p><b>Temporary Solution</b></p>

<p>Until the underlying problem is found and remedied (if even applicable), it would seem that Float32Arrays are essentially immutable (cannot be changed) once created in the context of WebGL textures.  There also appears to be a <code>.set()</code> method attached to typed arrays, but this:</p>

<pre><code> pixels.set(new Float32Array([420.4]), index);
</code></pre>

<p>Seems like a lot of external boxing/conversion to get around a lazy buffer, especially one that claims to allow [] access.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The file which is being written gets to to size of 33 Bytes not more (header data only??).
On the Internet there is some explanation of pointer ownership in cv::Mat and I thought it would be released after the last reference to it is release which should not be the case since ""out"" is a reference. Btw. another way to convert an SVG into a cv::Mat is always welcome. As OpenCV seem to do not support SVGs this looked like a simple way to get it done.</p>

"21506547","1","","","2014-02-02 03:09:56","","1","99","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Pydev is a great eclipse plugin that let us write python code easily.</p>

<p>It can even give autocompletion suggestion when I do this:</p>

<pre><code>from package.module import Random_Class
x = Random_Class()
x.    # the autocompletion will be popped up, 
      # showing every method &amp; attribute inside Random_Class
</code></pre>

<p>That is great !!!</p>

<p><strong>The Problem (And My Question)</strong></p>

<p>However, when I don't use explicit import, and use  <code>__import__</code> for example, I can't have the same autocompletion effect.</p>

<pre><code>import_location = ""."".join(('package', 'module'))
__import__(import_location, globals(), locals(), ['*'])
My_Class = getattr(sys.modules[import_location], 'Random_Class')
x = My_Class()
x.    # I expect autocompletion, but nothing happened
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question:</strong> is there any way (in pydev or any IDE) to make the second one also
  show autocompletion?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Why do I need to do this?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I make a simple MVC framework, and I want to provide something like <code>load_model</code>, <code>load_controller</code>, and <code>load_view</code> which is still work with autocompletion (or at least possible to work)</p>

<p>So, instead of leave users do this (although I don't forbid them to do so):</p>

<pre><code>from applications.the_application.models.the_model import The_Model
x = The_Model()
x.    # autocompletion works
</code></pre>

<p>I want to let users do this:</p>

<pre><code>x = load_model('the_application', 'the_model')()
x.    # autocompletion still works
</code></pre>

<p>The ""applications"" part is actually configurable by another script, and I don't want users to change all of their importing model/controller part everytime they change the configuration. Plus, I think <code>load_model</code>, <code>load_controller</code>, and <code>load_view</code> make MVC pattern shown more obvious.</p>

<p><strong>Unexpected Answer</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I know some tricks such as doing this (as what people do with
web2py):</p>

<pre><code>import_location = ""."".join(('package', 'module'))
__import__(import_location, globals(), locals(), ['*'])
My_Class = getattr(sys.modules[import_location], 'Random_Class')
x = My_Class()
if 0:
    from package.module import Random_Class
    x = Random_Class()
x.    # Now autocompletion is going to work
</code></pre>

<p>and I don't expect to do this, since it will only add unnecessary
extra work.</p></li>
<li>I don't expect any <strong><em>don't try to be clever</em></strong> comments. I have enough of them</li>
<li>I don't expect <strong><em>dynamic import is evil</em></strong> comments. I'm not a purist.</li>
<li>I don't expect any <strong><em>just use django, or pylons, or whatever</em></strong> comments. Such as comments even unrelated to my question.</li>

<p>As per the following code, if i am executing it in <strong>simulator before signing</strong> working good &amp; website is loading. But <strong>after signing my app with signing keys</strong> and if i am executing in device, it is not executing means website is not loading, just blank page is displaying. </p>

<p><strong>Not getting what is the problem with my app before &amp; after signing.</strong> 
After searching in internet, got some information that we need to pass some suffixes to work after signing, in devices when using HTTPconnections like </p>

<pre><code>    HttpConnection httpConn;
    StreamConnection s;
    String url;
    s = (StreamConnection)Connector.open(url+"";deviceside=true"");   
</code></pre>

<p>But if i am passing the same code in browser field means it is concatenating with the given url like..</p>

<pre><code>   browserField.requestContent(""http://www.google.com"" + "";deviceside=true"");

This is my first time trying to use expect and it's, well, not what I expected. </p>

<p>Sample code below:</p>

<pre><code> /usr/bin/expect &lt;&lt;EOD
          set timeout 20
          set number [lindex $argv 0]
          set path [lindex $argv 1]

 spawn php -q go-pear.phar
 expect ""1-11, 'all' or Enter to continue:""
 send ""$number\r""
interact
 expect ""Installation base ($prefix) [/usr/local] :""
send ""$path\r""
 interact
EOD
</code></pre>

<p>This is not quite working at the moment as it's trying to fill in the /usr/local portion in the first menu as follows:</p>

<pre><code>1-11, 'all' or Enter to continue: invalid command name ""/usr/local""
    while executing
""/usr/local""
    invoked from within
""expect ""Installation base () [/usr/local] :""""
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone show me what I'm missing here? Also, I'd like to get this so I don't have to run it as ./script $var0 $var1 but rather just run it as ./script with everything being contained within and filled in, but not sure how to do that. </p>

<p>I wrote a service that monitors a folder in a network share (<code>\\\\machinename\abc\</code>) and each time a new file is added, it does something with that file.</p>

<p>The code itself works fine when I run it from a test harness, but when I run it as a service I get a <code>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</code> the moment a new file is added to the network folder, and the service crashes.</p>

<p>The service is running as a User, with my username and password, so I don't know what's going on, especially given that I don't have this problem when I run the code from a test harness from within VS.</p>

<p><em><strong></em>**EDIT*<em>*</em></strong>
Just wanted to add that I solved the problem. The key is to make sure that the file is readable before attempting to process the file (ie: write a try-catch statement inside a loop and attempt to obtain a FileStream object for the file). Also it's worth noting that for some strange reason this was not an issue when I ran the service from the test harness. Anyway, I'm glad the problem is solved!</p>

<p>Using Spring.NET + WPF.</p>

<p>Load two WPF buttons in the config:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;object name=""Button1"" type=""System.Windows.Controls.Button, PresentationFramework"" &gt;
  &lt;property name=""Name"" value=""Next"" /&gt;
  &lt;property name=""Width"" value=""200""/&gt;
  &lt;property name=""Content"" value=""Next""/&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;object name=""Button2"" type=""System.Windows.Controls.Button, PresentationFramework"" &gt;
  &lt;property name=""Name"" value=""Back"" /&gt;
  &lt;property name=""Width"" value=""200""/&gt;
  &lt;property name=""Content"" value=""Back""/&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and pass them into the constructor of a xaml class (""code behind"")</p>

<pre><code>&lt;object name=""MyNewScreen"" type=""MyControls.MyUserControl&gt;
  &lt;constructor-arg name=""buttons""&gt;
 &lt;list&gt;
    &lt;ref object=""Button1""/&gt;
    &lt;ref object=""Button2""/&gt; 
 &lt;/list&gt;
 &lt;/object&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>where the class constructor has:</p>

<pre><code>public DataGridControl(ArrayList buttons)
{
    //(yes this should be a List&lt;Button&gt; but I can't make spring happy with that)
    foreach(var b in buttons) this.stackPanel.Children.Add(b);
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Throws a:</p>

<p><code>Specified Visual is already a child of another Visual or the root of a CompositionTarget.</code></p>

<p>Now, I see the .GetHashCode() is the same for both buttons coming from Spring. So I can understand what WPF doesn't like. </p>

<p>But I can't do a <code>XamlReader.Load(new XmlNodeReader(document));</code> as <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=XamlReader.Load(new+XmlNodeReader(document))%3B"" rel=""nofollow"">some have suggested</a>, without losing my event wiring.</p>

<p>Any ideas how to get around this?</p>

<p>[Edit] 
I am wiring up events. Event wiring is not a problem, but it does explain why I'd want to do this in the first place. I'd left this out of the original post for the sake of brevity:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;object id=""eventListener2"" type=""MyEventListener""&gt;
&lt;listener event=""Click"" method=""b_Click""&gt;
&lt;ref object=""Button2"" /&gt;

<p>So in <code>testApp.cpp</code> <code>main()</code> function, I use the following:</p>

In other words, if I add log in <code>testMiscfunction()</code> in misc.dll, I would like that log from
<code>testMiscfunction()</code> to be written to mylogfile.log.
And of course, same things with common.dll.</p>

<p>Now here is sample of DLL Entry for misc.dll </p>

<p>I ask because I have implemented a BSP loader for a project that I'm working on. I can take the vertices and indexes to render the BSP perfectly, so that's not an issue. However, the engine that I am working with only supports collision detection with actual <code>Model</code>s. I figured there may be some way to do this so that I can store each face as a separate model and still be able to keep the culling and occlusion functionality of the BSP, and to be honest I have no idea how to write a Content Pipeline Processor to automatically do this.</p>

<p>So, is there anyway to load that data into a <code>Model</code> without using some form of <code>LoadContent</code>, or would I be better off trying to learn how to write a BSP Pipeline processor?</p>

<p>A similar view works fine for the Create operation, but I can't seem to set the existing selection in each of the dropdown lists.  You can see I'm explicitly setting the datetime for each game.</p>

<p>The <code>new { value = Model.Games[i].HomeTeamId }</code> line sets an attribute on the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> html element, but obviously this isn't going to work.  I thought about setting another attribute and using jQuery to set the selected item, but it feels even more hacky than the existing code.</p>

<p>I'm fairly new to MVC, so I can definitely appreciate if I'm doing this all the wrong way.  Can anyone assist?</p>

<p>I've been experimenting with several modes of AES (particularly CBC and GCM) and there are some pros and cons I've found on each approach.</p>

<p>After researching and asking around, I come to the conclusion that at least at this moment, using AES+GCM is not feasible for me, mostly because of the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25992131/slow-aes-gcm-encryption-and-decryption-with-java-8u20"">issues</a> it <a href=""http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/security-dev/2014-March/010238.html"" rel=""nofollow"">has in Java</a> and the fact that I <em>can't use BouncyCastle</em>.</p>

<p>So I am writing this to talk about the protocol I'm going to be implementing to complete the task. Please provide feedback as you see fit.</p>

<h1>Encryption</h1>

<ul>
<li>Using AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding with 256 bit keys</li>
<li>The file will be encrypted using a custom CipherOutputStream. This output stream will take care of writing a custom header at the beginning of the file which will consist of at least the following:
<ul>
<li>First few bytes to easyly tell that the file is encrypted</li>
<li>IV</li>
<li>Algorithm, mode and padding used</li>
<li>Size of the key</li>
<li>The length of the header itself</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While the file is being encrypted, it will be also digested to calculate its authentication tag.</li>
<li>When the encryption ends, the tag will be appended at the end of the file. The tag is of a know size, so this makes it easy to later recover it.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Decryption</h1>

<ul>
<li>A custom CipherInputStream will be used. This stream knows how to read the header.</li>
<li>It will then read the authentication tag, and will digest the whole file (without encrypting it) to validate it has not been tampered (I haven't actually measure how this will perform, however it's the only way I can think of to safely start decryption wihtout the risk of knowing too late the file should not have been decrypted in the first place).</li>
<li>If the validation of the tag is ok, then the header will provide all the information needed to initialize the cipher and make the input stream decrypt the file. Otherwise it will fail.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this something that seems ok to you in order to handle encryption/decryption of big files?</p>

This command works and runs a Java process from the terminal, but I cannot figure out how to get it to work with Runtime.getRuntime().exec from another process.</p>

Still, the process won't start when I make that terminal command into a string like so:</p>

<pre><code>Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(""java -Djava.library.path=/home/john/native_so_libraries/linux-64 -cp '/home/john/NetBeansProjects/SendReceive/dist/SendReceive.jar:/home/j‌​ohn/Desktop/Dropbox/Libjitsi_linux_64/*' Main \""send\"""");

Basically, I have a site set up in Appengine that needs to run some C code supplied by (a group of trusted) users and run it, and return the output of the code back to the user. I have two options from here: I either need to completely run the code in the browser, or find some way to have Python run this C code without any system calls.</p>

<p>I've seen mixed responses to my question. I've seen solutions like Emscripten, but that doesn't work because <strong>I need the LLVM code to be produced in the browser</strong> (I cannot run compilers in AppEngine.) I've tried various techniques, including scraping from the output page on codepad.org, but the output I will produce is so high that I cannot use services like codepad.org because they trim the output (my output will be ~20,000 lines of about 60 characters each, which is trimmed by codepad due to a timeout). My last resort is to make my own server that can serve my requests from my Appengine site, but that seems a little extreme.</p>

<p>The code supplied by my users will be very simple C. There are no I/O or system operations called by their code. Unfortunately, I probably cannot simply use a find/replace operation in their code to translate it to Javascript, because they may use structures like multidimensional arrays or maybe even classes.</p>

<p>I'm fine with limiting my users to one cross-platform browser, e.g. Chrome or Firefox. Can anyone help me find a solution to this question? I've been baffled for days.</p>

"7533094","1","","","2011-09-23 18:07:17","","0","79","<p>My question is mostly about OOP and ORM design. I'm creating models in Zend for Users and Groups, and using mappers for the db (and also using dependency injection). I have a relational table, <code>user_groups</code>, for linking. I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about getting and setting a user's groups, or a group's users. I am currently looking at 3 options, let me know if I'm forgetting something:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take care of joining db tables in mapper so user's groups look like part of the User model</li>
<li>Add a UserGroupsMapper: create functions like user->addToGroup($group)</li>
<li>Add a UserGroupsMapper <em>and</em> UserGroup model: create functions like userGroup->add($user, $group)</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Thoughts about option 1: </p>

<p>Is there supposed to be a one-to-one relationship between models and db tables, or can one model represent multiple tables? If so, when would it not be ok? Another example: If I have a <code>color</code> table and a <code>color_type</code> table (with things like ""warm"" or ""cool"" as rows), does Color contain the colorType as an attribute/instance variable? Or does it reference ColorType as an object by means of <code>color_type_id</code>, or does it have an actual ColorType object as an ivar? </p>

<hr>

<p>Thoughts about option 2: </p>

<p>For a function like user->addToGroup($group), would it call the UserMapper method, which then calls the method in the UserGroupsMapper, or would it call the method in the UserGroupsMapper directly? From my understanding, the mapper is supposed to abstract the model from the data, but what does that mean as far as relationships between models? Are the models supposed to know how they are linked, or just the mappers?</p>

<hr>

<p>Thoughts about option 3: </p>

<p>Adding a UserGroup model creates the possibility of accessing that model in a controller. Should the Group controller know the model relationships, like userGroup objects, or should it only be able to do things like tell a group to add a user?</p>

<hr>

<p>I hope the question is clear enough. I know it is pretty involved, but I haven't been able to find a good answer yet.</p>

<p>I don't really know much about these things, I'm pretty new to it, so thank you for any help in advance :).     </p>

I notice it crashes when they all get loaded on my iPhone 3G (128 mb ram), but not when I test it on a 3rd gen iPod (256 mb ram).  So I assume there must be some percentage that is allowed for each app to use?  My app has about 30 images at about 440k each loaded so 13.2mb.  I didn't think that would be too much.  They need to be swapped in and out pretty quickly, so releasing the ones not in use from memory doesn't seem like a good idea...</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The app swaps images based on the way the phone is being tilted.  It's 30 images from a 3D scene, so when you move it, it changes the perspective.  It needs to be as smooth as possible.</p>

I'm working on an iPhone app which is based on the ""Navigation-Based application"" app template. My RootViewController is, of course, an UITableView. From that TableView, I can navigate to some views and one TableView.<br>
I'm using a global toolbar, it's called in the RootViewController (like in <a href=""http://www.iphonesdkarticles.com/2008/09/navigation-controller-uitoolbar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">that tutorial</a>). Buttons are added to it in the view that needs the buttons. <br>
Now, I have some questions regarding the use of the toolbar ;-)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I insert a flexible space with that code:</p>

<p>UIBarButtonItem *flexibleSpace = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemFlexibleSpace target:self action:nil];</p></li>
</ol>

<p>and a fixed space like this:</p>

<pre><code> UIBarButtonItem *fixedSpace = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemFixedSpace target:self action:nil];

<p>My question: The flexible space is working, but how do I tell the fixed space which width it should have?

2. I noticed that my Todo-App ""Things"" uses a global toolbar with switching button sets. But in Things, there's some kind of fading effect when the button set is changing. How can I do that in my app?<br><br></p>

It's a bit difficult to explain so I've made a working example available here: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/CVPhW/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/CVPhW/2/</a>  I've stripped it out as much as I can but I left all the containing <code>div</code>s in there in case they were somehow relevant.</p>

<p>Try hovering your cursor over the very bottom of each button and you'll see the hover doesn't activate unless you move the cursor around 10 pixels upwards.  It works fine in FF, Chrome and believe it or not, even IE6.</p>

<p>It's something to do with the <code>bottom: 12px;</code> style applied to <code>#menucontainer ul li a</code>.  If I remove that, the whole portion activates properly, but it's not positioned correctly.  The text position in that example is how I'd like it to be, but with a fix for the hovering.</p>

<p>I am implementing Google in-app billing in my Android app and intend to offer ""subscriptions"" for the application users.  I installed and coded Google's In-App Billing version 3 (IAB V3) and got everything working using Google's test account.  Then I set up the product in the developer dashboard and changed the SKU in the code to point to my new subscription product.  Rolled it out only to get ""item not found"" messages when you try to purchase the subscription.  Searched the forums and saw lots of people saying ""just, wait a few hours and it'll start working"".  Well I waited overnight and it still errored with ""item not found"".  I then realized that IAB V3 does not support subscriptions - Doh!</p>

<p>I need to rewrite using IAB V2.  In the SDK manager, I only see ""Google Play Billing Library - 3"".  How do I install version 2 so I can get in-app billing subscriptions?  I have deleted Google Play Billing Library version 3 in the SDK manager and refreshed.  ""Obsolete"" is checked and it still does not offer version 2 for installation.</p>

Now, if the web.config file or the contents of the bin folder, etc are modified, the appdomain will be ""recycled"".
My question is, at the end of the recycling process, will the appdomain be loaded with assemblies and ready to serve the next request? or a page has to be requested to trigger the assemblies to load?.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>My experience:</strong> PHP (3 weeks). CSS3, HTML, Basic Javascript.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>My Problem:</strong> Getting AJAX to work. I want ajax to get my data from the php file which gets the votes from my test server (Xampp) database. So each time the user clicks on good or bad AJAX should display the new results without refreshing the page. The issue is however that: A) My if statements work by checking isset($_POST) which wont work anymore if I call by AJAX. B) Preventing refresh. C) Making AJAX update after every click. I know im nearly there, im just missing something and I dont know exactly what it is to be honest.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>What I tried:</strong> Checked my database connection. Checked if my php code worked without ajax and it does perfectly fine (I am just displaying half of the functionality here, a lite version, for the sake of simplicity). Tried to change submit to button. Cache clearing. Jquery is in the head of my document and the path is correct. Watched tutorials and read the documentation but I am just not heading anywhere, probably due to lack of experience.</p>

<p>Edit: Sessions and everything php works fine. I my session start and database connection are included on the very top.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> How do I fix this ajax so that it always updates my numbers?</p>

<p>My java program connects to a web form and logs in. I have the username and password form another part of the code.
The HTML form will contain different input types obviously. Depending on the user, and the site, each field will be named differently. Here's a sample web form:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;FORM METHOD=POST ACTION=""/my.form""&gt;
Username:
&lt;INPUT NAME=""username""&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Password
&lt;INPUT TYPE=""PASSWORD"" NAME=""password""&gt;

&lt;INPUT TYPE=""HIDDEN"" NAME=""my-hidden-name"" VALUE=""someValue""&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;&lt;INPUT TYPE=""SUBMIT"" VALUE=""Login""&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In this form, the <code>NAME</code> fields can be anything and will change form site to site. I've gotten around this by requiring a <code>PROPERTIES</code> file that stores the fields, eg:</p>

<pre><code>username
password
my-hidden-name=someValue
SUBMIT=Login
</code></pre>

<p>This works for half of the above fields. The problem is the <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> fields.</p>

<p>I already have the username and password, so I COULD just do: <code>if(currentField==""password"") string=mypass123</code>. but then what if someone makes a form where the username/password field is called <code>user1</code> or <code>passwordField</code>, or basically anything other than what I've put in the <code>if()</code>!!</p>

<p>So, can anyone suggest a way I can handle any combination of names, and still identify which ones are the username and password fields? Here's my current code:</p>

<pre><code>//Read file logic here
Properties formProps=getDataFromResource(pathToFormFieldsPropfile);

if(null!=formProps)
{
    //Gets a list of all the field names, eg ""username"", ""password"", ""submit""
    Enumeration&lt;?&gt; formFields=formProps.keys();
    while(formFields.hasMoreElements())
    {
        String tempString=(String) formFields.nextElement(); //This gets the field name
        query+=tempString   //Will contain field name
                +""=""        //Used as a divider in the querystring, ie field=value
                +formProps.get(tempString)  //Value corresponding to field
                //+ URLEncoder.encode((String) formProps.get(tempString),Charset.defaultCharset().toString())   //The value needs to be encoded for POST
                +""&amp;""; //The trailing one of these will have to be removed at the end
    }
}

<p>When I started around 3 instances of the batch, the time taken to set values in IMap goes beyond 50 seconds and slowly the following exception is thrown:</p>

        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>The s_map is used by all the threads to set/get entries from IMap. I set a eviction time of 12 hours when I set the entries into the IMap. I am using HazelCast 3.3 on both the server and the client. This issue is consistently reproducible when the number of concurrent threads are increased. When I shutdown the spring batch and start again, it works well. Could you please help me with this.</p>

<pre><code>class ScanProcess : QObject{
Q_OBJECT
public:
  QProgressDialog* progress;
private:
  ScanProcessThread* thread;
};

class ScanProcessThread : QThread {
Q_OBJECT
public:
  void run();
};
</code></pre>

<p>This is after running qt3to4 and making the appropriate changes from the QT Porting guide.</p>

<p>In the original design, inside the ScanProcessThread:</p>

<pre><code>void ScanProcessThread::run(){
//...
ProgressInfo *prog = new ProgressInfo(); //then fill it in
QCustomEvent* progEvent = new QCustomEvent(QEvent::User+1, (void*)prog);
QCoreApplication::postEvent(parent, progEvent);//Parent is pointer to the ScanProcess
//...
}

void ScanProcess::customEvent(QCustomEvent *e){
  if(e-&gt;type() == QEvent::User+1){
    //update QProgressDialog
    progres-&gt;setValue(prog.index);//Value from the ProgressInfo passed above
    //This line crashes deep in ntdll, but I have traced it to the QProgressDialog::repaint()
  }
}

struct ProgressInfo {int count; int index; QString text;};
</code></pre>

<p>So, that's the important code. The call to QProgressDialog::Repaint seems to always crash somewhere deep in ntdll. I have tried two other methods: 
1) Use QCoreApplication::postEvent()
2) Pass the QProgressDialog* and let ScanProcessThread update it directly. In every case, it's the QProgressDialog::repaint() that fails. Any ideas?</p>

<pre><code> Inner classes cannot have static declaration
</code></pre>

<p>Of course I do have a nested static class but this is how android/google defined it.</p>

<pre><code>  public class ItemsViewAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter&lt;ItemsViewAdapter.ViewHolder&gt; {
        ... 
        ...
       public static class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
           ...
       }
</code></pre>

<p>Why i am geting this error, I hear its better to use nested class as a static so you are not wasting a reference but current version of android studio is complaining</p>

<p>Any ideas ?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>My first thought is that it should, because enumerating <code>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</code> naturally blocks write operations. Which to me means that the implementation should already be fairly aligned with an <code>ISet&lt;T&gt;</code> implementation. Also, looking at the <code>ICollection&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;&gt;.Contains</code> implementation for <code>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</code> and <code>HashSet&lt;T&gt;</code> they seem to be functionally identical.</p>

<p>I did notice however that the Java <code>Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code> and c++ <code>std::map</code> also do not extend their counterpart set interfaces.</p>

<p>If correct then how would you go about a concrete implementation, considering performance and memory usage?</p>

<p>But I want to do it a little bit more efficiently. I want to have one table keeping all amendments for all tables. At the very most basic, its columns would be <code>table, column, value</code>.

<p>So far what I found is this thread <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7889099/updateprogress-not-working-when-called-thru-javascript"">UpdateProgress Not working when called thru javascript</a> but it does not help me (I do not know how to use it right in my case).</p>

<p>When I press any button in update panel, progress bar is showing, problem is just with this manually called __doPostBack from javascript. </p>

<p>How to fix it and make updateProgress works ?</p>

David Beasley has an excellent presentation on Python coroutines <a href=""http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/"" rel=""nofollow"">A Curious Course on Coroutines and Concurrency</a>.</p>

<p>As the PEP states, A yield expression's value is None whenever the generator is resumed by a normal next() call.  To instantiate the generator either next() or send(None) must be called (i.e. cannot send non-None value initially).</p>

<p>Is there any advantage in calling next() vs send(None)?  next() is a Built_in function, so perhaps that's a factor, but there doesn't seem to be any other differences.  I'm somewhat surprised, it would seem more Pythonic to add an optional variable to next than add a new function that does the same thing.  Am I missing something?</p>

<p>Here is a simple coroutine to keep a running total of numbers entered, by sending them to the coroutine.</p>

<p>Hi, I wrote a program that created all the permutations of a given string.  I'm trying to modify it to not use recursion while using a queue.  I am not sure how to do this... any help will be appreciated! Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>vector&lt;string&gt; generate_substrings(string s)
{
    vector&lt;string&gt; result;
    if(s.length()==0) result.push_back(s);
    else 
    {
        for(int j = 0; j &lt;= s.length(); j++)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; s.substr(0,j) &lt;&lt; "" "";
        }
        generate_substrings(s.substr(1,s.length()-1));
    }
    system(""Pause"");
    return result;
}

int main()
{
    vector&lt;string&gt; result;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Please enter a word: "";
    string word;
    cin &gt;&gt; word;
    generate_substrings(word);
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;

<p>ex. when i want to add multiple reciepients at ""To"" field, instead of doing as following,</p>

<pre><code>   mailitem.To = a + "";"" + b + "";"" + c;

<p>i do whats below, which is simpler, especially when i'm doing it in a loop.</p>

<pre><code>   mailitem.Recipients.add(""a"");
   mailitem.Recipients.add(""b"");
   mailitem.Recipients.add(""c"");

<p>My problem is, i also want to add multiple recipients at ""CC"" field and the function above only works for ""To"" field. How can i add multiple recipients to ""CC"" field without having to do string manipulation.</p>

<p>normally i would add recipients to cc like so,</p>

It renders the text (to be scrolled) to control's surface <em>only once</em>, using <code>TextRenderer.DrawText</code>.
It then starts a timer, which upon each of its ticks, Bit-Blits (<code>BitBlt</code>) the entire client-rectangle one pixel up. control's device-context is <strong>both the source and the destination of the <code>BitBlt</code> operation</strong>, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Protected Sub handleTimerTick(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    Dim oG As Graphics = Me.CreateGraphics()
    Dim sHdc As IntPtr = oG.GetHdc()

<p><strong>If I set a <em>picture</em> as control's background</strong>, <code>BitBlt</code> scrolls the background along with the text displayed over it. Ofcourse, I'd like only the text to be scrolled, and the background image to remain static.</p>

<p>I have found the following thread, which suggests using <code>TransparentBlt</code> instead of <code>BitBlt</code> where the background is a solid uniform color to be ignored : <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14058848/how-to-copy-with-bitblt/14059531#14059531"">How to copy with BitBlt?</a></p>

<p>The solution suggested there would not be suitable to the case on hand, in which a colorful background is used.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> that the <em>text</em> itself is of a solid uniform color.</p>

<p>The errors started occurring after I started using <code>&lt;SharePoint:CompositeField&gt;</code> in my form.  I may be wrong, but I'm attempting to use this control as I thought it would automatically adapt to the different field types of my various fields as well as adjusting to the page mode (new, edit, or display).  I suspect I'm using it incorrectly, but the MSDN documentation and any documentation I can find from surfing the web is rather sparse...</p>

<p>How should I use this control?  Or should I just break-down and manually deal with each individual field using basic asp.net controls?  Are there better options?  Amongst the couple dozen fields, a few need custom work - if not for them, the rest of the fields would be handled fine with SharePoint's default list item forms.</p>

What methods are available for me to easily protect the key? Key containers seem to be one option but I don't see how they protect the key and/or the method used to generate said key.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

I could force her to define classes with hook methods that can be called by the framework, but I'd like to keep it lean and take advantage of the new C++11 facilities whenever I can. So I'm thinking about accepting <code>std::function</code> objects, possibly instantiated from lambda expressions, as parameters, and call them when needed. The only think I'm wondering about is whether the compiler (in my case gcc, but I'd like to know about Xcode and Visual C++ as well) will be able to take the std::function objects and inline the function definitions, so that they are optimized together with the rest of the code.</p>

<p>PS: from the comments, it looks like the first revision of my question was obscure to most of the users, probably my fault for using an incorrect language. So I have reworded it, I hope someone can understand the concept I'm trying to convey here (and possibly suggest a solution). </p>

<p>PPS: someone suggested to use templates, that is an idea I have thought about, but I'd like to know if there's an alternative. I don't have anything against templates, but I plan to make a template-based version as soon as this one is working because I find it easier to reason in terms of dynamic objects.</p>

The string property works, but the bool doesn't. I get no errors, but changes aren't reflected either way.</p>

<p>I define the property like this:</p>

<pre><code>private static readonly DependencyProperty IncludeSubdirectoriesProperty =
    DependencyProperty.Register(
        ""IncludeSubdirectories"",
        typeof(bool),
        typeof(DirectorySelect),
        new FrameworkPropertyMetadata(false) { BindsTwoWayByDefault = true }
        );

public bool IncludeSubdirectories
{
    get { return (bool) GetValue(IncludeSubdirectoriesProperty); }
    set { SetValue(IncludeSubdirectoriesProperty, value); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the XAML for the user control i bind to the property like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;CheckBox
    Name=""IncludeSubdirectoriesCheckbox""
    IsChecked=""{Binding Path=IncludeSubdirectories, Mode=TwoWay, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}""&gt;
    Include subfolders&lt;/CheckBox&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And when i use the control i bind to the properties like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Controls:DirectorySelect
    Directory=""{Binding Directory}""
    IncludeSubdirectories=""{Binding WatchSubDirs}""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>""Directory"" is the string property that works just fine. I bind to them both in the same way, but i just can't make the bool work.</p>

<p>Where did i go wrong?</p>

<pre><code>var page = {
    add: function(k, v) {
        this[k] = v;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I recently tried doing it with the var page = function() { blah blah } page.prototype = { style but now when I am trying to send off stuff through ajax everything breaks. I put in console logs to try to see what is happening and it seems that in the ajax call, the objects are being turned into window scope, and then the functions are trying to be parameterized. Horrible explanation, I apologize, here is the code, maybe it will make more sense...</p>

<pre><code>var bioLocation = function(obj) {
    this.ID = 0,
    this.name = '',
    this.address = '';
    if(typeof obj != 'undefined') {
        return this.init(obj);
    }
}
bioLocation.prototype = {
    init: function(obj) {
        for(var index in obj) {
            this[index] = obj[index];
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously a stripped down version of my real object, but a perfect representation. So then later on in the code I have a button even that will send data off over ajax to save some stuff like so.</p>

<pre><code>$('.save').click(function() {
    var postData = {};
    var saveTest = new bioLocation({ID: $('.whatever').val()});
    postData.locations = saveTest;
    var reply;
    $.ajax({
        async: false,
        type: ""POST"",
        data: postData,
        dataType: 'json',
        success: function(msg) {
            reply = msg;
        }
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Again, obviously a very simplified version of my code, but pretty much right on target. 
The problem is I am getting very strange errors...
""cannot read property 'undefined' of undefined"" the line will point directly to the second line of the init function in the bioLocations prototype.</p>

<p>I have done tons of console logs throughout the code, when I put them in the init method it will log twice, once when I create the object in the click function, and once in the ajax call. Here is the code with the console logs in it...</p>

<pre><code>var bioLocation = function(obj) {
    this.ID = 0,
    this.name = '',
    this.address = '';
    if(typeof obj != 'undefined') {
        return this.init(obj);
    }
}
bioLocation.prototype = {
    init: function(obj) {
        console.log(this);
        for(var index in obj) {
            this[index] = obj[index];
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I will get 2 console logs when I click the submit button, the first shows...</p>

<p>bioLocation {ID: 5, name: '', address: ''}</p>

<p>then the second time it logs (still within the same click event) it will log...</p>

<p>Window {top: Window, window: Window, location: Location, external: Object...}</p>

<p>and then I will get that error ""Cannot read property 'undefined' of undefined""</p>

<p>I can't figure out why it is logging it twice, and more so, why is the second log a Window object. It seems like the ajax call is trying to serialize the functions and getting errors, but I have never seen a prototype being serialized when the object is passed into ajax as a param. I can confirm that it is in fact trying to param the functions because with more logging and hair pulling I was actually able to see the ajax call in the network tab and it did in fact have the init: undefined as one of the params being passed to the ajax page.</p>

<p>So I guess my questions are, how do you stop jquery's ajax function from parameterizing the prototype piece of an object when using it as a param? And, why on earth is it actually adding the prototype into the the call?</p>

<p>Please, you gotta help me, I am loosing my mind here. I have never seen anything like this. Thank you in advance.</p>

I would like to learn the correct way to reach my goals for this project, which at this point is simply completing the UI. </p>

<p>The CurrentStatusObject notifies changes internally and that does work. The problem is that the changes are only reflected in the User Interface if I set the DataContext for the UI to that one object. I want to be able to set the DataContext to include a wider scope. I would be happy if I could use the instance of MyClass as the DataContext, but that is not working right now.</p>

<p>The question is Why? and How do I get it to work (using correct practices)?</p>

<pre><code>Private Iterator Function ConvertList(x As MyObject, something) As IEnumerable(Of MyObject)

      If(item.Equals(x)) Then

<p>Now, what happens when I execute it on a List(Of MyObject) with 3 items:  It takes a first element, goes to the yield statement as intended. Then, instead of going to the 2nd element, it throws a KeyNotFoundException on the ""Next item"" statement (""The given key was not present in the dictionary"").</p>

<p>This puzzles me. I do use some Dictionaries, but the collection here is a List(Of T). Hence, I figure it must be some internal representation.  If I remember right, List(Of T) implements IEnumerable(Of T), so For Each should be possible right?  Nevertheless I tried to solve by using AsEnumerable(), as well as trying a normal For loop, rather than the ForEach.  Both didn't seem to help. Now, I am kind of out of ideas.</p>

<p>Can anyone give me clue?</p>

<p>Edit:
The calling code is quite simply: </p>

<pre><code>  Dim newList As List(Of MyObject) = ConvertList(...).ToList()

<p>Okay, so the exception now makes slightly more sense. I suppose it is indeed an internal representation, although I do not really get why that is used. It indeed fails on the movenext. Is there a way that I can debug and see what kind of key it is fetching? Or what this internal dictionary looks like?</p>

<p>What this code is supposed to do is increment through the linked list of memory locations where individual pieces of data of type T are being stored. My reasoning for this being a valid piece of code is that, because the initially allocated memory is divided into pieces the size of <code>sizeof(T)</code>. Therefor, I assumed that it would be appropriate to typecast the memory address to a pointer of type <code>T*</code> so that the individual block of memory would be completely deallocated. This would be done for the entire linked list, ensuring that all allocated memory is freed. However, when I run the code, it always throws the assert on the delete.</p>

<p>Stepping through the code showed that after the first iteration of typecasting and <code>delete</code>ing, the pointers take on strange values (the <code>next</code> variable, for instance:     </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>next  0x004b2864 {next=0xfeeefeee {next=??? } }   FreeList *</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whereas before, it was</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>next  0x006c2864 {next=0x006c2860 {next=0x006c285c {next=0x00000000
   } } }  FreeList *</p>
</blockquote>

<p>just as it should be). I have tried this approach many different times in many different ways, including typecasting to <code>void*</code> instead of <code>T*</code>.</p>

<p>This problem has had me stumped for days, and any help would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

The game consists of several order-independent 'levels' that each correlate to an entry in a database.  Metaphorically, you can think of it as similar to hangman in that the game is the same each time but the content in different (in the case of hangman, that is the word being guessed).  </p>

<p>When the user plays a level, I create a story via the OpenGraph API.  So say for example Bob plays level Alpha, and his friend Sue sees his feed story which says ""Bob played Alpha in SomeGame.""  I'd like a link in that story to take Sue directly to playing level ""Alpha"" in SomeGame, and <em>not</em> to the generic entry point in the game where the user can pick a level (i.e. what normally happens when you hit the Canvas URL).  It appears that you can use params, like this:</p>

<p>apps.facebook.com/somegame?level_id=1234,</p>

<p>and then in your Canvas URL endpoint you can redirect based on those params.  But is that the preferred way to handle this?</p>

<p>Also, if the story title in the Feed is ""Bob played Alpha in SomeGame"", I'd like the link on ""Alpha"" to take Sue to playing ""Alpha"", but as far as I can tell that link is generated by og:url in the object metadata, meaning it has to link to</p>

<p>www.somegame.com/level/:id, and not</p>

<p>apps.facebook.com/somegame?context_params=some_stuff.  </p>

<p>a javascript redirect, which uses parameters for the level id:</p>

<p>(top.location.href=""http://apps.facebook.com/somegame?level_id=1234)</p>

My problem is that I have to draw everything at a single point in time. I don't know if that actually makes sense, but it seems to me that it calls the <code>drawRect</code> method only once, at that ""once"" is on startup.</p>

<p>Here is my code so far:</p>

<p>Header file.</p>

<pre><code>NSBezierPath *thePath;
NSColor *theColor;
NSTimer *updateTimer;
NSPoint *mousePoint;
int x = 0;
int y = 0;

@interface test : NSView {
    IBOutlet NSView *myView;

}

@property (readwrite) NSPoint mousePoint;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Then, implementation in the .m file.</p>

<pre><code>@implementation test

@synthesize mousePoint;

- (void) mouseDown:(NSEvent*)someEvent {         
    CGEventRef ourEvent = CGEventCreate(NULL);
    mousePoint = CGEventGetLocation(ourEvent);
    NSLog(@""Location: x= %f, y = %f"", (float)mousePoint.x, (float)mousePoint.y);
    thePath = [NSBezierPath bezierPathWithRect:NSMakeRect(mousePoint.x, mousePoint.y, 10, 10)];
    theColor = [NSColor blackColor];  

} 

- (void) mouseDragged:(NSEvent *)someEvent {
    mousePoint = [someEvent locationInWindow];
    NSLog(@""Location: x= %f, y = %f"", (float)mousePoint.x, (float)mousePoint.y);
    x = mousePoint.x;
    y = mousePoint.y;
    [myView setNeedsDisplay:YES];

}

- (void) drawRect:(NSRect)rect; {
    NSLog(@""oisudfghio"");
    thePath = [NSBezierPath bezierPathWithRect:NSMakeRect(x, y, 10, 10)];
    theColor = [NSColor blackColor];
    [theColor set];
    [thePath fill];

}
</code></pre>

<p>@end</p>

<p>On startup, it draws a rectangle in the bottom left corner, like it should. The problem is, the <code>drawRect</code> method is only called on startup. It just won't fire no matter what I do.</p>

<p>EDIT: I have just updated the code. I hope it helps.</p>

<p>SECOND EDIT: I have <em>really</em> simplified the code. I hope this helps a bit more.</p>

Is there any way to do this?</p>

When I updated my <code>xampp</code> to <code>1.8.3</code> it started to send emails from my <code>localhost</code>. so I moved back to <code>1.8.1</code>,</p>

<p>recently I had to update to <code>1.8.3</code> due to some requirements. PHP version is <code>5.5.15</code>. It now started to send emails again.</p>

<p>My question is, How can I disable sending emails. and Can I do it on per project base, my application is having actual data on my <code>localhost</code>, and when ever QA team or other developers try updating the orders for a client, my client gets the email alerts, and this is causing lots of trouble.</p>

So my problem is that I want to load menus and footers from external HTML file so It would be easier later modify them. I can't use php or other server-side languages cause it's for school and I use it from usb stick.<br><br>
My current code goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;SchoolStuff&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src=""http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id=""header""&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;[Stuff here]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script &gt; 
     $(""#header"").load(""/header.html #header""); 
    &lt;/script&gt; ...
</code></pre>

<p><br>
and in the header.html it look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id=""header""&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt; Just a Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So do you guys have any ideas how to do this? It doesn't matter if you solve this in something else than jquery but it can't be server-side language. And IFrame doesn't work for this kind of purpose because I don't want the whole page. I just want specific parts.<br><br>
<b>EDIT:</b> ok it looks like it just wont work in chrome (which is really weird though)
so if you have any ideas to get it work in chrome too it would be appreciated
<br><b>EDIT 2:</b> I decided to put my site online so it's easier for everyone...</p>

<p>Firstly, there is a jQuery-related issue where the image swap delay incrementally decreases so that after an extended period of time the slideshow speeds up to the point where there is virtually no delay between images. I didn't want to tinker around in the s3Slider.js file because I thought I'd just make it worse.</p>

<p>Second, is there a way, perhaps using PHP sessions, to preserve the position of the slideshow (ie. the current image) between pages so that it doesn't just start over again each time you click a link? I'd like to have about a dozen images, but I feel that only the first few would ever be seen.</p>

<p>I have contacted the author, but he has not replied yet.</p>

I have a Panel on a Form where I want to display these bars and scroll and zoom them. The Form, and thus the Panel, can be resized. The bars are dynamically created from a database. Each time the user zooms in or out, all bars have to be created anew to adjust their sizes on the Panel.</p>

<p>I use Label controls to create these bars, but the problem applies to all other controls as well: If I zoom in far enough, my bars will eventually exceed the magic 16 bit border of control sizes (>65536 pixels). This makes it impossible to simply create all the controls on the panel at start and let the panel handle the scrolling.</p>

<p>My idea: Clear the Panel of all bar controls and create only the ones that are visible in the current view window, according to the current position of the scroll bars and the zoom level. The bars exceeding far from the visible view will be cut short just outside the Panel, so their maximum size is limited by the Panel size.</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>At which Panel event(s) should this clear/create process take place best?
There could be thousands of controls, so it should be as seldom as possible. </li>
<li>Is there a better way to handle this? Maybe I got it all wrong from the start.</li>
</ul>

<p>This problem arises not only with huge controls but also when smaller controls are very far apart (>65536 pixels) on a Panel, so I think a good solution may be helpful for many projects.</p>

<p>In an XML Layout I need to do the following:</p>

<p>I have a list view at the top (listViewProducts) , and another Relative view under it (receiptSection). </p>

<p>The list view should take as much space as it has items. And the rest is taken by the receiptSection.</p>

<p>So for example if I have 2 items in the listViewProducts:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qPXmD.png"" alt=""first image""></p>

<p>The list view is as big as the 2 items and the rest is taken by the receiptView.</p>

<p>If I add another item, the list view now take more space and push the receiptView lower:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/I7MrT.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>However if I add a lot more items, I want the list view height to stop growing to leave a minimum height for the receiptView that cannot go smaller:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/TDf2z.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you see in the picture, the receiptVIew has a minimum height of 50dp. once the receipt view get to that height, it should stop shrinking and now the list view has a fixed size based on the remaining of the space. The rest will be scrollable.</p>

<p><strong>What I have tried</strong></p>

<p>I created a list view. I have <code>android:layout_alignParentTop=""true""</code> and <code>android:layout_height=""wrap_content""</code>.</p>

<p>This will make it grow with its content and its at the top of the view</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListView
    android:id=""@+id/listViewProducts""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
    android:layout_alignParentTop=""true"" &gt;
&lt;/ListView&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>THen I created a RelativeLayout that will hold the checkout_receipt_view that is in a seperate xml layout file.</p>

<p>For this view I have <code>android:layout_alignParentBottom=""true""</code> and <code>android:layout_below=""@id/listViewProducts""</code> that will make it go under the list view and align with the bottom of the view.</p>

<p>I also used <code>android:minHeight=""50d""</code> in order to set the minimum height of the receiptSection.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;RelativeLayout
    android:id=""@+id/receiptSection""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:layout_alignParentBottom=""true""
    android:layout_below=""@id/listViewProducts""
    android:minHeight=""50dp"" &gt;
    &lt;include layout=""@layout/checkout_receipt_view"" /&gt;
&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The listViewProducts is growing with the items, and the receiptView is taking the remaining space correctly.</p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong>
however the minimum height did not work. The list view keeps on growing infinitely and the receiptSection will be pushed out of the view.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can make the listView stop growing when the receiptView reaches 50dp?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  the reason I have to find some way to ""transfer"" the <code>touchesEnded</code> is that the initial <code>touchesBegan</code> is received by a UIView that is removed as a subView at the same time the new UIView is added, so the <code>touchesEnded</code> actually fires immediately as the subView is removed.</p>

<p>What this does is to find the gallery, apply a wrapper around the gallery image and when hovering over the item it goes grayscale and you get a title div (with .caption class) on top of the existing gallery thumb.
The gallery consists of 9 thumbnails and the script applies the wrapper and caption to all existing gallery items however i only get the hover effect over the first thumbnail.</p>

<p>This is an example of the gallery HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""one-third column alpha""&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=""one-third column""&gt;
        &lt;a class=""fancybox"" rel=""group"" href=""../img/galeria/big2.jpg""&gt;&lt;img src=""../img/galeria/thumb2.jpg"" title=""t2""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=""one-third column omega""&gt;
        &lt;a class=""fancybox"" rel=""group"" href=""../img/galeria/big3.jpg""&gt;&lt;img src=""../img/galeria/thumb3.jpg"" title=""t3""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the CSS I've got:</p>

<pre><code>    #wrapperGal{

    position:relative;

    -moz-transition: 0.5s;  
    -o-transition: 0.5s;
    transition: 0.5s;
}

.galGrey{
    -webkit-filter: grayscale(100%);
}

.caption{
    height:190px;
    position:relative;
    top:20px;
    opacity:0;
    background-image:url(../img/galeria/thumbRoll.png);
}

<p>The Advance Custom Fields image upload is designed to upload an image to a specific 'issue', which is a custom taxonomy created by the IssueM plugin. I have successfully uploaded the image to Issue 01, which this URL suggests. I just can't return the correct path. </p>

In the form for <code>Task</code>, I want to put a subform for all the <code>Action</code>s related to the current task through the <code>ActionTask</code> junction table.</p>

<p>This, in itself, I can do.</p>

<p>The trick is that <code>Action</code> is actually the bottom rank of a four-tier hierarchy of tables.
Each <code>Action</code> belongs to a <code>Goal</code>, each <code>Goal</code> belongs to a <code>Theme</code>, each <code>Theme</code> belongs to a <code>Strategy</code>.</p>

<p>Rather than just have a combo box listing all the available <code>Action</code>s, I'd like to use cascading combo boxes for the <code>Strategy</code>/<code>Theme</code>/<code>Goal</code>/<code>Action</code>.</p>

<p>This I can also do.</p>

<p>The problem is when I use this technique in a datasheet, if I select a given row, the selected row shows the proper <code>Strategy</code>/<code>Theme</code>/<code>Goal</code>/<code>Action</code>, but in all the other rows</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>Action</code> is blank</li>
<li>the <code>Strategy</code>/<code>Theme</code>/<code>Goal</code> is set to the current row's values, rather than that row's values</li>
</ul>

<p>I think I know why (the <code>Me.StrategyCombo = ...</code> stuff in my <code>Form_Current</code> callback), but I don't know another way to achieve that.</p>

<p>How can I make the subform display all the rows properly?</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> My main struggle is that there does not seem to be a lot of support/help in this area. I have been using <a href=""https://github.com/LazarSoft/jsqrcode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/LazarSoft/jsqrcode</a>, which seems to work if I upload a direct image of a QR code, but when I add whitespace to the code, or take a picture of it, it does not work. However, everything seems to work fine on the website that it is implemented on (<a href=""http://www.webqr.com/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webqr.com/index.html</a>). 
I essentially used the ""test' file in his git source then modified it a tiny bit so that it read the image I display on the website.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Can someone help me figure out if I need to include more of his libraries, or how I can go about getting my QR reader to decipher less visible QR Codes, or those taken within a camera? The webqr.com website works just fine, but his test file does not seem to have the same power implemented within it.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You can test my current setup at <a href=""http://aawebapps.com/echo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aawebapps.com/echo/</a>. Uploading a perfect QR image works fine, like (<em>Example of working QR Code</em> <a href=""http://imgur.com/BaN8zkc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/BaN8zkc</a>), but if there is any whitespace added, or if you give it an image taken with a camera (using your phone on the website), then it does not work. (<em>Example of whitespace not making it work</em> <a href=""http://imgur.com/twnCH4x"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/twnCH4x</a>).</p>

<ul>
<li>Note: when you add another image, it won't erase the last number code shown if the new image has an error. (I will update that tonight when I am home)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> The goal is for a user to bring up the website on their mobile device (most likely phone), then scan a QR Code or Barcode and then display its embedded number.</p>

I've recently taken on a project that another developer had been working on up until now, he's using mercurial and his workflow with regards to version control has been as follows:</p>

<p><em>Do site edits direct to the development version of the site. Once an issue/feature is completed this can be committed to the development branch Once a collection of modifications has been completed, deemed safe/approved and ready for live, they can be put so by first pushing the changes on dev up to bitbucket and then sshing to the live server, pulling them down, and merging the development changes back into the live branch, and committing the merge.</em></p>

<p>The problem that I've found is somewhere along the line the development version has began to differ significantly to the live version of the site. As this is the case I won't be able to merge the changes I'm making from the development site/branch to the live version. To make this workflow viable I'm going to need the development version to be an exact copy of the live version once again.</p>

<p>To accomplish this I'm (so far unsuccessfully) searching for a way to commit a full version of both branches that can be reverted back to if needed, then to merge/replace the development version of the site with the current live site so that they are identical.</p>

<p>If this is at all possible, how? Also open to any suggestions/improvements, thanks. </p>

<p>I did some research on dynamic solutions for subset sum problems; however, I think this specific problem presents a twist. </p>

<p>Adding two binary numbers with length Y and restricting the sum's length to Y will sometimes subtract 2^(Y) from the sum (if there is overflow). Since adding two binary numbers sometimes causes overflow, such as adding:</p>

<pre><code>10000000000000000000000000000000000000010
10000000000000000000000000000000000000010

<p>Will yield the sum</p>

<pre><code>00000000000000000000000000000000000000100
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, in some cases adding numbers will actually lower the current sum.</p>

<p>At the moment, I am banging my head into a wall. Any tips or pointers how to attack this specific version of the subset sum problem?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>There are no real limitations to what I can use. My only goal is to produce the fastest possible run-time with ~50 binary numbers of length ~40</p>
