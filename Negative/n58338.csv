<p>In HTML the slideshow is a ul with each li containing one image. The li elements have the classes ""featured"" and ""slide_number_n"" with n being the number of the slide (i.e. slide_number_1, slide_number_2 etc).</p>

<p>So the slideshow would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class=""slideshow_container""&gt;
  &lt;li class=""featured slide_number_1"" style=""display:block""&gt;&lt;img src=""foo.jpg"" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=""featured slide_number_2"" style=""display:none""&gt;&lt;img src=""bar.jpg"" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If I look at the print version of the page (of course) it contains all the images from the slideshow, but our customer wants only the first display shown, so I tried changing it to do just that. But if I open the print version AFTER the first image has been displayed in the slideshow, I see no image at all, because the JS has overriden all the display values inline. I cannot get these JS changes reversed, not even using <code>!important</code> and <code>li[style]</code> in my print.css.</p>

<p>Is there a way to reverse the changes made by JS in the print.css?</p>

<p>Thank you and regards,
Julian</p>

<p>I want to directly modify a bit in a byte.</p>

<p>In GCC, you can do it as follow:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>struct virtualByte {
    unsigned char b0 : 1;
    unsigned char b1 : 1;
    unsigned char b2 : 1;
    unsigned char b3 : 1;
    unsigned char b4 : 1;
    unsigned char b5 : 1;
    unsigned char b6 : 1;
    unsigned char b7 : 1;
} __attribute__((__packed__));

#define sbit(_byte, _pos) (((volatile struct virtualByte *)&amp;_byte)-&gt;b ## _pos)
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>unsigned char myByte = 0x00;

#define firstBit sbit(myByte, 0)

firstBit = 1; // Implicit myByte |= 0x01;
</code></pre>

<p>To make things neater I want to have class that does this for me. I came up with the following concept:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>unsigned char myByteRef = 0x00;

Byte myByte(&amp;myByteRef);

myByte[0] = 1; // Implicit myByteRef |= 0x01;

fprintf(stderr, ""%2.2X\n"", myByteRef);
</code></pre>

<p>But this does not work because in c++ you cannot return a reference to a single bit. Overloading the constructor does not work either.</p>

<p>Is there a possibility to implement such behaviour? The assignment operator should directly modify its underlying byte (not a set of bytes).</p>

<li>self.serial2player is a dict which maps serials to Player objects</li>

<p>Storing the Document works without any problems. The Document and the File-Document are stored in MongoDB. When I'm loading the <code>Document</code> the <code>$originalFile</code> property is <code>null</code>. I have no clue what's missing. Is the mapping wrong or is this simply a bug in Doctrine?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>This is how I'm storing the documents:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>//create if not exists
if ($documentObj === null) {
    $documentObj = new Document();
    $documentObj-&gt;setCreated(new \DateTime());

} else {
    $documentObj-&gt;setModified(new \DateTime());

    $file = $documentObj-&gt;getOriginalFile();
}
$file-&gt;setFile($pathToFile);
//set file
$documentObj-&gt;setOriginalFile($file);
//set import source
$documentObj-&gt;setImportSource($source);
//store document
$documents[] = $this-&gt;storeDocument($documentObj, $documentFields);

<p>I am posting the makefile itself to make matter more clear. Please, excuse me that the names are not in English, however in this case this shouldn't be a problem. I've updated the error message so that it fits the makefile.</p>

Since there are severe restrictions for space, the user does not want to use a mouse so the entire GUI will be controlled via taps on the screen. Tapping buttons is equivalent with clicking them. Similarly, clicking an item into a data grid is similar to tapping it. However, if I want to drill down and see details, I need to double-click on the item and I can handle DataGrid's MouseAction LeftDoubleClick event. Tapping twice on the item though is not the same. Of course, I can add a button ""See Details"" on the form and tap it once an item is selected. Before I do that, I just want to know if there is a way to handle the ""double-tap on the touchscreen"" event? Is there a way to transform that into the LeftDoubleClick event?</p>

My emails, which are sent in HTML format, might have images embedded. The images are pre-defined and live in known locations. Naturally, <strong>email read from the (public) internet can't load images hosted in the (private) closed network; email read from the closed network can't load images from the internet</strong>.</p>

<p>For now, during email generation we are determining from the recipient's email address whether we should set the <code>img src</code> to be the public or private path. <strong>I'd love to find a native HTML technique that could tell the email client ""try this public path to the image, and if it doesn't load failover to this private path"".</strong> My understanding is that email clients are almost always expected to strip-out JavaScript, so ECMA won't be a part of this solution. Sadly.</p>

<h2>Attempt 1</h2>

<p>I tried setting the <code>src</code> to be the public path to the image, and set the <code>background-image</code> style attribute to be the private path to the image:</p>

<p><code>&lt;img src=""path/to/</code><strong><code>public</code></strong><code>/my_image.jpg"" style=""background-image:url('path/to/</code><strong><code>private</code></strong><code>/my_image.jpg');"" ..etc.. /&gt;</code></p>

<p>That works great in a browser (especially if height/width attributes are set), but Outlook (2007) does not support <code>background-image</code>. So, no joy.</p>

<p>Two Statements from Docs :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1)
  Future versions of Android (beyond Android 2.0.1) will no longer check or enforce the 
  maxSdkVersion attribute during installation or re-validation. Google Play will continue to 
  use the attribute as a filter, however, when presenting users with applications available for >download.</p>
  
  <p>2) WARNING:</p>
  
  <p>note that in some cases, declaring the attribute can result in your application being 
  removed from users' devices after a system update to a higher API Level. Most devices on which your >application is likely to be installed will receive periodic system updates over 
  the air, so you should consider their effect on your application before setting this attribute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can some one make me clear the above two statements.</p>

based on the ""Product"" entity, this from has a field called ""ProductCriteria"", which is a collection based on ""ProductCriteriaType"" (Form).</p>

<p>My productCriteria Model hold a ""deleted"" attribute that handles the logic suppression of this entity. If it is set to true, then i dont want the productCriteria form type to be display in the product Form Type. If it is set to false, then i want to display it in the product Form Type, you get it.</p>

<p>I have written this in the PRE_SET_DATA event of my form, which works incredibly well:</p>

<pre><code>$builder-&gt;addEventListener(FormEvents::PRE_SET_DATA, function(FormEvent $event) {
            $product = $event-&gt;getData();


        /** @var PersistentCollection $productCriteriasFields */
        $productCriteriasFields = $product-&gt;getProductCriterias();

        /** @var ProductCriteria $productCriteria */
        foreach($productCriteriasFields as $productCriteria){
            if($productCriteria-&gt;getDeleted()){
                $productCriteriasFields-&gt;removeElement($productCriteria);
            }
        }

    });
</code></pre>

<p>My fields are set to true/false in the form and when I access the FormType it doesnt display the delete-true one as expected.</p>

<p>THE ONLY PROBLEM IS:
When I just modified a 'deleted' value, the controller doesnt redirect to another page when the form isValid(). It just renders the FormType again, and the form DOESNT CONTAIN MY MODIFICATIONS (but they are in DB !). If I refresh the page (F5), I have in deed the modifications I want.
How to solve this ? I tried to add a 'POST_SUBMIT' function, working on the form fields like this:</p>

<pre><code>$builder-&gt;addEventListener(FormEvents::POST_SUBMIT, function(FormEvent $event){

                    /** @var Product $data */
                    $product = $event-&gt;getForm()-&gt;getData(); //this was supposed to do the trick
                    $form = $event-&gt;getForm();

                /** @var ProductCriteria $productCriteria */
                for($i = 0; $i &lt; count($product-&gt;getProductCriterias()); $i++){
                    if($product-&gt;getProductCriterias()[$i]-&gt;getDeleted()){
                        ladybug_dump(""unsetting one field ! "");
                        unset($form-&gt;get('productCriterias')[$i]);
                    }
                }
</code></pre>

<p>But nothing works. Any idea? Thanks a LOT.</p>

<p>EDIT
Controller's code (it is an abstracted one: archi of my project, not a choice):</p>

<pre><code>/** @var EditableEntityInterface $entity */
$entity = $this-&gt;entityService-&gt;getEntityById($itemId);
$form = $this-&gt;createForm('admin' . $this-&gt;entityService-&gt;getEntityName(), $entity);

$form-&gt;handleRequest($this-&gt;get('request'));
$submitSuccess = false;
if ($form-&gt;isValid()) {
    $this-&gt;entityService-&gt;save($form-&gt;getData());
    $submitSuccess = true;
}

$template = $this-&gt;getActionTemplate($this-&gt;entityService-&gt;getEditTemplate());

return $this-&gt;render($template, array(
    'item' =&gt; $entity,
    'form' =&gt; $form-&gt;createView(),

<p>In the first Computer Science class I took, the professor used C++ as a teaching language.  He emphasized that the important things to understand are the concepts of programming, not just the language itself.</p>

<p>In the past few years, I've fallen in to a career in database driven web development.  At first, I was busy learning to use the server-side programming tools, namely ASP.net.  Most of my fellow co-workers from my early days didn't use much client-side scripting code, but I've been making a big effort to learn to write good client side scripting.</p>

<p>I've begun using jQuery in earnest.</p>

<p>The first thing that most any C++ or .net developer will notice about JavaScript upon first encountering it is that the syntax is remarkably similar to C-style languages.</p>

<p>There are important differences.  JavaScript uses variant data types, allows for arrays to be declared in-line, and uses it's own object syntax with curly braces.  Above all, JavaScript is an interpreted language that allows for a user to interact with a ""document-object-model"" using a web browser which C++ is typically compiled into native code (or sometimes managed code).  It would be silly to make more than a superficial comparison of the two languages.</p>

<p>What I would like to ask is, ""As I learn to write JavaScript code, part of my mind can't help but think of it as being like C code because it looks like C code.  What mistakes am I likely making on account of this?  What useful features of the language am I likely not using?""</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> I edited my question title because it's clear that my old title was ambiguous :-/</p>

|  1 |       1 | b    |    12 |

<p>The events arrive in batches and I would like to create the transaction by summing up the values for each transid, like:</p>

<pre><code>select transid, sum(value) from eventtable group by transid;
</code></pre>

<p>but only after all the events for that transid have arrived. That is determined by the event with the code e (b for the beginning, e for the end and i for varying amount of intermediates).  Being a novice in SQL, how could I implement the requirement for the existance of the end code before the summing?</p>

<p>once the user presses the button, i need to check if it is already in the highlighted state  and accordingly perform some action. But, the state of the button is getting changed automatically  after it is being pressed. I think this is the default behavior of a UIButton. Is there any way in which i can first check wether the button is already in the highlighted state???</p>

<p>ws/</p>

<p>ws/lookupTransaction</p>

<p>Ideally I'd like anything with a 'ws/' prefix to go to the WebServiceController and match the action name. I'm not sure how to do that yet but I am trying to get each route working so I added these two routes:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

class Bootstrap extends Zend_Application_Bootstrap_Bootstrap
{

    function _initRoutes()
    {
        $frontController = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
        $router = $frontController-&gt;getRouter();

        $router-&gt;addRoute('ws', new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('ws/', array(
            'controller'    =&gt;  'web-service',
            'action'        =&gt;  'index',
        )));

        $router-&gt;addRoute('ws/lookupTransaction', new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('ws/lookupTransaction', array(
            'controller'    =&gt;  'web-service',
            'action'        =&gt;  'lookup-transaction',
        )));
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>The first one works as expected but the second one doesn't, I just get 'Application Error'. What am I doing wrong? Just out of interest, if I remove my two routes and try and go to:</p>

<p>web-service/lookup-transaction</p>

<p>I still get the same error!</p>

<h1>Solved</h1>

<p>Here is how I can make it work with camel cased action name and camel cased URL.</p>

<pre><code>$router-&gt;addRoute('ws', new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('ws/:action', array(
    'controller'    =&gt;  'web-service',
    'action'        =&gt;  'index',
)));
$router-&gt;addRoute('ws-lookupTransaction', new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('ws/lookupTransaction', array(
    'controller'    =&gt;  'web-service',
    'action'        =&gt;  'lookup-transaction',
)));

<p>when the button (link) with these values are clicked ,it will show a modal window , but it is always showing the first value for all buttons ( green always ) with index value as 0.

<p><strong>Premise 2:</strong> I am developing a web calendar. The calendar is divided in weeks, and features two main parts: a <strong>navigator</strong> (displays the weeks) and a list of <strong>categories</strong> (each category contains some event, and empty cells for the days) See a very basic version <a href=""http://codepen.io/simonedavico/pen/nlxam?editors=110"" rel=""nofollow"">in this pen</a>.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>I am using <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes"" rel=""nofollow"">flexible boxes</a> in order to develop a layout that adapts to window resize.
My problem is that the navigator's cells (days) and categories' cells (empty placeholders) do not align vertically in the expected way:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/o8Cmu.png"" alt=""Days and placeholder should be aligned!""></p>

<p>As you can see, the cells are not aligned properly. I thought that the problem could reside in the fact that the layout of a category wasn't exactly like the layout of the navigator, since the navigator is divided in weeks. Thus, I divided also empty placeholders in the category, but with no luck.</p>

<h2>The layout</h2>

<p>The layour exploits also bootstrap's grid system, and is organized like this (I'll put only the classes, since they are all <code>div</code>s):</p>

<pre><code>.row .navigator     &lt;--------------------&gt;   .row .category
    .col-1 .navigator-header  &lt;-------------&gt;    .col-1 .category-header
    .col-11 .navigator-content   &lt;----------&gt;    .col-11 .category-content
         .week        &lt;-------------------------&gt;    .category-group
            .week-header                                (nothing here)
            .days    &lt;-------------------------&gt;        .cells
</code></pre>

<p>I put arrows to associate the elements of a category and the navigator. The only difference is the presence of a <code>week-header</code>, but it doesn't have sizes set so SHOULDN'T be relevant. You can check the CSS in the pen, it's really simple.</p>

<h2>The question</h2>

<p>The question is: <strong>why are the elements aligned differently? What am I ignoring here?</strong> </p>

<p>In case you need more information, just let me know. Thank you.</p>

<p>My problem is that the server does not receive the attributes of the form button they clicked if that form button calls up the modal. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button class=""btn btn-danger confirm-delete"" name=""action"" type=""submit"" value=""-1""&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I need the <code>value</code> attribute to be accessible to my server in order to properly process the form (as the other button has another <code>value</code> attribute).</p>

<p>Without, the server recieves this when the user presses the button:</p>

<pre><code>[('action', u'0'), ('process-csrf_token', u'1399148515.12##374d9bc0ce1d7f3b30b1865ad592d0c43ada0b7b'), ('process-selection', u'1'), ('process-submitted', u'true')]
</code></pre>

<p>With the modal, the server receives this when the user presses the button and presses the confirm button:</p>

<pre><code>[('process-csrf_token', u'1399148054.19##8d8a9913e2a8e6259b477e49c05a3d326fd935be'), ('process-selection', u'1'), ('process-submitted', u'true')]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How can I make the original button's attributes be sent to the server?</strong></p>

<p>Here's my javascript:</p>

<pre><code>$('button.confirm-delete').on('click', function(e){
    console.log(""foo"")
    var $form=$(this).closest('form');
    e.preventDefault();
    $('#confirmDelete').modal({ backdrop: 'static', keyboard: false })
        .one('click', '#confirm', function (e) {
            $form.trigger('submit');
        });
});
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the modal:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""modal fade"" id=""confirmDelete"" role=""dialog"" aria-labelledby=""confirmDeleteLabel"" aria-hidden=""true""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""modal-dialog""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""modal-content""&gt;

The only other method I can think of that would work is to use OCR of the screen, with specific fixed regions.</p>

<p>All the OCR solutions I have checked out seem to be file based (PDF, TIFF, etc). What I really need is an OCR solution that can capture from the screen. A few challenges I can think of: The text to be captured is on a black background and could be colored text (yellow, green, red, orange). The text size is also pretty small (6pt's I think).</p>

"7066274","1","7066757","","2011-08-15 14:41:23","","8","7357","<p>I'm trying to write a very simple custom configuration section for a .NET4 application. My goal is this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;configSections&gt;
    &lt;section name=""myServices"" type=""My.ConfigSection, My.Assembly"" /&gt;
  &lt;/configSections&gt;
  &lt;myServices&gt;
    &lt;add name=""First"" /&gt;
    &lt;add name=""Second"" /&gt;
  &lt;/myServices&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, I keep getting a <code>ConfigurationErrorsException</code>: 'Unrecognized element 'add'' when I call <code>ConfigurationManager.GetSection(""myServices"")</code>. I've been staring at it for a while now but haven't figured out yet what I'm doing wrong. Below is my code. It's three classes: <code>ConfigSection</code>, <code>MyServiceSettingsCollection</code> and <code>MyServiceSettings</code>.</p>

<p>First the class that represents the entire config section. It has a nameless default collection of type <code>MyServiceSettingsCollection</code>. The <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms134297.aspx""><code>IsDefaultCollection</code></a> property should allow me to 'add' directly to my collection from the root element.</p>

<pre><code>public sealed class ConfigSection : ConfigurationSection
{
  private static readonly ConfigurationProperty _propMyServices;

  private static readonly ConfigurationPropertyCollection _properties;

  public static ConfigSection Instance { get { return _instance; } }

  static ConfigSection()
  {
    _propMyServices = new ConfigurationProperty(
          null, typeof(MyServiceSettingsCollection), null,
          ConfigurationPropertyOptions.IsDefaultCollection);
    _properties = new ConfigurationPropertyCollection { _propMyServices };
  }

  [ConfigurationProperty("""", IsDefaultCollection = true)]
  public MyServiceSettingsCollection MyServices
  {
    get { return (MyServiceSettingsCollection) base[_propMyServices]; }
    set { base[_propMyServices] = value; }
  }

  protected override ConfigurationPropertyCollection Properties
  { get { return _properties; } }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next, the collection class itself. It is of type <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.configuration.configurationelementcollectiontype.aspx""><code>AddRemoveClearMap</code></a>.</p>

<pre><code>[ConfigurationCollection(typeof(MyServiceSettings),
    CollectionType = ConfigurationElementCollectionType.AddRemoveClearMap)]
public sealed class MyServiceSettingsCollection : ConfigurationElementCollection
{
  public MyServiceSettings this[int index]
  {
    get { return (MyServiceSettings) BaseGet(index); }
    set
    {
      if (BaseGet(index) != null) { BaseRemoveAt(index); }
      BaseAdd(index, value);
    }
  }

  public new MyServiceSettings this[string key]
  {
    get { return (MyServiceSettings) BaseGet(key); }
  }

  protected override ConfigurationElement CreateNewElement()
  {
    return new MyServiceSettings();
  }

  protected override object GetElementKey(ConfigurationElement element)
  {
    return ((MyServiceSettings) element).Key;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And finally a class for the elements in the collection. For now, this class has one property but there will be more later (which prevents me from using <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.configuration.namevaluesectionhandler.aspx""><code>NameValueSectionHandler</code></a>).</p>

<pre><code>public class MyServiceSettings : ConfigurationElement
{
  private static readonly ConfigurationProperty _propName;

  private static readonly ConfigurationPropertyCollection properties;

  static MyServiceSettings()
  {
    _propName = new ConfigurationProperty(""name"", typeof(string), null, null,

                                          ConfigurationPropertyOptions.IsKey);
    properties = new ConfigurationPropertyCollection { _propName };
  }

    $event.stopPropagation();
    $event.preventDefault();

  }
})

<p>... and in this case i can use the shorthand expression for if statement like @Emmanuel mentioned.</p>

<p>I have modified my script to ignore the file extension I want ignored, however it no longer populates the window with all of the other file types containted in the folder. But when I take out the file I want ignore from the folder, the window gets populated as it should.</p>

<p>This is what I have at the moment that checks my folder for the file types:</p>

<pre><code>//Prompt for folder location
var Path = Folder.selectDialog(""Select Folder Location for Renders"")
// Use the path to the application and append the samples folder 
var samplesFolder = Folder(Path)
//Get the files 
var fileList = samplesFolder.getFiles()
//Creat Array to hold names
var renderTypes = new Array();
//Parse Initial name to get similar render elements
var beautyRender = fileList[0].name
beautyRender = beautyRender.substr(0, beautyRender.length-4)


//Get the render elements with a similar name
for (var i = 0; i &lt; fileList.length; i++)
{
  var filename = fileList[i].name;
   if (filename.match(/\.(stitchinfo)$/i) == null) 
   {
      if(fileList[i].name.substring(0,beautyRender.length) === beautyRender)
      {
        renderTypes.push(fileList[i].name); 
      }
   }
 } 
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone see what I've done wrong and need to modify?</p>

<p><em>Update</em> 
I'm still trying to get this to work and following the help from one of the posters below I have modified my code to the following:</p>

<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; fileList.length; i++)
{
  var filename = fileList[i].name;
   if (filename.match(/\.(stitchinfo)$/i) == null) 
   {
        renderTypes.push(fileList[i].name); 
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, with this new code comes a new problem in that it returns every file contained in the folders and displays it. </p>

<p>I'm still stumped as to how I can get this to work as I would like. Please can anyone help me?</p>

Everything works normally on my version of IE8 and any version I've been able to test.</p>

<p>The problem: My site isn't working properly in my client's version of IE8. The error messages they reported indicate that jQuery is not getting loaded, which (not surprisingly) is breaking scripts left and right. They assure me that there is no firewall preventing jquery from getting loaded from an external site. I also had them confirm that Active Scripting is enabled under Internet Options. I'm running out of ideas for why <em>their</em> IE8 isn't working but mine is.</p>

<p>They're on Windows XP. Here's the full version number of their IE8 I was given: v8.06001.18702c0 128bit</p>

<p>Does anyone know of what might be happening? Do I need to somehow try to track down that EXACT version?</p>

<p>The client showed me this screenshot of an error message. I checked each line referenced and it's basically throwing erros as soon as jQuery is referenced in those scripts.

<p>""AAA,15.0""
""BBB,45.0""
""CCC,60.0""</p>

<p>I then want to process this data, adding another column to get something formatted as follows:</p>

<p>""AAA,15.0,50.0""
""BBB,45.0,30.0""
""CCC,60.0,20.0""</p>

<p>So.......
I open the original file into Python using:</p>

<pre><code>with open((FilePath""/XXX.csv""), 'rt') as csvfile:
   NewData = list(csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=';'))

print(NewData)
</code></pre>

<p>The first time I do this the code produces a list of strings (which I'm actually happy about - I want this format)...</p>

<p>['AAA,15.0,50.0', 'BBB,45.0,30.0', 'CCC,60.0,20.0']</p>

<p>But then next time I try to add a column I end up with....</p>

<p>[['AAA,15.0,50.0'], ['BBB,45.0,30.0'], ['CCC,60.0,20.0']]</p>

<p>So, each time my code runs it adds an additional layer of 'listing'.</p>

<p>What do I need to do to keep the initial formatting of a list of strings? I imagine it's because I'm opening the file with the list() command. What should I be using?</p>

<hr>

<p>Further details as requested.........</p>

<p>Distilling this further...My code is...</p>

<pre><code>import csv

FilePathSB=""C:/Users/""

with open((FilePathSB+""/Master.csv""), 'rt') as csvfile:

   xMatrix = list(csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=';'))

####Do something to the data like add another column of numbers                                                      

#SaveAs same file

with open(FilePathSB+""/Master.csv"", ""w"") as output:
   writer=csv.writer(output,lineterminator='\n')
   for val in xMatrix:
      writer.writerow([val])

<p>Note that there is some data manipulation that occurs while the file is open but this doesn't impact the problem I have so I've left the code out.</p>

<p>Opening the file and then saving it is adding a layer of 'listing' each time the code runs. I'd like the formatting to remain unchanged (ie so despite being opened and then resaved I'd like the data format to be the same as the initial matrix shown below).</p>

<p>So the first time the code runs it opens the initial csv data of: </p>

<pre><code>""AAA,24:17""
""BBB,21:18""
""CCC,16:40""
</code></pre>

<p>and changes the format to saves it as:</p>

<pre><code>""['AAA,24:17']""
""['BBB,21:18']""
""['CCC,16:40']""
</code></pre>

<p>If I run the code again it takes this data and changes it to:</p>

<pre><code>""[""""['AAA,24:17']""""]""
""[""""['BBB,21:18']""""]""
""[""""['CCC,16:40']""""]""
</code></pre>

<p>And if I run it again I end up with:</p>

<pre><code>""['[""""[\'AAA,24:17\']""""]']""
""['[""""[\'BBB,21:18\']""""]']""
""['[""""[\'CCC,16:40\']""""]']""

<p>I have a service method which returns a stream (a MemoryStream, in the end) and which I'd like to consume in the website.</p>

<p>But whenever I create my client and call this method, an Exception occurs :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The socket connection was aborted. This could be caused by an error processing your message or a receive timeout being exceeded by the remote host, or an underlying network resource issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are no exceptions in my server, which returns the stream as it should.</p>

<p>I have read about quotas in similar posts, but shouldn't it apply only to the buffered mode?</p>

<p>Do you have any clue about how to solve this problem?</p>

<p>Moreover, as a 2nd point, I would like to know if it is still possible for a service configured as a streamed one to return objects, as usual; having in the end some methods returning streams, and other returning objects.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance !</p>

"26038697","1","","","2014-09-25 12:28:58","","0","249","<h1>The Situation</h1>

<p>We have a board with a TI DM3730 processor (also known from the Beagleboard) with a Cortex A8 core (r3p2) in use with the following parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Beagleboard Reference Design: Beagleboard-xM Rev-C</li>
<li>Kernel version: 3.2.8</li>
<li>Open CV library: 2.4.6</li>
<li>U-Boot: uboot-2013.04 </li>
<li>Toolchain: Sourcery CodeBench ARM 2011.03</li>
<li>Buildroot: 2012.02</li>
<li>The setup is derived from <a href=""http://blog.galemin.com/2012/03/buildroot-2012-02-for-beagleboard-xm-with-li-5m03-mt9p031-camera-support/"" rel=""nofollow"">this blog</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have written a program (written in C++ and compiled with GCC Version 4.5.2.) which uses the OpenCV library (to calculate some scores using support vector machines) and which behaves in some strange way:</p>

<ol>
<li>The program runs on the board in its own process using defined test data: It produces repeatedly correct results.</li>
<li>The program runs in two or more processes (with the same defined test data): The results start to become wrong for each process, processes die with segfaults. The last remaining process runs correctly again.</li>
<li>The program runs in its own process (with the same defined test data again). Additionally, another process changes some exposure settings of an attached camera: The program starts to produce wrong results.</li>
</ol>

<p>So we assume this is a very low level floating point problem.</p>

<h2>What we tried</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The complete system (all libraries, kernel, boot loader, etc.) have been compiled with compiler flags as suggested on the pandorawiki.org regarding Floating_Point_Optimization </p>

<p>-O3 -mcpu=cortex-a8 -mfpu=neon -ftree-vectorize -mfloat-abi=softfp 
-ffast-math -fsingle-precision-constant</p></li>
<li><p>We tried to enable L1NEON in Cortex-A8 aux ctrl register according to the <a href=""http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardFAQ"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Beagle Board FAQ"">Beagle board FAQ</a> and tried the other options mentioned there as well, but unfortunately to no avail.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All three different behaviors are reproducible, but not in the form of a minimal working example.</p>

<p>The same program source and the first and second scenario run correctly on Windows (using Visual Studio) and on a desktop running Linux (GCC), so it's probably not something our code does.</p>

<p>So the questions are now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any other known bugs with this setup and floating point operations which we are not aware of?</li>
<li>Are there any known compiler options which should be set or omitted which can lead to the observed results?</li>
</ul>

<p>If a MWE would be helpful, we will look into providing one.</p>

<p>Any clues are welcome.</p>

<p>the description comes from:</p>

<pre><code>$n_desc = $row['descrizione'];

<p>then it comes all the xml sent, the description part is:</p>

of course if I send a description string like ""description"", all goes good.</p>

<pre>    entered into Perl Function  
    int variable from dll=10  
    array first element from dll=    
    final value=0  </pre>

<p>So the program is entering into 'Perl_Func' being called from the dll. But inside this function, it is unable to access the values in the array passed as a pointer (variable <code>c</code> in dll and <code>$a</code> in 'Perl_Func') from the dll. Therefore no value is being displayed for <code>$a[0]</code> and final value i.e. the summation of 1,2 and 3 is coming out to be zero. <strong>I guess I am not extracting the values from pointer to array, passed from C section, correctly in the Perl section.</strong> Please tell me the proper way to do that.</p>

<p>a) Even if inside CSS file we don’t specify a <em>margin property</em> for a particular block ( like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> ), browser still displays it as if this block has a linebreak before and after it.

<li><p>I would assume that if I add ( inside CSS file ) to a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element  a margin property with a value of <em>1px</em>, then space below and above <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>  should be increased by one pixel? So if <em>dS</em> consists of <em>15</em> pixels, then new space should have the height of <em>16</em> pixels? </p></li>

Namely, if I assign a value of <em>11px</em> to <em>margin property</em>, space above and below <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> doesn’t appear to have the height of <em>26</em> pixels ( <em>dS + 11px = 15px + 11px = 26px</em>). In fact, the height appears to be  the same as when <em>margin property</em> was assigned a value of <em>1px</em>. </p></li>
<li><p>So it would seem that until <em>margin property</em> is assigned a value equal or greater to some predetermined number, the <em>margin property</em> is simply ignored and <em>dS</em> is used instead?</p></li>

<p>I can see 3 options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make use of RestFB API directly from Java. But I'm not clear on how my app would interact with the internet browser (e.g. for the user to login to facebook).</li>
<li>Have my java app open a browser on the apps' website (my PHP server) and make use of Facebook's PHP SDK (but this case has the disadvantage of creating extra load on my server)</li>
<li>Same approach than (2) but use Facebook's Javascript SDK (in this case I'm not sure how to publish a picture that is stored locally)</li>
</ol>

<p>From what I understood so far, option (3) seems the easiest (no server load, no app token needed, etc.).</p>

<p>To be clear, this is the method call in question:</p>

<pre><code>Cells.Find(SearchString, LookIn:=xlFormulas, LookAt:=xlWhole)
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>If the cell containing SearchString is merely hidden, Range.Find works.</li>
<li>If the cell containing SearchString is merely part of a filtered range (but not hidden), Range.Find works.</li>
<li>If the cell containing SearchString is both hidden (by a filter or otherwise), AND is part of a filtered range, Range.Find fails.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many sources on various Excel sites and forums claim that specifying ""LookIn:=xlFormulas"" will force Range.Find to search within hidden cells. Though nonsensical, that seems to be true if SearchString is in a cell that is <em>merely</em> hidden. If the cell is <em>both</em> hidden and part of a filtered range, it fails.</p>

<p>Note that it doesn't matter if the cell is being hidden <em>by the filter</em>. For example, you can search for the <em>heading</em> of a filtered range (which will never be hidden by the filter itself), but if that heading happens to be in a column you've hidden, Range.Find will fail.</p>

<p>Is there any Excel method that will just reliably search cells without regard for whether or not they happen to be hidden and/or part of a filter?</p>

<p>I am hoping someone can help me.   I have created an SSRS (2012) report plotting multiple series over time.  The chart is shown above.   Many of the non-connected points are easily 'joined up' by making the empty point value the same color and size as the line itself.   I have demonstrated that with MC113.   This is all fine - and I have found plenty of helpful information on the web to help me address this.   The problem I am having is with the leading (and sometimes it is the lagging) horizontal line (circled).  This is where the data, from that series, does not start or end at the same point as the rest of the data (the example above appears to start in 2009, where as the remainder of the data starts in 2005).   </p>

<p>The data set is derived from a query and these points are being returned as NULL values.  How can I remove this line - so that in this case - the line would start from 2009?   I have tried filtering - but that will just truncate the all the series (to 2009) rather than just filtering MC113.  </p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions?  Perhaps I need to work on how present data from my query?  </p>

What I'm trying to implement is simple:
I have two textboxes on the screen.In textbox1, I type in a number and click on the submit button.This submit button should perform an ajax request and then return a 'template' html which allows me to display the square of the number in textbox2.</p>

<p>Please help in understanding the naming conventions for the template/partial which is to be displayed when the ajax request is made</p>

<p>I know this question sounds incredibly dumb but rails is a tough framework to learn for a person who is a beginner to web development and I was unable to find a single tutorial on the internet which does this simple functionality. All the existing tutorials focus on retrieving data from the database which increases complexity and leaves me even more confused. The more I learn about rails, the more I realize that there is a lot more to learn.</p>

<p>I would appreciate detailed instructions on how to perform this task. If you feel that this question should be closed then please redirect me to some website where beginners are allowed to post questions.</p>

<pre><code>cfg = { 'debug': 1, 'verbose': 1, 'cfgfile': 'my.cfg' }
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>ConfigParser</code> I parse a config file that can be used to override hard-coded values defined in <code>cfg</code> above and merge them as follows:</p>

<pre><code>config = SafeConfigParser()
config.read(cfg['cfgfile'])
cfg.update(dict(config.items('Main')))
</code></pre>

<p>The above all works correctly.</p>

<p>I now call a function that uses <code>optparse</code> to parse command line arguments.</p>

<pre><code>def parseOptions():
    parser = OptionParser()
    parser.add_option(""-d"", """", dest=""debug"",        action=""store_true"",             default=False, help=""enable additional debugging output"")
    parser.add_option(""-v"", """", dest=""verbose"",      action=""store_true"",             default=False, help=""enable verbose console output"")

    (options, args) = parser.parse_args()

    return options
</code></pre>

<p>Back in <code>main()</code>, <code>options</code> appears to be a dictionary upon visual inspection:</p>

<pre><code>options = parseOptions()
print options

{'debug': False, 'verbose': False}
</code></pre>

<p>When I try and update my <code>cfg</code> dict, I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>cfg.update(dict(options))
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""./myscript.py"", line 176, in &lt;module&gt;
    cfg.update(dict(options))
TypeError: iteration over non-sequence
</code></pre>

<p>The type of options is an instance of Values:</p>

<pre><code>print ""type(options)=%s instanceof=%s\n"" % (type(options), options.__class__.__name__)

type(options)=&lt;type 'instance'&gt; instanceof=Values
</code></pre>

<p>How can I update my <code>cfg</code> dictionary with the values in <code>options</code>?</p>

<p>We created two accounts for this purpose.  A spSearch to run the service and spCrawl to crawl the content DBs.  I setup the Foundation Search service with the spSearch account as the service account, the spCrawl account with pwd was added to the Content Access Acount.  The database was added (no specific instance required) and the database left at default settings. I updated the index timings and clicked ok.</p>

<p>I then clicked on the start link and clicked again on the start button.  I ensured the crawl account had access to the content database and added the server running search to the content database.</p>

When I click on the link, nothing happen. However, if i open the debugger, and refresh the onclick attribute, then it works fine afterward in IE. So it seems like IE, didn't ""see"" the onclick created by jQuery? Could that be possible?</p>

<p>Here is some sample code:</p>

<pre><code>var props;
props['views'] = [ 'item1', 'item2', 'item3' ];
</code></pre>

<p>saving the onclick from another  link and transfer it to the menu </p>

<pre><code>props['onclick'][i] = $(this).closest('a').attr('onclick');
</code></pre>

<p>then later on</p>

<pre><code>for (var i in props.views) {
    var a = $('&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;');        

    // override the class from props.linkclass
    var cssclass = 'myMenu';
    // override the onclick from props.onclick[i]
    var onclick = props.onclick[i] + ';highlightDynamicMenu(this);';
    a.attr( {
        'class' : cssclass,
        'href' : 'javascript:void(0);',
        'onclick' : onclick }
    );
    a.append(props.views[i]); // name of the link

    menu.append(a);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the  link that gets generated from my code, again, works perfectly fine everywhere else except IE8... ugh.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a onclick=""javascript:showMyDiv('div1208', 'div1208', event);highlightDynamicMenu(this);"" class=""myMenu"" href=""javascript:void(0);""&gt;item1&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, as I was mentioning before, if I open the debugger, and refresh the link, say removing  ""javascript:"" and hit enter, then IE8 would ""see"" the link...</p>

<p>What exactly is the issue here? >.&lt;</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I tried using: <code>a[0].setAttribute('onclick',onclick);</code> IE8 still won't pick it up...</p>

The automation add-in is activated in excel and registered at the system. basically the automation add-in running very well, when you call the function with</p>

<p><code>""=&lt;function-name&gt;(&lt;argument1&gt;;&lt;argument2&gt;;...;&lt;argument-n&gt;)""</code></p>

<p>by writing it into an excel cell or using the functionwizard.</p>

<p>The vsto add-in is used to initiate over a commandbarbutton a windows-form, where the user can type the arguments, which are required. If the user has finished a string will be written in the cell builded and looking like the example is wrote above.</p>

<p>the problem i´m fighting with is when the user starts excel, just using the windows-form to generate the string and clicking ""ok"" to fill the cell with it, excel tries to find the function cause of the ""="" in the cell, but dont find it.
In the cell finally stands <code>Name?</code>, because after looking in the functionwizard-list, my registered function disapeared.(Btw the add-in is still listed under ""extra->add-ins"" and is also loaded again after the next excelstart)</p>

<p>But on the other way if the user first use the functionwizard to get the value of the function, types it per hand in the cell or even just open the functionwizard and close it directly after opening without using the function, my windows-form generated string does work.</p>

<p>The onButtonClick-event performs the following example-code:</p>

<p><code>Me.Application.ActiveCell.Value = ""=FUNCTION(""""value1"""";""""value2"""")""</code></p>

<p>so now my question is, why is the automation function disapearing when the user just use the string-generator at first?</p>

<p>Some advices or even the solution the my problem would be very nice.</p>

<p>My idea for this application was to have all of these properties interact with one central point for fetching and saving data: an API. My various applications would then interact with this API, sending a <code>GET</code> request to fetch some data; a <code>POST</code> request to submit some data; <code>DELETE</code> requests and so on.</p>

<p>This API will be web-accessible, so I need a way to authenticate only white-listed applications. This API will never be available for third parties to interact with or build third-party applications with; it's to facilitate my applications only so I can cut out re-coding solutions across various platforms and focus only on the logic (controllers, essentially).</p>

<p>Therefore, would OAuth be suitable to be used as the authentication method for the above scenario?</p>

<p>My knowledge of OAuth isn't great, but if it is deemed a viable solution then I'll obviously read up on it before implementing. But as far as I know it works on tokens. A consumer (for example, my website) would request a token from the application (the API in this instance) and then the application would return a token to use in subsequent requests. Or something.</p>

<p>When a request comes in to my application, am I then able to accept/deny requests based on the requesting application? I.e. can I deny access to applications that aren't my own? How do I differentiate between applications? Do I retain a whitelist of IP address or URLs, and compare upon incoming requests?</p>

<p>Any help on the above would be most appreciated.</p>

<p>Our current Rails app is made out of sub-apps that are mounted as engines. Typically these engines are mounted on a subdomain in the main <code>routes.rb</code> file as follows</p>

<pre><code>mount MySubApp::Engine =&gt; '/', as: :sub_app, constraints: {subdomain: 'sub_app'}
</code></pre>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>Routes within <code>MySubApp</code>'s <code>routes.rb</code> file <strong>do not</strong> get the subdomain when using the named <code>_url</code> helpers. For example the following in <code>apps/my_sub_app/config/routes.rb</code></p>

<pre><code>MySubApp::Engine.routes.draw do
  resources :foos
end
</code></pre>

<p>gives us <code>sub_app.foo_url(5)</code> but it results in</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>http://<strong>www</strong>.example.com/foos/5</p>
</blockquote>

<p>when we want</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>http://<strong>sub_app</strong>.example.com/foos/5</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>tl;dr</h1>

<p>How can I get the engine's mounting constraints passed to its named routes?</p>

<h1>EDIT: A Workaround</h1>

<p>While I'd still prefer a better solution, the following will work. You can wrap all the routes in each of the sub apps <code>routes.rb</code> files that could be mounted on a subdomain like so</p>

<pre><code>MySubApp::Engine.routes.draw do
  constraints Rails.application.routes.named_routes[:sub_app].constraints do
    resources :foos
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h1>EDIT 2: A much less desirable workaround</h1>

<p>A commenter (since deleted?) pointed out you can pass a <code>subdomain</code> option to the helpers but we'd like to avoid having to use <code>sub_app.foo_url(5, {subdomain: 'sub_app'})</code> for every cross subdomain link. Even if we moved the subdomain name into an ENV var and made a wrapper, this is not DRY.</p>

"6331003","1","6335320","","2011-06-13 13:21:51","","2","1453","<p>I'm developing the client-server Winsock app (Visual C++) that should transmit the various kind of data (video stream, audio stream, service notifications, etc.) over the network. I know that the cleaner approach would be to use separate ports on separate threads for each individual data type (I call it ""stream"" here). But that would require occupying at least 5 different ports that would get problematic for some network infrastructures (firewall port forwarding, etc.).</p>

<p>So I'm trying to implement one-port connection (TCP), only one socket will be used to transmit different streams. The individual packets will have the info in header that will denote which stream it belongs to, total message size to be expected, etc. Say I have 5 different streams. I'm planning to use 5 threads to call <strong>send()</strong> of the same socket. Is this safe? I know the packets from different streams will arrive mixed but if I include necessary meta information in each sent packet, it could be reconstructed properly on the other side, right?</p>

<p>But the real problem is the receiving end. While it's probably OK to call <strong>send()</strong> from multiple threads on the same socket (though I'm not sure and need your confirmation!), calling <strong>recv()</strong> from multiple threads would not make much sense. So I should use one blocking <strong>recv()</strong> from one thread. But then, based on the packet header (identifying which stream the particular packet belongs to) I should fork the processing in different threads. Video stream should be processed by one thread, sound stream - by another, etc. But I don't quite know how to do this - how to fork the data processing from the receiving thread. Performance is a top priority so processing all streams by one thread can't be considered.</p>

<p>So to sum it up, I have three questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it OK to call <strong>send()</strong> for same socket from multiple threads? (assuming there will be info in packet header about which sender thread (i.e. subsystem) it belongs).</li>
<li>Having one <strong>blocking</strong> socket on the receiving end, calling <strong>recv()</strong> in loop from a single thread, how to ""fork"" the received packets of different logical streams to different worker threads?</li>
<li>What would be your additional recommendations for implementing multiple-stream transfer through one port?</li>
</ul>

<p>P.S.: Afaik, there's no way to use one port by multiple sockets, correct?</p>

<p>It's Windows platform, Winsock2, Visual C++ (if you could provide platform-specific hints that would be awesome).</p>

<p><strong>= UPDATE =</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>When you say to ""lock socket"", you mean serialize the access to <strong>send()</strong> function? e.g. with <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686908%28v=VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Critical Section</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>As for receiving end... I think I'll assemble messages (I call ""message"" the logical complete data structure, e.g. video frame, or sound sample, etc.) when <strong>recv()</strong>-ing them in loop (buffering messages from individual streams into individual buffers), and then I just pass the assembled messages (when one will be fully received), to forking threads. <strong><em>Now that is the question - how to pass them.</em></strong> The one way I've thought of is <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682655%28v=VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Event Objects</a>: <strong>SetEvent()</strong> from receiver thread to trigger <strong>WaitForSingleObject()</strong> (which is in some loop) in different threads. Can you advice if this is the acceptable solution? Can you suggest anything better? Aren't there any faster solutions to do this (""trigger"" another thread of the same application) than Event Objects? And how to pass the data?</p></li>

<p>I have two divs say #left and #right.  #right has fixed dimensions 150px x 50px.  I want #left to expand and fill the remaining space and #right to be on the very right of the screen.  I have tried floating them in different ways and also setting display: inline-block; but i still cant seem to nail it.  All the articles i've read are about the left div being fixed and the right one growing.  I tried reversing what i read but it always leads to the #left div floating around #right. What i mean by this is, my #left div will with shrink to its smallest (inline-block) or it will display the first 50px up to the #right then the rest of #left will tuck under #right rather than staying flush.</p>

<p>I hope this makes sense. It's kind of hard to explain.

<p><strong>Details:</strong> I have my project files added to the new Eclipse BlackBerry Project and added the Phonegap lib to the build paths, however I cannot seem to figure out how to connect the MyApp.java to the index.html to run the project as a phonegap/web app.</p>

<p><strong>Setup:</strong> I believe I have all of the pre-reqs taken care of: Java JDK/JRE, Eclipse, BlackBerry WebWorks SDK, BB WW SDK plug-in and JRE's for Eclipse, phonegap libs &amp; files, and my project files. I have created a new BlackBerry project and added my files to it and configured the build path.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> I have developed several apps for iOS and Android already and a client has asked me to develop one for BlackBerry (using phonegap/callback). I've used phonegap with Eclipse for Android without any problems, but I am having a heck of a time getting it setup properly for BlackBerry.</p>

<p><strong>Research:</strong> I have spent the past 2 days looking all over stackoverflow, phonegap wiki, blackberry forums, and everywhere google could take me and I cannot find anything relevant or helpful. It seems BlackBerry has recently changed their development tools and/or SDK and plugins. Most of the tutorials that would seem helpful refer to a BlackBerry Eclipse plug-in that is no longer available (which would allow one to create ""BlackBerry Widget"" projects). I have found numerous links to pages on BlackBerry's website that others site and/or refer to but only result in 404's. I've about had it with BlackBerry!</p>

<p><strong>Thanks in advance for any help you may offer.</strong></p>

<p>In a user control (.ascx), I have a certain radio button list with two Radio buttons with values ""On"" and ""Off"", that when clicked I'd like it to set the selected radio button for some other radio buttons that also have the same ""On"" and ""Off"". </p>

<p>When the controlling radio button list is set to ""On"", i'd like to check the ""Off"" radio in those dependent radio buttons.  And when it is set to ""Off"", switch those dependent ones back to ""On"".</p>

<p>Additionally I have some checkboxes that need to respond to the same controlling ""On""/""Off"" as well.  They should become unchecked when it is ""On"" and checked when it is ""Off"".</p>

<h2>What I have now</h2>

<p>Below is what I have.  <strong>It is working just fine in Chrome and Firefox, but not IE 11</strong></p>

<p>In Page_Load() I have:</p>

<pre><code> Me.rblController.Items(0).Attributes.Add(""OnClick"", ""ToggleOtherStuff();"")
 Me.rblController.Items(1).Attributes.Add(""OnClick"", ""ToggleOtherStuff();"")
</code></pre>

<p>Each radio button list to respond the controller rbl looks like this, they have class ""customerRadioButtonList"": </p>

<pre><code>   &lt;asp:RadioButtonList ID=""rblCustomer1"" CssClass=""customerRadioButtonList"" runat=""server"" RepeatDirection=""Horizontal""&gt;
                &lt;asp:ListItem&gt;On&lt;/asp:ListItem&gt;
                &lt;asp:ListItem&gt;Off&lt;/asp:ListItem&gt;
            &lt;/asp:RadioButtonList&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The checkboxes are simple as well, they have class ""AlertsCheckBox"":</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:CheckBox ID=""cbxAlertCheck1"" CssClass=""AlertsCheckBox"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the function that runs in response to the clicks of the controller radios:</p>

<pre><code>function ToggleOtherStuff() {        

    if ($telerik.$('#&lt;%=rblController.ClientID%&gt; input[type=""radio""][value=""On""]').first().is(':checked')) {          

        alert('On Clicked'); // This fires OK in IE too

        $telerik.$('.customerRadioButtonList input[type=""radio""][value=""Off""]').prop('checked', true);                      

        $telerik.$('AlertsCheckBox input').prop('checked', false);

    } else {

        $telerik.$('.customerRadioButtonList input[type=""radio""][value=""On""]').each(function () {
            if (this.disabled == false) {
                this.checked = true;
            }

        });

        $telerik.$('AlertsCheckBox input').each(function () {
            if (this.disabled == false) {
                this.checked = true;
            }
        });
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm completely stumped why this is not working in IE.  I thought maybe the Telerik Ajax is to blame, I removed the AjaxManagerProxy in the .aspx of the page that uses this control, but that had no affect. The events are firing fine as I can see because of some debug alerts(); I put in.  </p>

<p>I also verified that the Jquery selectors I'm using do return values, and I can even read the 'checked' property values.  <strong>But I can't set the 'checked' property</strong>.  Setting it is having no effect, all radio buttons and checkboxes are not changing.  What's going on?</p>

<p>I am currently using JAXB 2 to generate code from an XSD on which I have no control.  I need to access the constraints from the schemas so I can apply some logic and guard code when setting values in these objects.  Validation in bulk simply will not do.  In most cases I can simply truncate the string and all will be good.  For this I need to get the length that was declared in the XSD in order to apply it in the guard code and keep this layer generic.  The alternative is to copy and hard code the lengths but frankly if there was a better way to do this I would really appreciate.</p>

<p>I speak of string length here but this applies to all facets declarable in an XSD.</p>

<p>Suggestions, Code samples and links welcome, basically anything that would help me NOT hard code the data in the classes.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>My problem is that whenever i click page 2,3,4... the display doesn't change. Page 2,3,4 gets the display of page 1. It should be like this. For example, page 1 should display ID = 1 and case status = open. Page 2 should display ID = 2 and case status = close and so on.     </p>

</code></pre>

<p>As, i wanted to get it from php file. To achieve it I made a ajax call </p>

<pre><code>    var my = {
    src : 'http://192.168.1.58/annotate/drive/image/&lt;?php echo $_GET['file']?&gt;',
    text : 'Suresh and Gopinath....',

    }]
}
console.log(my);
console.log('__________');
    $.post(""masterCall/selectAnnotation.php"",
        { url: 'http://192.168.1.58/annotate/drive/image/&lt;?php echo $_GET['file']?&gt;'

        function(data,status){
        console.log(data);
        console.log('__________');
        //anno.addAnnotation(data);
        });
</code></pre>

<p>While doing this, I can see the difference in console.. </p>

<p>Here is the screen of what happens i do console log of <code>console.log(my)</code> and <code>console.log(data)</code> </p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xko3I.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xko3I.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So, how can i make the proper response which appears like inside the <code>console.log(my)</code></p>

<p><strong>Note :</strong></p>

<p>The <code>var my</code> is the proper format that i need, I wanted to get the same format posted from php file and get it in jquery.</p>

<p><strong>Update :</strong> </p>

<p>When i try to do </p>

<pre><code>$v = ""{
    src : 'http://192.168.1.58/annotate/drive/image/test.jpg',

    }]
}"";
echo json_encode($v);
</code></pre>

<p>and in jquery </p>

<pre><code>function(data,status){
        var obj = jQuery.parseJSON( data);
        console.log(obj);
        });

But on the documentation I haven't found how the event number with the mask field is combined to give the NNN value. Only one example in <code>perf help</code> shows a value A8 and a mask of 01 resulting in 1a8. But what is the general rule when masking? Shouldn't it be written in the documentation or it is a standard OR function or something?</p>

<p>Also I haven't understood from the documentation or from other relevant topics' replies, whether LLC values measured in Xeon case are for L3 or L2. What happens when there is third level of cache in the hardware? Does the LLC still measure last level i.e. L3 events?</p>

<p>As you can see the tab Divs are wrapped in a form (post to Controller X).</p>

<p>The problem is the partial view for the file upload also includes a form which should post to a handler. But when I initiate a file upload in Tab 3 it is attempting to post to Controller X of the original form. </p>

<p>How can I structure my view to have the fields included in the form on tabs 1 &amp; 2 post to Controller X and the Form in Tab 3 post to its correct handler?</p>

<p>The bottom line is I am trying to post separately to 2 different forms included in different tab panels </p>

So far, I have made a tiled map using tiles that are 32x32, placed the player character &amp; several NPC's into the world. Even made the NPC's randomly move around the map, though the way it teaches in the book is having them move from tile to tile (any of the 8 tiles surrounding the NPC at any time - if a tile has some property such as categoryBitMask then it won't move to that tile).</p>

<p>I am going to change NPC movement to physics-based (which is its own problem) just like the player character has right now (which means NPC's will collide with objects that have a physicsBody like the player character does). It's more fluid &amp; dynamic.</p>

<p>But here is where the question begins. I want to implement Pathfinding (such as the A* algorithm) into the NPC &amp; player character movement due to the map containing buildings, water, trees, etc. with their own physicsBodies. It's one thing to limit NPC's random movement or to force them to walk a predetermined path (which will kill the point of this game), but it's another to have to tap the screen very often to have the player character avoid all the buildings/trees he has to walk past. I don't want to use a grid system. Is it possible to implement some pathfinding algorithm into x,y coordinates? Is this more resource intensive? Could you share your thoughts about this?</p>

<p>The test cash flow I am using to calculate the IRR is the following:
""Print tempCashFlow: (
    ""-5099701.25"",
    ""-22503.796875"",
    ""-22503.79296875"",

    ""11110408.45703125""
)</p>

<p>The above temporary cash flow contains quarterly figures over a 5-year period (i.e. 20 periods plus the time zero period... so 21 figures in the cash flow).</p>

<p>The code delivers 15.2% IRR instead of circa 16.0% produced by Excel IRR function.  I also tested it manually, and I believe 16% is the correct answer.  Can anyone help understand what may be wrong with the code?  I cannot see any issues.  It also appears to be identical to code promoted on this link as well: </p>

<p>PS: I've also noticed that the margin of error increases dramatically if I reduce the cash flow to a 2-year period instead of a 5-year period (e.g. something like 35% (incorrect) versus 45% IRR (correct answer)</p>

<p>A little background: The utility is the Inline::CPP language extension for Perl.  The extension automatically includes <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code>, and tries to make a good guess whether a '.h' is required or not (and of course whether or not the compiler supports namespaces).  But it's far from perfect in that regard, and this issue is diminishing the breadth of the utility's usefulness.</p>

<p>So to reiterate the question: How do I portably detect whether a compiler supports standard headers such as <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code>, or pre-standard headers such as <code>&lt;iostream.h&gt;</code>?</p>

<p><em>UPDATED</em> (thanks bill!)</p>

<p>Alright! Go it working.  I just had to make a couple of changes from bill's suggestion.  Mainly using ArrayCollection with ObjectProxy so it was both bindable and dynamic.  One weird thing - I couldn't select a button in the first row if I filled in the array at construction time; I had to delay that until the creationComplete event was fired (which is fine, since I'm going to populate the grid from a db anyway).</p>

<p>So basically my issue with the above is as follows;</p>

<p>If I try to enter the path:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Users\Public\Pictures\Sample Pictures
</code></pre>

<p><strong>I get the error:</strong></p>

<pre><code>ERROR: Invalid Parameter #3 : ""Backups\2013/10/22""
Source: C:\Users\Public\Pictures\Sample\
Destination: G:\Pictures
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how the destination in the first line of the error has forward slashes instead of backslashes? But what I find break it is the space between ""Sample"" and ""Pictures"".</p>

<p>For if I use a single word, it works perfectly, but brings me to my second problem;</p>

<pre><code>Source: C:\Users\User\Pictures\BlackBerry\
Destination: G:\Backups\2013\10\22\
</code></pre>

<p>The source is correct, however in the destination folder it doesn't recreate the ""Blackberry"" folder, only the contents therein, and that is my issue...</p>

<p>For the user gets to choose multiple destinations to XCOPY, yet all that will happen is all the files get bunched together, with no folder structure etc...</p>

<p>My head is blown with trying to figure this all out, so I am REALLY hoping so kind soul will be able to help me out with this! :)</p>

Some of these toolbar buttons are universal to the application; some pertain to individual tabs.</p>

<p>My instinct is to create a base view controller class with all universal toolbar construction and implementation code, then have each of my root view controllers inherit from this base class.  If they want to add additional buttons to the toolbar, they simply need to override the toolbar construction method (where I'll centralize the construction of the tool bar), and add the implementation code for the additional buttons.</p>

<p>When the project is being built in CruiseControl.net, one can see the progress on a web dashboard - a log snippet is displayed showing what's going on right now. </p>

<p>However, sometimes the log snippet gets collapsed and doesn't show anything, although it's obvious a certain long action takes place. It just says <strong><em>Building...</em></strong></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YeYx0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Why is that happening and how to resolve it to always show current action? Is the problem in the action itself or the general configuration of CC.NET/webdashboard?</p>

<p><code>int(x* exp (v*x + (1-exp(v*x))/v),x, o , inf)</code> does not work.</p>

<p>Note that I will have values for <code>v</code>.</p>

<pre><code>%n=10;
kappa=.5;
delta0=.5;
Vmax=500;
Vdep=2.2;
l=2.2;
kbT=4.1;
%xb=.4;
fb=10;
k=1;
V0=5;

e1=(fb*l/kbT)*(kappa/delta0);
e2=Vmax/V0;
e3=Vdep/V0;

w=zeros(1,25);

for v=1:25
    w(:,v)=integral(@(x) x.*exp(v*x+((1-exp(v*x))/v)),0,inf);
end

e12=e2*exp(-e1*(1:25).*w.^2)-e3;
plot(e12);
ylim([0 25]);
hold on;
plot(0:25,0:25);
xlim([0 25]);
%hold off;
</code></pre>

<p>The plot is not matching the real data in the article!(for the e12 curve specially)
I need to calculate the intersection of the 2 curves (which is ~13.8 based on the paper) and then in the second part I have to add a term in e12 which contains an independent variable:</p>

<pre><code>v=13.8;
w= integral(@(x) x.*exp(v*x+((1-exp(v*x))/v)),0,inf)
e4 = zeros (1,180);
fl = 1:180;
e4(:,fl)= (fl*l/kbT)*(kappa/n);
e12=e2*exp(-e1*v*w^2-e4)-e3
</code></pre>

<p>But again the problem is that running this code I will end with a negative value for e12 which  should be just approaching zero in large values of fl (fl>160)</p>

<p>to show how this code is different from the expected curve you can plot these data on the same figure:</p>

<pre><code>fl = [0, 1, 4, 9, 15, 20, 25, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180];
e12 = [66, 60, 50, 40, 30, 25.5, 20, 15.5, 10.5, 8.3, 6.6, 5, 2.25, 1.1, 0.5];
</code></pre>

<p>which obviously does not match the curve generated by the code.</p>

I have seen other posts answering this question, however I am extending ActionBarActivity so I can not simply solve this problem by using something like EditText f1 = (EditText) <strong>getActivity()</strong>.findViewById(R.id.field1);</p>

    }

<p>I know I am getting the NullPointerException because I am not accessing the right view that contains this editText. I have a method that is called when a button is clicked and it works fine.</p>

    SharedPreferences.Editor edit2 = pref2.edit();

    edit1.putString(""textField1"", f1.getText().toString());
    edit2.putString(""textField2"", f2.getText().toString());

+------------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
</code></pre>

<p>The main problem with this is that the <code>BinaryData</code> Java class loads the <code>BINARY_DATA</code> column, even if I only require the <code>BINARY_DATA_NAME</code>. I know that the best way to architect this is to split the data from the meta-data (like the file name) so they live in separate tables. From there it's trivial to make the data lazy-loaded. This is how it should have been done in the first place.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it may not be possible for me to do the above due to organizational constraints. As a workaround, is it possible to make that column lazy-loaded using some annotations instead of splitting things out into separate tables? I've modified the <code>BinaryData</code> class so that it has an inner static <code>BinaryDataData</code> class which is <code>@Embedded</code> and the attribute is <code>@Basic(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)</code>:</p>

<p>Anyone had this experience before? (I tested in chrome/firefox both had same behaviour)</p>

<p>Am happy to post code but the JSONLoader(ed) model is massive.</p>

<p>What is the best way to do a running update of the master dataframe with this returned set of data? So far I've come up with:</p>

<pre><code>df = df.append(df_trial, ignore_index=True)

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>df = pd.concat([df, df_trial])

<p>So I am trying to update the navigation on a site that I inherited only to find out that the previous programmer was a college student and was using this site as a project of some sort.  Needless to say there are zero comments and the code calls function after function and I just can't follow the logic.</p>

<p>I am looking for a roundabout way to update the navigation. I tried using Dreamweaver to search through all of the files in the site and look for any files that contain the name of the page or the url (hoping to find some sort of included file). There was none. I did file text files that control the main navigation but none for the subnavigation.</p>

<p>There is no database.</p>

<p>If it helps here is the site. <a href=""http://bit.ly/jbs639"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/jbs639</a></p>

<p>And if you want to look at the interesting text file that is parsed to create the main navigation you can find it here: <a href=""http://bit.ly/m3erna"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/m3erna</a></p>

<li><p>Creating a class <code>Road</code> that stores data like: List of Long- and Latitude coordinates and connected roads (e.g. A coordinate + the id of another <code>Road</code> that is connected on this coordinate).</p></li>
<li><p>Drawing the roads with Polyline from the Long- and Latitude coordinates stored in road objects</p></li>
<li><p>How the algorithm to iterate through the roads should look like, to prevent endless loops of attempts to find the ""best"" road direction. (Any suggestions or references?)</p></li>
<li><p>A better way to track current location than Geolocation (I have yet to test it on a Phone device, but it was very inaccurate when tested on my laptop here at home)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As to the four points above, I am unsure if this is the right way to go on about this system. </p>

<p>I would really appreciate some input on the <code>Road</code> class that i mean to create. It is the only way i could think of that ""might"" work, when trying to iterate through the roads to find a suggested direction from <code>Point A</code> to <code>Point B</code>.

<p>The axFlash_FlashCal is called fine, as long as there is a textbox on screen that's set to use TLF text. (any textbox will do, no specific ID). Without the textbox the even will not fire. (Even though ExternalInterface.Avaliable is set to true)</p>

<p>I've tried using CS4 and CS5 to publish, using both Flash 10 and 9 as output. None of these things have made a difference.</p>

<p>I'm using AS3 and .NET 4.0. Has anyone run into this before, or has any idea why TLF text is needed for this to work?</p>

When a HTML page contains a lot of small images it will take some time to have it completely rendered, especially since each file needs to be requested separately. For example, if you have 500 32x32 avatar images which you want to display, then the browser needs to do 500 requests with 500 headers resulting in 500 responses also with headers. Thus, a lot of traffic.<br />
To reduce the amount of traffic, I would think it would be better to send all files as a single request/response and have some client script do the splitting of this file into separate images, to be placed wherever needed. Thus, the browser executes a script, the script requests for the image package, the server returns the package and then the script would put those images in it's proper locations. Thus, one request/response instead of 500 requests/responses.<br />Has something similar been created already? If so, by whom?</p>

"18254348","1","","","2013-08-15 14:01:32","","1","89","<p>I have a rather generic question, I apologize it's lengthy. It's not just MySQL related and can be done in any scripting language but I did not find a better way to explain it. I have a list of unique words. Right now they are in a table in MySQL but implementation does not really matter, they can be in a text file just as well. Each word is exactly 6 chars. Words follow several sligtly different formats. My goal is to shorten each word from 6 to 4 chars preserving uniquness.</p>

<p>I googled the subject and all things like data minimization/optimization/collision did not provide useful results :( so here I am.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>--------------
words
--------------
word     short
------   ----
1A0001
1A0002
1A0003
AA0001
AA1001
AB0001
2BAC11
2BAC34
--------------
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see there are three formats that can be represented by the following generalized regular expressions:</p>

<pre><code>^[0-9][A-Z][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]$  - matches  1A0001 1A0002 1A0003
^[A-Z][A-Z][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]$  - matches  AA0001 AA1001 AB0001
^[0-9][A-Z][A-Z][A-Z][0-9][0-9]$  - matches  2BAC11 2BAC34
</code></pre>

<p>So based on the format different chars can be dropped to make the words 4 chars long and keep them unique.</p>

<pre><code>^[0-9][A-Z][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]$  - drop 1, 3
^[A-Z][A-Z][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]$  - drop 3, 4
^[0-9][A-Z][A-Z][A-Z][0-9][0-9]$  - drop 1, 4
</code></pre>

<p>I create values for <code>short</code> using <code>regexp/concat/substring</code> and a temporary table to do an update to <code>words</code>. As I said implementation is not really important for the explanation. It pretty much boils down to this:</p>

<pre><code>select concat(substring(word,2,1), substring(word,4,3)) from words where word regexp '^[0-9][A-Z][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]$';
select concat(substring(word,1,3), substring(word,6,1)) from words where word regexp '^[A-Z][A-Z][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]$';
select concat(substring(word,2,2), substring(word,5,2)) from words where word regexp '^[0-9][A-Z][A-Z][A-Z][0-9][0-9]$';
</code></pre>

<p>This is how the table would look like in the end:</p>

<pre><code>--------------
words
--------------
word     short
------   ----
1A0001   A001
1A0002   A002
1A0003   A003
AA0001   AA01
AA1001   AA11
AB0001   AB01
2BAC11   BA11
2BAC34   BA34
--------------
</code></pre>

<p>I can verify the uniqueness of <code>short</code> using:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; select short from words group by short having count(short) &gt; 1;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is very simplified scenario. In reality words are longer and there are more formats. Sometimes even though format is the same dropping same chars would create collisions, meaning two different <code>word</code> would result in a same <code>short</code> which is not acceptable. So <code>short</code> needs to be modified to become unique. The biggest difficulty comes from the fact that all the <code>word</code> are actually human understandable so <code>short</code> version should be human understandable as well and resemble the original <code>word</code>. This means I can't create some sort of hashing algorithm to ensure uniqueness of the short version, that's not enough, it has to be somewhat like the original word. Right now I'm thinking of replacing <code>0</code> with <code>O</code> and so on.</p>

<p>I guess you got a feel that this is more of a science question rather than an implementation question. The only important aspect of the implementation is performance. I'd like to have a good performance so I don't have to wait forever.</p>

<p>Have anybody seen anything similar?</p>

<p>Where would I start looking for a way to do it?</p>

<p>I'm making a mortal kombat clone with jQuery. I have basic things hardwired right now, like moving, jumping and punch and kick with a and s. They will all be passed through a timer like with a normal game, the hardwiring is just temporary. </p>

<p>I am putting characters in a ""hitbox"" div. The character is represented by an image. This image is an animated gif for walking and for standing, and images for kicks and punches.</p>

<p>For some reason, the gif pauses while the character is walking via .css('left' +/- =15px). It plays once, then stops. It has nothing to do with walking per se, just that the div is moving. </p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I noticed that when dragging windows, the lag would occur only if the dragging is done on top of the Docking Panel portion of the screen. Furthermore, dragging a window from the portion where the Docking Panel is located to where the Tree View is located will also cause some lag. The lag only disapears if the dragging is initiated where the Tree View is, and doesn't leave its boundaries.</p>

<p>Knowing this, I tried to look for the OnPaint events of the Docking Panel, fearing that there might be constants redraws with heavy processing. This wasn't the case.</p>

<p>Removing the OnPaint methods (just for testing) still resulted in lag when dragging windows.</p>

<p>Removing the background image bellow the docking panel also resulted in no performance gain.</p>

<p>I feel that I looked everywhere, but I have yet to understand or imagine what could be causing such redraws.</p>

<p>Anyone has any advice to give me... ? Did anyone here have to deal with such a problem in the past... ?</p>

<p>What would you suggest that I look for ?</p>

<p>Thanks and have a great day.</p>

So I have a context-menu declared as a static resource, and that resource is being used as one of the Setter Properties for the ListBoxItem style:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;ContextMenu x:Key=""ClearFilt""&gt;
        &lt;MenuItem Header=""Remove Item from Filter View"" Command=""{Binding}"" CommandParameter=""{Binding vfm_string}""/&gt;
        &lt;MenuItem Header=""Clear Filter"" Command=""{Binding}"" CommandParameter=""Clear""/&gt;
    &lt;/ContextMenu&gt;

    &lt;Style TargetType=""{x:Type ListBoxItem}""&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""ContextMenu"" Value=""{ StaticResource ClearFilt}""/&gt;

<p>With this code, the menu appears just fine when I right click the ListBoxItem:</p>

<p>However, clicking on each menu item (""Remove Item from Filter View"" and ""Clear Filter"") does not call the corresponding Execute function.  How can I get the Setter Property to keep the data context? i.e. why isn't it triggering the underlying Command object when I click on the menu items?</p>

<p><strong>document</strong></p>

<pre><code>{
    ""title"": ""Any article"",
    ""sectionName"": [
        {
            ""title"": ""lorem ipsum 1"",
            ""type"": ""element"",
            ""order"": 1
        },
        {
            ""title"": ""lorem ipsum 2"",
            ""type"": ""element"",
            ""order"": 2
        },
        {
            ""title"": ""lorem ipsum 3"",
            ""type"": ""element"",
            ""order"": 3
        },
        {
            ""title"": ""lorem ipsum 4"",
            ""type"": ""element"",
            ""order"": 4
        }
    ],
}
</code></pre>

<p>A user can select (in a list) some of the elements. With a button-click a new element will be added and the selected elements are moved to group-array.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul data-section=""sectionName""&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;input type=""checkbox"" value=""1""&gt; &lt;input type=""text"" value=""lorem ipsum 1""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;input type=""checkbox"" value=""2""&gt; &lt;input type=""text"" value=""lorem ipsum 2""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;input type=""checkbox"" value=""3""&gt; &lt;input type=""text"" value=""lorem ipsum 3""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;input type=""checkbox"" value=""4""&gt; &lt;input type=""text"" value=""lorem ipsum 4""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The values of the checkboxes are set by spacebars in the template. Now assume the user selected element 2 and 3. These should move to a new group, so that this document results:</p>

<p><strong>what is needed...</strong></p>

<pre><code>{
    ""title"": ""Any article"",
    ""sectionName"": [
        {
            ""title"": ""lorem ipsum 1"",
            ""type"": ""element"",
            ""order"": 1
        },
        {
            ""title"": ""lorem ipsum 4"",
            ""type"": ""element"",
            ""order"": 3
        },
        {
            ""title"": ""new group"", // &lt;-- new
            ""type"": ""group"", // &lt;-- new
            ""order"": 2, // &lt;-- order id of first selected element
            ""groupElements"": [ // &lt;-- add new group-array
                {
                    ""title"": ""lorem ipsum 2"",
                    ""type"": ""element"",
                    ""order"": 1 // &lt;-- new order
                },
                {
                    ""title"": ""lorem ipsum 3"",
                    ""type"": ""element"",
                    ""order"": 4 // &lt;-- new order
                }
            ]
        }, 
    ],
}
</code></pre>

<p>That means a new group-element will be added with the orderId of the first selected element and to this new group-element the selected elements are moved.</p>

<p>Now I have some problems with the update procedure:</p>

<pre><code>var inputFields = wrapper.getElementsByTagName('input');
var selectedElements = new Array();

for(var i = 0; i &lt; inputFields.length; i++) {
    if (inputFields[i].type == 'checkbox' &amp;&amp; inputFields[i].checked == true) {
        if (!firstElementOrderNumber) firstElementOrderNumber = parseInt(inputFields[i].parentNode.parentNode.getAttribute('data-order'));
        selectedElements.push(inputFields[i].value);                
    }
} 
</code></pre>

<p>So first I have to push the new element:</p>

<pre><code>var newSectionTitle = ""new group"";
var selectedElementsObj = // how to create the object from 'selectedElements'?
Articles.update({ _id: id, ...query? }, { $push: { title: newSectionTitle, groupElements: selectedElementsObj } }; 
</code></pre>

<p>And now I have to remove the selected Elements. </p>

<p><strong>My problems</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>How do I do the correct query as I want to select the _id of the doc, the <code>sectionName</code> (=data-section) to do the update in this nested array?</li>
<li>How do I create the <code>selectedElementObj</code> which I want to insert in the groupElements-array?</li>
<li>How do I remove the selected elements?</li>
</ol>

The SDK has been tested on a pure-Android project and is working fine. I am using FREContext.dispatchStatusEventAsync to return information about each beacon that is detected. However, in watching the logs returning from LogCat while the AIR app is running, I'm seeing an IllegalArgumentException being thrown each time a beacon is found. Interestingly, I am able to use dispatchStatusEventAsync anywhere else and it seems to be working fine. </p>

<p>Here is all of the pertinent code for the ANE. (I've masked the name of the SDK by doing a find/replace but the code compiles so please do not consider it a possible issue if there is something crazy with the naming of a class or function).</p>

(It's a 5-year degree in my university so I can pursue the same project for two consecutive years if I want to). Our knowledge in AI is very basic at this moment since we'll be specializing in it these coming two years, so a very advanced idea will probably be hard to accomplish. We're not expected to research new untouched soils either, so the more resources the better.</p>

<p>I'm interested in ideas that can benefit people and not just applying algorithms and techniques. I want to do a masters after graduation, but I'm not sure in what field yet. 
I'd love to do a medical application or a project that of some use to the handicapped.
Some projects that were already pursued at the university included a project to recognize breast cancer, and to teach sign language to the deaf. </p>

<p>I'm wondering:</p>

<p>1) what other ideas we can work on in those fields? </p>

<p>2) how much will my choice of graduation project affect my application for a masters degree?</p>

<p>3) Is a stocks price prediction expert system too advanced for us?</p>

<p>becomes the output of the async task json call.</p>

<p>so basically all i want to do is on calling this php file from the app, it should compute the closest user and the return the latitude and longitude value of the closest user to the application.maybe by either updating the same php file variable or updating another php file variable like the above case
i know this may not be the correct way to do this, so any help would be gud.</p>

<p>The goal of this test app is to show the scene from a few separate angles so that I can see how the intersection line looks based on my code. I wanted to draw the line starting at the camera's origin and ending at the intersection point, but it's acting oddly. The endpoint seems to be being pushed farther along the x axis in the positive direction than it should be, and in some spots it's seems to sort of...skip, as if there were a hole at that location or something. Although I still remember a bit of linear algebra from calculus, I don't remember enough to know exactly what I'm doing here and I've scoured through many of the resources online with no luck. I'm hoping someone that reads this will have more experience dealing with this than I and will be kind enough to help me, or give me any tips if there's something else that I may be doing the wrong or in an inefficient way.</p>

<p>So for a class which has the form</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T, template &lt;typename T&gt; class MyFunctor&gt;
class MyMainClass
{
    MyFunctor&lt;T&gt; myInstance;
public:
    setConfigOfMyFunctor&lt;ConfigClass&gt;(const ConfigClass&amp; cfg); //problem is here. How can I write this?
}
</code></pre>

<p>I define FunctorClass which I will use as the second template parameter in MyMainClass</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
class FunctorClass
{
public:
    ConfigClass&lt;T&gt; cfg;
    int a;
    int b;
    int c;
}
</code></pre>

<p>where my config class is simply</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;Typename T&gt;
class ConfigClass
{
    T cfgval1;
    T cfgval2;
public:
    void setVals(int cfgVal1, ...);
    //.....
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I make an object of this class</p>

<pre><code>int main()
{
    typedef double T;
    MyMainClass&lt;T,FunctorClass&gt; classy;
    ConfigClass&lt;T&gt; config;
    config.setVals(1, 2, ...);
    //so I'm looking for something like the following line (taken from first declaration)
    classy.setConfigOfMyFunctor&lt;ConfigClass&gt;(config); //this is supposed to copy the object config to the FunctorClass's object in MyMainClass.
}
</code></pre>

<p>So in brief, I want the object <code>config</code> to be copied to MyMainClass&lt;>::FunctorClass&lt;>::cfg</p>

<p>Is that possible?</p>

<p>If you need more information on the problem, please let me know.</p>

<p>Thank you for any efforts.</p>

This relies on scrollViewDidScroll: delegate call, which gives me actual contentOffset, and here I decide when to reuse particular subview. So far so good.</p>

<p>Sometimes I need to change contentOffset programatically, but with custom animation (inertia and bounce back to the final position). I can do this quite easily using core animation.</p>

<p><strong>The problem is, that during custom animation scrollViewDidScroll: delegate method is not called -> I must do it manually so that subviews reusing works.</strong> I tried to call it with timer firing each 0.02 sec. Now there are two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I must get UIScrollView contentOffset using [[_scrollView.layer presentationLayer] bounds].origin.x because during animation normal _scrollView.contentOffset does not change.</p>

<p><em>However info from presentationLayer is not sufficient for exact syncing - sometimes it is bit late.</em></p></li>
<li><p>problem is when the new contentOffset is far from current position. It looks like built-in UIScrollView animation is CAKeyframeAnimation, and scrollViewDidScroll should is called on key frames positions. But I am not able to get these. </p>

<p><em>If I rely on timer which is <strong>not</strong> synced with key frames, views are reused on wrong places and I can not see them at all during animation.</em></p></li>

<p>However, when it comes to numbers close to 2^64 there's only the ten primes mentioned on the page <a href=""https://primes.utm.edu/lists/2small/0bit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Primes just less than a power of two</a> at primes.utm.edu and that seems to be it.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://primes.utm.edu/curios/includes/primetest.php"" rel=""nofollow"">primality test</a> found there refuses to work on numbers that don't fit a double, others - elsewhere - fail to refuse and just print trash. The primesieve.org program refuses to work with numbers that aren't at least some 40 billion below 2^64, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence in the quality of their coding. The same result everywhere: nada, zilch, niente.</p>

<p>The cogs and gears of sieves start creaking around the 2^62 mark, and close to 2^64 there's hardly a cog that doesn't creak loudly threatening to break apart. Hence the need for testing the implementation is greatest where verification is most difficult, because of the scarcity/absence of reliable reference data. The primesieve.org program seems to be the only one that works at least up to 2^63 or thereabouts, but I don't trust it too much because of the above-mentioned issue.</p>

<p>So how then can one verify the proper operation of a sieve close to 2^64? Are there reliable lists somewhere for a million (or ten million or a hundred million) primes just below and above powers of two like 2^64, 2^63 and so on? Or are there reliable (trustworthy, verified, banged-on a lot) programs that yield such sequences or that can verify primes or lists of primes?</p>

<p>Once a sieve has been verified it can be used to produce handy lists with <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26606355/checksumming-large-swathes-of-prime-numbers-for-verification"">sums/checksums</a> for loads of interesting ranges, but absent such lists the situation seems difficult...</p>

<p>P.S.: I determined the upper limit for the <a href=""http://primesieve.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">primesieve.org turbo siever</a> to be <code>UINT64_MAX - 10 * UINT32_MAX</code>, or 0xFFFFFFF600000009.

Here's my setup:</p>

<pre><code>var path = require('path');

module.exports = function(grunt) {

    grunt.event.on('watch', function(action, filepath, target) {
        if(target!=='upload') return;

    });

    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');

};
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>rsync</code> task works great on its own; it uploads my entire project relatively quickly but not quite fast enough to run on every file edit.</p>

<p>I'm trying to use <code>grunt.event.on</code> to modify the <code>src</code> just before running the task again so that it uploads just the one file. <code>grunt.task.run('rsync:dev')</code> doesn't seem to do anything at all, however. Doesn't error, nothing. Here's the output when I run it and then create a new file:</p>

<pre><code>$ grunt watch:upload --debug --stack
Running ""watch:upload"" (watch) task
Waiting...OK
&gt;&gt; File ""ppp"" added.
</code></pre>

<p>If I give it an invalid task name, it does error out, so it obviously is looking for the task, I'm just not sure what it's doing with it. The file never makes it up to my server.</p>

<p>How can I get it to rsync just the files I've saved?</p>

<p>N.B. <a href=""https://github.com/tschaub/grunt-newer/issues/21"" rel=""nofollow"">newer</a> doesn't seem to work either, so I'm trying to do this manually via <code>grunt.event.on('watch'</code></p>

"13398674","1","13402759","","2012-11-15 13:41:09","","4","2292","<p>I'm trying to perform two tasks (separated into 2 kernels) on the GPU using Cuda and C++. As input I take a NxM matrix (stored in memory on the host as a float array). I will then use a kernel that performs some operations on this matrix to make it a NxMxD matrix. I then have a second kernel which performs some operations on this 3D matrix (I just read the values, I don't have to write values to it). </p>

<p>Operating in texture memory seems to be much faster for my task so my question is if it is possible to copy my data from global memory on the device after kernel 1 and transfer it directly to texture memory for kernel 2 without bringing it back to the host?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I've added some code to illustrate my problem better.</p>

<p>Here are the two kernels. The first is just a place holder for now and replicates the 2D matrix into 3D. </p>

<pre><code>__global__ void computeFeatureVector(float* imData3D_dev, int imX, int imY, int imZ) {

//calculate each thread global index  
int xindex=blockIdx.x*blockDim.x+threadIdx.x; 
int yindex=blockIdx.y*blockDim.y+threadIdx.y;     

#pragma unroll
for (int z=0; z&lt;imZ; z++) { 
    imData3D_dev[xindex+yindex*imX + z*imX*imY] = tex2D(texImIp,xindex,yindex);
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The second will take this 3D matrix, now represented as a texture and perform some operations on it. Blank for now.</p>

<pre><code>__global__ void kernel2(float* resData_dev, int imX) {
//calculate each thread global index  
int xindex=blockIdx.x*blockDim.x+threadIdx.x; 
int yindex=blockIdx.y*blockDim.y+threadIdx.y;     

resData_dev[xindex+yindex*imX] = tex3D(texImIp3D,xindex,yindex, 0);

return; 
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Then the main body of the code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>// declare textures
texture&lt;float,2,cudaReadModeElementType&gt; texImIp; 
texture&lt;float,3,cudaReadModeElementType&gt; texImIp3D;

<p>Im happy that the first kernel is working correctly but the 3D matrix imData3D_dev does not seem to be bound to the texture texImIp3D correctly. </p>

<p><strong>ANSWER</strong></p>

<p>I solved my problem using cudaMemcpy3D. Here is revised code for the second part of the main function. imData3D_dev contains the 3D matrix in global memory from the first kernel.  </p>

<pre><code>    cudaArray* carrayImIp3D;
cudaExtent volumesize;
volumesize = make_cudaExtent(imX, imY, imZ);
cudaMalloc3DArray(&amp;carrayImIp3D,&amp;channel,volumesize); 
cudaMemcpy3DParms copyparms={0};

copyparms.extent = volumesize;
copyparms.dstArray = carrayImIp3D;
copyparms.kind = cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice;  
copyparms.srcPtr = make_cudaPitchedPtr((void*)imData3D_dev, sizeof(float)*imX,imX,imY); 
cudaMemcpy3D(&amp;copyparms);

// texture params and bind
texImIp3D.filterMode=cudaFilterModePoint;
texImIp3D.addressMode[0]=cudaAddressModeClamp; 
texImIp3D.addressMode[1]=cudaAddressModeClamp; 
texImIp3D.addressMode[2]=cudaAddressModeClamp;

cudaBindTextureToArray(texImIp3D,carrayImIp3D,channel); 

// store output here
float* resData_dev;
cudaMalloc((void**)&amp;resData_dev,sizeof(float)*imX*imY); 

kernel2&lt;&lt;&lt;blocknum,blocksize&gt;&gt;&gt;(resData_dev, imX); 

    // ... clean up

<p>I found <a href=""http://linux.softpedia.com/get/System/Networking/Iperf-23581.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">Iperf</a> is one such utility.

This was surprising for me as it is well known fact that UDP performs better than TCP. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Does UDP always perform better than TCP  ? or is there any specific

<p>But the problem is, the out.print inside refreshiframe gives compile error. My compiler, jdeveloper 10g, specifically says that ""variable 'out' not found"". I can use out.print outside of the method but not inside the method. How can I use out.print in the refreshiframe() method ? or is there a better way to solve this problem ? Thank you. </p>

I'm not sure why this is happening, since the code is just like any other collision detection:</p>

<p>I am not sure whether to use jQuery, JavaScript, C# or PHP for the script.
Here is what I have come up with so far in JavaScript. Am I on the right path?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" language=""javascript""&gt;

{
var d = new Date();

var hour = d.getHours(); //returns 0-23 corresponding to hours

&lt;/script&gt;

<p>Now I need help manipulating the variables 'day' and 'hour'. I came up with a generic algorithm to specify Monday through Friday, 9:00AM - 5:00PM as follows:</p>

<pre><code>if ((day&gt;0 &amp;&amp; day&lt;6) &amp;&amp; (hour&gt;8 &amp;&amp; hour&lt;18) ) //days 1 through 5 (M-F) and (hours 9:00-17:00)
{ alert(""testing"") 
//This is for testing purposes. I will eventually insert code here to display string or image perhaps? 
}

<p>Assuming the date and time are properly obtained and the if statement algorithm is correct, how do I implement the Javascript portion and ""tie the code together"" with my ASP.NET page to display a string or image based on those parameters?</p>

<p>This is my first time posting on Stackoverflow. I hope I am addressing this question properly and clearly enogh. Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I gave up on JavaScript for now. C# seems to me like the proper way of doing this. Thanks to <strong>codingbiz</strong> 's resonse, I was able to implement the script as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script runat=""server""&gt;

protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    DateTime thisTime = DateTime.Now;           // retrieve date and time
    string day = thisTime.DayOfWeek.ToString(); // declare and define day to string 
    int hour = thisTime.Hour;                   // declare and define hour to int

//check if string contains the following: ""Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursay,Friday""
if (""Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursay,Friday"".IndexOf(day) &gt; -1 &amp;&amp; hour &gt;= 9 &amp;&amp; hour &lt;= 17)
{
   conditionalLabel.Text = ""&lt;img src='sony_frontex3_repair.jpg' /&gt;"";

<p><strong>New question:</strong>
Lets say a user visits my website at 4:45PM and the image/string displays as intended. Some time goes by and it is now 5:05. Will the image/string automatically disappear, or only after the page is closed, then reopened? Will cookies or cache affect the performance of this script? Is there any such issues I need to address, such as specifying in the code to automatically refresh the page?</p>

<p>The gridview is always empty even so when I try the same approach with any <code>Northwind</code> table for example it works just fine and the same attributes that are set on <code>Northwind</code> grid, are set on Employee grid.</p>

<p>Worth to mention that when I set <code>AutoGenerateColumns</code> to <code>true</code> it works but I want to make the first <code>column(ID)</code> read only when editing.</p>

I tried mixing databinding expressions: #Eval(), #Bind() but nothing is working, another thing is when I press the edit button the data is displayed in the EditTemplate correctly and this is so weird, why the display doesn't work for just viewing the data!!!

Here's some code:
HTML</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""thumb""&gt;

        Header&lt;br&gt;
        Sub-header&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=""thumb""&gt;

        Header&lt;br&gt;
        Sub-header&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        Date
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=""thumb""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""text""&gt;
        Header&lt;br&gt;
        Sub-header&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        Date
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>CSS</p>

<pre><code>.thumb {
    width: 400px;
    height: 250px;
    background-color: silver;
    font-weight: bold;
    background: url(""http://www.imageurlhere.com"") no-repeat 50% 50%;
    -webkit-background-size: cover;
    -moz-background-size: cover;
    -o-background-size: cover;
    background-size: cover;
}

.text {
    padding: 15px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So essentially I want to alternate between a background image and the background color, so when you hover over the div the background image is show, and on mouseout the background image is hidden and you revert to the background colour (silver).<br>
I found this was do-able via pseudo classes but as this is for a CMS site the images will be changed on the fly, therefore they'll have to be inserted via html:<br></p>

<pre><code>style=""background-image: url('insert url here')""
</code></pre>

<p>Is this at all possible to hide and show the background-image?</p>

<p>The code is working brilliantly and doing everything I need it to do. It works on iPhones and iPads etc.</p>

<p>Is there a way to alter the code so that it doesn't download the music track until the user clicks the Preview button?</p>

<p>Many thanks for any help you can give me with this.</p>

The iPad is communicating properly with the iCloud container.  As I create documents, I see them pop into the iCloud store from Settings->iCloud->Storage&amp;Backup->ManageStorage->MyAppName on both the iPhone and the iPad.  The iPhone, however, seems to be connecting to it's own separate store.  Files I create there do not show up in Settings on either device but appear to go to some container somewhere.  I can see them when running an NSMetaDataQuery (but I don't see the documents from the real iCloud container).  </p>

<p>How the problem began:
When I first created the iCloud entitlement and container identifier, I omitted the ""com."" prefix from the store name.  This worked fine until I submitted an app update to Apple and they immediately rejected the upload citing an invalid iCloud container identifier.  My problems began after I changed the identifier.  I have deleted and reloaded the app on both devices, but the iPhone is still stuck using what appears to be an invisible iCloud container.</p>

<p>Please help me get my phone back in sync with the real iCloud container.  Thanks!</p>

<p>I was originally planning on using MyISAM for the tables (for the built-in <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/fulltext-search.html"">fulltext search capabilities</a>), but the thought of the <em>entire table</em> being locked due to a single write operation makes me shutter. Row-level locks make so much more sense (not to mention InnoDB's other speed advantages when dealing with huge tables). So, for this reason, I'm pretty determined to use InnoDB.</p>

<p>The problem is... InnoDB doesn't have built-in fulltext search capabilities.</p>

<p>Should I go with a third-party search system? Like <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/clucene/"">Lucene(c++)</a> / <a href=""http://www.sphinxsearch.com/"">Sphinx</a>?

<pre><code># Generate fake data
library(dplyr)
set.seed(12345)
plot.data &lt;- data.frame(fitted = rnorm(20),
                        actual = sample(0:1, 20, replace=TRUE)) %&gt;%
  arrange(fitted)

head(plot.data)
      fitted actual
1 -1.8179560      0
2 -0.9193220      1
3 -0.8863575      1
4 -0.7505320      1
5 -0.4534972      1
6 -0.3315776      0
</code></pre>

<p>I can easily plot the <code>actual</code> column from rows 1–20 as colored lines:</p>

<pre><code># Plot with lines
ggplot(plot.data, aes(x=seq(length.out = length(actual)), colour=factor(actual))) +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin=0, ymax=1))
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/AdHyl.png"" alt=""Plot with linerange""></p>

<p>The gist of this plot is to show how often the <code>actual</code> numbers appear sequentially across the range of <code>fitted</code> values. As you can see in the image, sequential 0s and 1s are readily seen as sequential blue and red vertical lines.</p>

<p>However, I'd like to move away from the lines and use <code>geom_rect</code> instead to create bands for the sequential number. I can fake this with really thick lineranges:</p>

<pre><code># Fake rectangular regions with thick lines
ggplot(plot.data, aes(x=seq(length.out = length(actual)), colour=factor(actual))) +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin=0, ymax=1), size=10)
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/fAaYz.png"" alt=""Plot with thick lines that are fake rectangles""></p>

<p>But the size of these lines is dependent on the number of observations—if they're too thick, they'll overlap. Additionally, doing this means that there are a bunch of extraneous graphical elements that are plotted (i.e. sequential rectangular sections are really just a bunch of line segments that bleed into each other). It would be better to use <code>geom_rect</code> instead.</p>

<p>However, <code>geom_rect</code> requires that data include minimum and maximum values for x, meaning that I need to reshape <code>actual</code> to look something like this instead:</p>

<pre><code>xmin xmax colour
   0    1    red
   1    5   blue
</code></pre>

<p>I need to programmatically calculate the run length of each color to mark the beginning and end of that color. I know that R has the <code>rle()</code> function, which is likely the best option for calculating the run length, but I'm unsure about how to split the run length into two columns (<code>xmin</code> and <code>xmax</code>).</p>

<p>What's the best way to calculate the run length of a variable so that <code>geom_rect</code> can plot it correctly?</p>

I wrote a normal index.jsp and also did all the struts.xml and web.xml filter mappings. Made a simple action class too with the execute() function returning a result.
But after I convert it to a war file the weirdest of things happens, the source of index.jsp changes. I'm a newbie, i have not seen something like this before.. I mean source code changing itself to something else. 
This is my index.jsp parallel to WEB-INF folder after i create the myapp.war file:</p>

$(xml).find('attr[name=user]').text( 'TEST' );  
$(xml).find('attr[name=user]').prop( 'textContent', 'TEST' );

I have looked at multiple questions and answers but cant find an answer that relates to my particular problem. can anyone see where I am going wrong with this/</p>

<p>my AJAX looks like this.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text javascript""&gt;
            $(function () 
            {
                $('SuggestionForm').on('submit', function (e) 
                {=det                               
                e.preventDefault();
                $.ajax(
                {
                    type: 'POST',
                    url: 'SuggestionSchemeForm.php',
                    dataType: 'html',
                    data: $('SuggestionForm').serialize(),
                    success: function () 
                    {
                        alert('form was submitted');
                    }
                });
                });
            });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

    int startingID = 1;

    people.add(new Person(queue));

    for(int i = 0; i &lt; people.size(); i++)

<p>Would it be smarter to store uploads in a <code>/year/month/file.ext</code> directory or is using a single directory scalable going forward?

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""yes""&gt;Drag me and you'll be able to drop divs into me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""no""&gt;Drag me but you won't be able to drop divs into me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""main""&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After dragging the div with the id of ""yes"", the code will be like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""yes""&gt;Drag me and you'll be able to drop divs into me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""no""&gt;Drag me but you won't be able to drop divs into me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""main""&gt;
     &lt;div id=""d1"" class=""droppable""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you'll drag one of the divs, the div that being dragged can enter to each div with the class of ""droppable"" (this class being added only if you drag the div from the div with the id of ""yes"".</p>

<p>Here is an example of what I want the code to look like after a lot of dragging:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""yes""&gt;Drag me and you'll be able to drop divs into me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""no""&gt;Drag me but you won't be able to drop divs into me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""main""&gt;
     &lt;div id=""d1"" class=""droppable""&gt;
          &lt;div id=""d2"" class=""droppable""&gt;&lt;div id=""d6""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div id=""d3"" style=""margin-top: 11px""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div id=""d4"" style=""margin-top: 34px;margin-right: 39px""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div id=""d5"" class=""droppable""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is, of course, just an a example of how the code can look after a lot of dragging.
The divs can be dropped only into the main div. The divs can be dragged after dropping too. The <code>style</code> with the <code>margin</code>s is by where you put the div - if it is exactly on the border of the father div, there will be no style. if you'll drop it in the middle of the box, the margin will be the location of the div...</p>

<p><strong>In conclusion, I want that if you drag a div from the div with the id of ""yes"", the div will be able to have a child div, but the div is being dragged from the div with the id ""no"", this div will never be a father div, and both of the divs will be snapping to other divs while dragging them. If div is being placed on top of a div but not inside of him (on the border), he will be snapped, but never be stayed on top of div. The divs will be ""styled"" with margins and not with <code>position: absolute</code>.</strong></p>

<p>On BinIISite.ps1 I've PS script below:</p>

<p>But when I run the startup.cmd manually in Azure VM, it seems to bind correctly. Any idea what may be wrong above?</p>

<p>This is some lines of code:</p>

<pre><code>$('.btn-more').click(function() {

        // Show that we're working.

I'm wondering if certain themes interfere with the process?</p>

<p>I'm running APEX 4.1.1.00.23.</p>

<p>My theme is Scarlet -21</p>

<p>My IR Report page template is set to 'Application Default'</p>

<p>I have a flashchart setup to produce the following link... <a href=""http://lxweb0014.in.telstra.com.au:7780/pls/nws/f?p=2979:1:1051060387366302:IR_REPORT_37740874:NO:1,RIR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lxweb0014.in.telstra.com.au:7780/pls/nws/f?p=2979:1:1051060387366302:IR_REPORT_37740874:NO:1,RIR</a>:<strong>IR_State:WA</strong></p>

<p>but no matter what I try it WILL NOT pass the 'State' filter into the IR. It does perform the reset (RIR) but nothing else.
I've tried setting a column alias, and just having the straight column name (both as ""State"") but nothing works.</p>

<p>I've tried manually creating the url as well but that doesn't work either. For some reason it just keeps ignoring the IR_ filter settings.</p>

<p>I can set the filter manually no problem at all but I want my users to be able to click on my chart column/line and for it to filter the report for them on just that data, hence the need for passing filters.</p>

<p>So, like I said, I'm thinking there may be a setting somewhere in my IR that allows remotely setting filters or something??
Any help would be greatly appreciated. :)</p>

<p>I would not only like to do this on my Facebook application which is fairly similar to the website itself just a little more integration with Facebook, posting to wall and whatnot, but on the main website too. The reason why I have mentioned this is, as you may or may not know, one way of having an application on Facebook is to tell Facebook where the directory is and whatever on that directory on wards is shown in an iframe.</p>

<p>With Facebook going to my chosen directory and showing this on Facebook via an iframe, well, I don't exactly know what goes on, if they're on my website as well as Facebook or whatnot and due to being fairly new to the likes of PHP, I do apologize if this question seems a little messy but I do hope I do explain myself.</p>

<p>I've been told that the best option is to use HTML5 Geolocation as my primary method with a fallback to a better IP geolocator is my best option to find out their location, then I would like to check their current weather via the Met Office website ( <a href=""http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint/product/uk-3hourly-site-specific-forecast/detailed-documentation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint/product/uk-3hourly-site-specific-forecast/detailed-documentation</a> ) to then know what stylesheet should be used.</p>

<p>Different stylesheets are being developed for most conditions such as; Showers, Heavy Rain, Overcast, Sunny, Snow and so on until they are all developed to customize the experience for the user and to also show different div's depending on their weather and show them their forecast. An example of a div could be; if it's snowing, it would ask them if they would want any snow to be ploughed.</p>

<p>Lastly, something I should have also asked and mentioned earlier, I would also like this feature to work for UK users to avoid any confusion and if it is possible to see how far the user is from where they are based as he has only told me he'll do up to a 100 mile radius and if it helps him pay for his bills and whatnot he'll go there, but is there a way to check how far away they are for a contact form or to show on screen or whatnot.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Show different graphics depending on their location's weather and to see how far they are away from the base and show their weather forecast and if possible to change the weather upon the 3 hourly update.
  Inform non-UK users that this is a UK only business and it would cost too much to go there.</p>
</blockquote>

Tim</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/fcy8F.png"" alt=""entire vascular tree""></p>

<p>The model is in a STL format, thus I have the x-y-z coordinates of all vertices. The lines should run through the center of the vessel mesh thus I thought that the best approach would be a <strong>spline regression through the vertex cloud</strong>. <strong>In addition it would be great if I can have the radius of the vessel at given points</strong>, e.g. the coordinates of the polyline.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/1jfYa.png"" alt=""part of the tree shown as mesh""></p>

<p>I looked through this forum and the VTK website (assuming they have a straightforward implementation for this sort of thing) but so far I haven't found something I can use. Does anyone know of a Python module or VTK class (which I would call from Python) that can do this? The python modules I found on this are all for 2D data.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>EDIT:
I came across this library called <a href=""http://www.vmtk.org/Main/Overview/"" rel=""nofollow"">VMTK</a> that deals almost exclusively with vessel segmentation and has functionality for what they call '<a href=""http://www.vmtk.org/Tutorials/Centerlines/"" rel=""nofollow"">centerline calculation</a>'. However, they usually require the vessels to be 'cut' at their ends and 'source points' to be defined. In the case of my model, however, one can see that the end points are 'capped' which makes matters more complicated. If I find a solution I'll post here</p>

<p>Hello,  On our homepage there is a vertical scrolling carousel.  What I want to do is have it gracefully fail to use only css if javascript is turned off.  So that the result is text with a vertical scroll bar the user can click and drag to move through the list.  Similar to what you mind find on a textarea element, that has too much data to display at once.</p>

As I am mainly a MS-SQL user, I feel quite unconfortable with MySQL replication terminology, and the multiple MySQL versions that do not do exactly the same thing the same way. </p>

<p>My objective is, as per SQL terminology, to have a publisher and many subscribers. Suscribers are open to user updates. Changes are replicated with the publisher, which will then distribute these changes to other suscribers.</p>

<p>So my objective is here to determine the correct primary key rule to be used for our tables. As we want exclusively surrogate keys, we have the possibility to use either integer\autoincrement or uuid/uuid_short fields. In order to avoid replication conflicts, the integer\autoincrement does not fits our needs, as it can create replication conflicts when, between two synchronisations, both servers insert a record in the same table. So, according to me, the correct solution to avoid replication\primary key conflicts would be to:</p>

<ul>
<li>use uuid or uuid-short fields as primary keys</li>
<li>have the corresponding uuid values set by the server at INSERT time</li>
<li>set the replication to RBR (Row Based Replication - sounds equivalent to MS-SQl merge replication) mode, and not SBR (Statement Based Replication - sounds like transactional replication). As I understand it, RBR will insert the calculated uuid value 'as is' in the other servers at replication time, while SBR will recall the uuid() function and generate a new value on each server ... thus causing a major problem! </li>
</ul>

<p>Will it work?</p>

<p>My implementation doesn't seem to be working and I don't know why. </p>

<p>Here are the facts of my code:</p>

<ul>
<li>textureArray is an NSMutableArray populated by GLKTextureInfo objects</li>
<li>groupMesh is an array of a struct that contains:
<ul>
<li>a pointer to the place in the index array that we want to get indices from.</li>
<li>the size of the index data</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>-</p>

<ul>
<li>I have one element array buffer for my vertices and one for my indices</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to make a for loop. In each iteration I bind a different texture from the GLKTextureInfo array, and I change the pointer to the area of memory of the index data I want to draw with the texture that I just bound. </p>

<p>-</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i&lt;mesh-&gt;numMeshes-1; i++)
{
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D,
                  [(GLKTextureInfo *)[textureArray objectAtIndex:i] name]);


    glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES,
                        mesh-&gt;groupMesh[i].indexDataSize*4,
                        GL_UNSIGNED_INT,
                        mesh-&gt;groupMesh[i].indexPointer);

}
</code></pre>

<p>The first texture in the array is a tree bark texture, the second texture is tree leaves.</p>

<p>The textures aren't binding after the first iteration however. Which is giving this kind of result:</p>

<p><img src=""http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/5138/tbko.png""></p>

<p>I forced the loop to test if my theory was correct and changed objectAtIndex:i to objectAtIndex:1, and the leaf texture appeared all over:</p>

<p><img src=""http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/5598/c05n.png""></p>

<p>So it just seems to be glBindTexture that isn't working, is it because opengl is already in the draw state? Is there a way around this?</p>

<p>Note:(I asked a similar question yesterday, but now I've done a bit more research and still I don't know what I'm doing wrong).</p>

It works well, except that when you navigate between sub-menu items, the selected main menu item changes it's text color for just a second because of the css border that I have used. This isn't very noticeable, but it has been bugging me for ages! I want to keep the border separating the submenus, but I don't want the flash! Is there some timer that I could use to fix this? Or could I make the border so that it is inside the box? Thank you so much for any help!</p>

<p>To jump straight to the issue, open this jsfiddle in Safari and start to scroll down the page:
<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/davereed362205122/8bZxb/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/davereed362205122/8bZxb/2/</a></p>

<p>The scenario:</p>

<p>I have a two column page setup with a right column menu and the following div:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""col-md-push-9 col-md-3""&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>(The menu needs to show up at the top on mobile devices, hence the push)</p>

<p>Within that div is the affix menu:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""affix-menu"" data-spy=""affix"" &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The main content area is within a div like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""col-md-9 col-md-pull-3""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works really well in Firefox and Chrome, but for some reason in Safari the affix portion does not stay confined to the div and overlaps the main content. Taking a look at Bootstrap's own site (<a href=""http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#affix"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#affix</a>), it appears they don't use any push or pulls for their divs, so the menu simply shows up at the bottom in mobile. I'm hoping I don't have to revert to this...</p>

<p><strong>[tblItem]</strong><br>
ItemID (AutoNumber)<br>
MainText (Text)</p>

<p><strong>[tblCategory]</strong><br>
CategoryID (AutoNumber)<br>
Name (Text)  </p>

<p><strong>[tblItemCategory]</strong><br>
ItemID (Long Integer)<br>
CategoryID (Long Integer)</p>

<p>I want to build a panel component which shows a category name at the top, with a databound grid of items belonging to that grid below. There will be many instances of this panel component, and the end-user should be able to create a new item and simultaneously assign it to the category in question from any one of them.</p>

<p>In MS Access, it's possible to create a nested form, with the ""child"" one databound to a query which is ""MasterFields"" linked to a databound ""Category"" field on the ""parent"" form, such that the grid of items changes as the Category field is changed. This Items grid can also easily have new records added to it, with both the ItemID (in tblItem AND table tblItemCategory) and the linked CategoryID field (in tblItemCategory) being populated automatically. </p>

<p>The query for that Access form's grid is:<br>
SELECT tblItemCategory.CategoryID, tblItem.*<br>
FROM tblItemCategory LEFT JOIN tblItem ON tblItemCategory.ItemID = tblItem.ItemID<br>
ORDER BY tblItemCategory.CategoryID;</p>

<p>If I try the same thing in Delphi, the ItemID AutoNumber field doesn't get populated, resulting in the following error: </p>

<p><em>..exception class EOleException with message 'The field 'tblItemCategory.ItemID' cannot contain a Null value because the Required property for this field is set to True.  Enter a value in this field'.</em></p>

<p>..and the ItemID field is accordingly blank in the grid. </p>

<p>Is there a way to get Delphi/ADO to handle the behind-the-scenes two-table ItemID population as easily/neatly as Access does, without manually handling it programmatically? If not, what's the best/most elegant way to handle it programmatically?</p>

<p>I'd like to keep whatever solution I end up with as closely tied to the conventional TDataSet / TDataSource approach as possible, as I use a number of different kinds of databound controls, all of which will have to deal with this same data structure.</p>

<p>Those resources should probably:</p>

<ul>
<li>Teach me the basics of Linux (not only how to use mouse, but most important commands, shell scripts etc).</li>
<li>Provide information about using the tooling (especially IDE, shortcuts, tricks etc). <strong>Note</strong> is that I don't need info about the basics of the language, OOP/D, TDD etc as I am already proficient in that but on the .NET/Windows platform. </li>
<li>Describe Hosting and deployment of Java apps on Linux (and/or maybe Windows).</li>

<p>I researched this problem online and found the <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/howto/recover-corrupted-blob-object.txt"">article</a> by Linus Torvalds, but got lost at the point where he found the broken link ID: none of my file IDs, tree or blob, match the culprit ID thrown by the error message.</p>

<p>I then returned to the article on recovering <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/801577/how-to-recover-git-objects-damaged-by-hard-disk-failure"">""git objects damaged by hard disk failure""</a> and (after moving the culprit object out of the way) worked my way through until </p>

<pre><code>$ cat packed-refs
</code></pre>

<p>at which point my computer said: <code>cat: packed-refs: No such file or directory</code>
I skipped that step and did the</p>

<pre><code>$ git fsck --full
</code></pre>

<p>and got the appropriate output, but then I was supposed to copy the culprit (or what I was referring to as the culprit, the sha1 ID thrown by the error) from a backup repository back into the main repository, then copy the missing objects from the backup repository into the main repository, as far as I can tell; and I don't want to do anything <em>too</em> drastic or I might force something I can't unforce later.</p>

<p>So my question(s) is (are), was I supposed to have made a backup (<em>ooh, newbie alert</em>), or was that what happened when I unpacked the .pack file? And is the ""culprit"" I'm copying back actually a clean file, i.e. not corrupted?</p>

<p>(I think it only fair to tell you that I was initially confused by a simple dash in Torvalds' file between the ""git"" and ""fsck."" So I'm <em>REALLY</em> new at this.)</p>

<p>The other problem is that there are about 500 such select boxes and I do not wish to add a span layer in the HTML code for each of those boxes to accomplish the goal.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>What can I do please?</p>

<p><strong>Possible Solution:</strong></p>

<p>After Tony's tip I came up with this:</p>

<pre><code>- property: friends
      external_name: friends
      # Type: Key Stats: 2 properties of this type in this kind.
      import_transform: myfriends.stringToValue(';') 
      export_transform: myfriends.valueToString(';')
</code></pre>

<p><strong>myfriends.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>def valueToString(delimiter):
    def key_list_to_string(value):
        keyStringList = []
        if value == '' or value is None or value == []:
            return None 
        for val in value:                
            keyStringList.append(transform.key_id_or_name_as_string(val))        
        return delimiter.join(keyStringList)
    return key_list_to_string
</code></pre>

<p>And this works! The encoding is in Unicode though: UTF-8. Make sure to open the file in LibreOffice as such or you would see garbled content.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge is import.  This is what I came up with without any luck:</p>

<pre><code>def stringToValue(delimiter):    
    def string_to_key_list(value):
        keyvalueList = []
        if value == '' or value is None or value == []:
            return None        
        for val in value.split(';'):            
            keyvalueList.append(transform.create_foreign_key('User'))        
        return keyvalueList
    return string_to_key_list
</code></pre>

<p>I get the error message:</p>

<pre><code>BadValueError: Unsupported type for property friends: &lt;type 'function'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>According to Datastore viewer, I need to create something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[datastore_types.Key.from_path(u'User', u'kave@gmail.com', _app=u's~myapp1')] 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>Tony you are to be a real expert in Bulkloader. Thanks for your help.  Your solution worked!
I have moved my other question to a new thread.</p>

<p>But one crucial problem that appears is that, when I create new users I can see my <code>friends</code> field shown as <code>&lt;missing&gt;</code> and it works fine.</p>

<p>Now when I use your solution to upload the data, I see for those users without any friend entries a <code>&lt;null&gt;</code> entry.  Unfortunately this seems to break the model since friends can't be null.</p>

<p>Changing the model to reflect this, seems to be ignored.</p>

<pre><code>friends = ndb.KeyProperty(kind='User', repeated=True, required=False)
</code></pre>

<p>How can I fix this please?</p>

<p><strong>update:</strong></p>

<p>digging further into it:
when the status <code>&lt;missing&gt;</code> is shown in the data viewer, in code it shows <code>friends = []</code>
However when I upload the data via csv I get a <code>&lt;null&gt;</code>, which translates to <code>friends = [None]</code>. I know this, because I exported the data into my local data storage and could follow it in code.  Strangely enough if I empty the list <code>del user.friends[:]</code>, it works as expected.  There must be a beter way to set it while uploading via csv though...</p>

<p><strong>Final Solution</strong></p>

<p>This turns out to be a <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3646"" rel=""nofollow"">bug</a> that hasn't been resolved since over one year.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, even though there is no value in csv, because a list is expected, gae makes a list with a None inside.  This is game breaking, since retrieval of such a model ends up in an instant crash.</p>

<p>Adding a <code>post_import_function</code>, which deletes the lists with a None inside.</p>

<p>In my case:</p>

<pre><code>def post_import(input_dict, instance, bulkload_state_copy):
    if instance[""friends""] is None:
        del instance[""friends""]
    return instance
</code></pre>

<p>Finally everything works as expected.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button id=""create"" type=""button""&gt;add div&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and I want to add a new div element to the document body everytime I click on the button using the jQuery UI dialog box, like this:</p>

<pre><code>var form = $(""&lt;div&gt;"", {id:""form""});

    form.append(
        $(""&lt;input&gt;"")
            .attr({
                ""type"" : ""text"",
                ""id"" : ""user-input""
            })
    )
    .dialog({
        width: 600,
        buttons: {
            ""Ok"": function() {
                var new_div = $(""&lt;div&gt;"").html($(""#user-input"").val()).addClass(""destiny_div"");
                new_div.appendTo($(""body""));
                $(this).dialog(""close"");
            }}
    });
</code></pre>

<p>The first time I click on the button it works fine, but the second time, the text that I write into the input text box does not get updated with the new value, instead it takes the first placed value.</p>

<p>For example, if the first time I type ""hello"" and click on the ""ok"" button, a new div will be added to the body with the text ""hello"" in it, but when I do it a second time, now typing ""goodbye"", a new div will be added, but with the text ""hello"" in it, instead of ""goodbye"".</p>

<p>Here is the code I have: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/vWQ9T/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/vWQ9T/</a></p>

<p>Any ideas on why it is working like this?

Since some users have limited mobile data plans and some don't, I would like to know if I could develop a switch to disable mobile data for my specific app.
A bit like what Android's own Data usage -> mobile -> App ->""Restrict background data"" does...</p>

<p>it says (and does) that it ""disables background data on mobile data network only. Wi-Fi will be used if available."", I want that but not just on background.</p>

<p>I do know that I can't change the ""Restrict background data"" option, as it would make it useless if applications could untoggle it ... but is there a way i can programmatically say now my app is blocked access to mobile data, now it isn't?</p>

<p>as insight for why I want this, I am trying to not call remote access calls when the user selects a given option(which I did and works), but there are some data leakage (some kbs per day) that I cant seem to block ... either due to the system keeping http connections or some other obscure reason...</p>

<p>I'm seeing these data transfers on DDMS perspective on eclipse on the network statistics for my app.</p>

I'm using SPEC2008 which can be downloaded <a href=""http://www.spec.org/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>I installed spec2008 (<code>java -jar SPECjvm2008_1_01_setup.jar</code>) and ran it (<code>java -jar SPECjvm2008.jar</code> as written in the README file).
I got a <strong>results</strong> file and a report that everything completed successfully.</p>

<p>Now i need to examine how some changes affect SPEC's running time.</p>

<p>I made the changes in some of SPEC'S files (the java files inside the following folders: <code>compiler</code>,<code>compress</code>,<code>crypto</code>,<code>derby</code>).</p>

<p>Now i can't run it again using <code>java -jar SPECjvm2008.jar</code> because the changes i made include <code>jomp</code> commands (<code>\\omp parallel for</code> and such). [JOMP is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenMP</a> for JAVA]</p>

<p>To compile files with such commands i used to do the following:</p>

<p>First, download <a href=""http://www2.epcc.ed.ac.uk/computing/research_activities/jomp/download/"" rel=""nofollow"">JOMP</a>. Then:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>change <code>.java</code> extension to <code>.jomp</code> . Then type:</p>

<pre><code>java jomp.compiler.Jomp MyFile
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>(now i got a <code>.java</code> file)</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>compile to <code>.class</code>:</p>

<pre><code>javac -classpath YourJompDownloadPath\jomp1.0b.jar; MyFile.java
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>java -Djomp.threads=n MyPackage.MyFile</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>So i can't do this now because:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are too many files and it would take time changing all extensions to <code>.jomp</code></li>
<li>There are too many files and i need to run all of them as a whole (just as SPEC does), but in <code>JOMP</code> commands i only know how to run each file independently.</li>
</ol>

<p>If there's a workaround for #2 then i'll do #1 manually. So i'm especially looking for a solution/workaround for #2.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong></p>

<p>OK so i made a <code>.BAT</code> file only for step 1 (see method <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9885241/changing-all-files-extensions-in-a-folder-with-one-command-on-windows"">here</a>) because it seems that SPEC has only <code>.java</code> files so i'll provide it with <code>.java</code> files only. For the 2nd step i think i need to just run SPEC (<code>java -jar SPECjvm2008.jar</code>). For the 3rd step, i think instead of normally running SPEC, i need to run it with the parameters in step 3 (<code>Djomp.threads</code>). That is:</p>

<pre><code>java -Djomp.threads=n -jar SPECjvm2008.jar
</code></pre>

<p>Now there's a new problem. I get the warning:</p>

<pre><code>Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details
</code></pre>

<p>Which was addressed <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8215781/how-do-i-compile-with-xlintunchecked"">here</a>. But in that link it's run with <code>javac</code> and not <code>java</code>. <code>javac</code> doesn't recognize the parameter <code>Djomp.threads</code> (and <code>java</code> doesn't recognize <code>Xlint</code>). So i think i'm looking for a way to run a <code>.jar</code> file while using <code>Djomp.threads</code> and <code>Xlint</code>.</p>

<p>Note: running the <code>.jar</code> file <strong>SPECjvm2008.jar</strong> eventually runs the <code>java</code> files i need. That's why i said ""<em>i'm looking for a way to run a <code>.jar</code> file...</em>""</p>

<p>I can't quite figure out what I'm doing wrong with the math. I've played around with the adding and subtracting of 1's but to no avail. Thanks in advance! And sorry for the tall post</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To try to make the problem clearer, when I'm on every 10th page (10,20,30,...), that's when it shows the next set of ten links. It shows them a page to soon when on the 10th page.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I replaced the block that contains the paging function (starting with <code>$start = $pageNumber - ($pageNumber % $numLinks) + 1;</code> and ending before <code>$pagingLink = implode(' &lt;sp&gt;|&lt;/sp&gt; ', $pagingLink);</code>) with this:</p>

                $start_counter = $pageNumber - ($max_page_links - (ceil($totalResults / $itemPerPage) - $pageNumber)) + 1;

<p>Those familiar to the standardization nightmare of the RSS-family, may know
that RSS does not provide you with information if for example the ""description"" element
contains just plain text or html or xhtml.</p>

<p>I currently use the ROME-API to convert from various RSS versions to Atom 1.0. 
The Rome-API will happily
parse the RSS and later output an Atom  feed. Atom fortunately has a means to declare a summary to contain text, html or xhtml.</p>

<p>Example.
RSS:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;item&gt;
       &lt;link&gt;http://www.schwarzwaelder-bote.de/wm?catId=79039&amp;amp;artId=14737088&amp;amp;rss=true&lt;/link&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Analyse: Winter reißt Löcher in Straßen und Kassen&lt;/title&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>becomes:
ATOM:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;entry&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Analyse: Winter reißt Löcher in Straßen und Kassen&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link rel=""alternate"" href=""http://www.schwarzwaelder-bote.de/wm?catId=79039&amp;amp;artId=14737088&amp;amp;rss=true"" /&gt;
  &lt;author&gt;
    &lt;name /&gt;
  &lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;http://www.schwarzwaelder-bote.de/wm?catId=79039&amp;amp;artId=14737088&amp;amp;rss=true&lt;/id&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>The problem is <code>type=""text""</code> which tells feed-readers like firefox to render the content of the summary as text --> you get to see all the html-source.</p>

<p><strong>Short version</strong>: How do I detect that the content of the description element is (X)HTML so I can set the correct type attribute?</p>

<ol>
<li>Web Server </li>
<li>Rest API Server (handles web authentication and all database models)</li>
</ol>

<p>We are using password granttype/2-legged oauth2 for authentication. When someone performs a login on the webserver, an API authentication request is sent to the API server, based on the response the Auth::instance is set on the web server. Everything works fine up to this point. </p>

<p>We have an automatic crud controller on the API server, but I want to make this available only to an ""admin"" account after logging in on the web server. I am trying to find a way to pass authentication from <code>Auth::instance()-&gt;logged_in()</code> on the web server back to the API server, so that the crud controller is only available if you had been logged in on the web server.</p>

<p>Any creative advice on how to achieve this? The major challenge is that the API server is running ouath2 and auth (ORM driver), but the web server is running a custom Auth driver based on a successful consumer API login.</p>

<p>Here is the flow:</p>

<ul>
<li>User visits web server</li>
<li>User logs in</li>
<li>web server sends oath2 authentication request to API server</li>
<li>api server access client database validates request, returns
access_token</li>
<li>web server sets <code>Auth::instance()-&gt;logged_in()</code> if access_token is
present</li>
<li>CRUD link is displayed based on admin role</li>
<li>CRUD link is a controller on the API server</li>
<li><strong>[need to validate the user was authenticated here]</strong></li>
<li>CRUD controller is displayed (cross-url link, not HMVC included
controller)</li>

<p>I've been developing an application that runs on an embedded version of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. When the application starts up, it reads in a config file off of an SD card, initializes a few classes, starts a logger which writes to the SD card, and then proceeds with it's operation. During development, it has been running fine when I start it manually through an SSH terminal.</p>

<p>I've recently been experimenting with having the application start automatically when the OS starts up. I have a script in init.d which does just that. However, I noticed that no log files are being generated now. I figured out it's not a problem with the SD card not being available because the config file gets read properly on startup, but an error is thrown when I attempt to open the log file for writing using fopen.</p>

<pre><code>// Open the file
mLogFile = fopen(filename, ""wb"");
if(mLogFile == NULL)
{
    printf(""Error opening Log File [%d].\n"", lnRetval);
    return -1; //File couldn't be opened
}
</code></pre>

<p>I assumed it was just a permissions problem, but I can't understand why it doesn't work when I automatically start the software versus running it manually in a terminal. Furthermore, I can't understand why the config file gets read in properly but this file can't be opened.</p>

<p>The only difference I could see was that the config file reading is done using fstreams, while the logger is using C file I/O. So I experimented by placing the following code directly before the fopen call above (/home/root/etc is where the SD card is mounted).</p>

<pre><code>std::ofstream out(""/home/root/etc/log/testlog.log"");
out &lt;&lt; ""I can write using fstreams.\n"";
out.close();
</code></pre>

<p>That worked and generated the file when started through init.d. Now I'm completely stumped. Why does ofstream work and not fopen? Is there something fundamentally I'm missing?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>i created the following attribute:</p>

<pre><code>Enumeration&lt;T&gt; = class(TCustomAttribute)
strict private
    { Private declarations }
    FValues : TList&lt;T&gt;;
public
    { Public declarations }
    constructor Create(const AValues : array of T);
    destructor Destroy(); override;
public
    { Public declarations }
    property Values : TList&lt;T&gt; read FValues;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>with that in mind, i can use this attribute just fine in the following class for example:</p>

<pre><code>[Entity('tablename')]
TUser = class(TEntity)
strict private
   [Column('idcolumnname')]
   [PrimaryKey(True)]
   Fid : TInteger;

   [Column('typecolumnname')]
   [Enumeration&lt;string&gt;(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', '...'])]
   Ftype: TEnumeration&lt;string&gt;;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>it is great that it worked but idk, it seems to me that this should'nt work, couse in my ignorance, delphi attributes expect only constant types and im not only using array as a paremeter but a generic one.</p>

<p>moving foward, i made this attribute:</p>

<pre><code>Association = class(TCustomAttribute)
strict private
    { Private declarations }
    FMasterKeys : TList&lt;string&gt;;
    FDetailKeys : TList&lt;string&gt;;
public
    { Public declarations }
    constructor Create(const AMasterKeys, ADetailKeys : array of string);
    destructor Destroy(); override;
public
    { Public declarations }
    property MasterKeys : TList&lt;string&gt; read FMasterKeys;
    property DetailKeys : TList&lt;string&gt; read FDetailKeys;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>and tried to use on this class:</p>

<pre><code>[Entity('tablename')]
TSuperUser = class(TEntity)
strict private
    [Association(['masterkey'], ['detailkey'])]
    Fuser : TAssociation&lt;TUser&gt;;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>i got a error [DCC Error] E2026 Constant expression expected.</p>

<p>ok, so in resume i just dont know whats happening why i can use a array of T as a attribute parameter and not a array of string for instance.</p>

<p>thx for any help in advance</p>

I have a number of checkboxes (19 currently) in a form that I am trying to create a dynamic ""and"" condition to display or not display markers.   The code works great for the individual pieces when a single checkbox is selected.   I would like to have the code take into account if multiple checkboxes are selected and only display those markers that meet all conditions not just add the ones that meet the next condition.</p>

<p>Givens:</p>

<ol>
<li>The checkbox ids are ""q""+#</li>
<li>Each Google Marker has values of true or false for each q#(checkbox) the code is below:
createMarker(point,html,q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6, q7, q8, q9, q10, q11, q12, q13, q14, q15, q16, q17, q18, q19)</li>
<li>There are many Marker Points</li>
</ol>

<p>Need:</p>

<p>If checkbox 1 and 2 are checked only display those markers that have q1 = true ""and"" q2 = true in the createMarker variables.  However, also allow for a single checkbox to be checked and the correct Markers displayed
I need this condition for all possibilities of checkboxes being selected (1 to 19).</p>

When Google decided to merge google+ accounts with youtube, this account became some sort of secondary account to my G+ one, now I have to login to my google account and select that one to enter it.</p>

<p>Now my scripts stopped working because I can't access that account using a script. ""$youtube->playlistItems->insert"" gives me a ""forbidden"" exception because I'm trying to insert an item in a playlist that I don't own, and apparently I can't get an access token for the account with the playlists that I want to update with the scripts for some reason. When I try to login with that one to get a token, I get a ""forbidden"" error. </p>

<p>So, is there any way to get a token for it or to give access to my other account to change my playlists? Or at least any way to update it using a server side script? </p>

<p>Is there anyway to programmatically query for all workflows, and get their status? Either through a CAML query or the the object model?</p>

<p>I realize that I can iterate over all items in sharepoint, and see if there is a workflow attached, and then get the status. However, that is overkill, as there are 100,000s of items, and only a small subset have workflows.

<p>It's actually pretty basic, I have built a website, of which I am the only one in my organization with enough experience to manipulate the data as it is changed.  Like many businesses, they care about this.  Heaven forbid something should happen to me or I decide to take a vacation, they need a simple way to manipulate all the data in the website from a single file.  Naturally, I thought of XML (although I wouldn't be surprised if there were other solutions).  My problem is that I have spent all my time studying, programming languages and markup languages, and this will be the first time I have ever worked with XML (at least at the code level).</p>

<p>Here is what must be accomplished:</p>

<p>Multiple different htms, which need to be injected with content from tags in an xml file.  Ideally, we want to even change the number of events at any given time and since the code for the site loads the events in an iframe, each event corresponds to a new htm (or cshtml, if need be, as I use WebMatrix), thus I need to dynamically create and delete files from the server (obviously requiring server side programming).</p>

<p>I realize this is a lot of information at once, so let me try to simplify:</p>

<p>I use WebMatrix</p>

<p>Need help picking the necessary tags individaully and loading them into JavaScript (from there I can easily put it where I want in the html/cshtml file).</p>

<p>Help with the Razor(C#) code that ""might"" allow me to dynamically create files or delete files from the server based off of the same entries in the single XML file.</p>

<p>I do know some jQuery and have used it several times before.</p>

<p>As much help as i can get on this would certainly be appreciated, but I understand this is a very specific and somewhat ""muddy"" scenario, so I'll take anything I can get.</p>

<p>It returns:</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> I found out that when I call REQUEST URI inside the action method:</p>

<p><code>$this-&gt;get('request')-&gt;server-&gt;get('REQUEST_URI')</code> </p>

<p>PHP will return the URL called by the render, in this case is:</p>

However, I cannot seem to solve it using my test framework with selenium webdriver and css / xpath locators.</p>

<p>I am using python with selenium webdriver in an attempt to browse through data points of a line chart similar to that seen at <a href=""http://www.highcharts.com/demo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.highcharts.com/demo/</a>. My chart is a TIme based chart with a line and bar chart in one. I have hidden the bar chart for test purposes so as to view only the line chart. I'm trying to use the mouse over functionality to display the tooltip for each data point on my chart, and theN extract the data shown. </p>

<p>This is working fine for other formatted charts (bar/pie/donut) as each data item is seen as a separate highcharts-series but the line chart seems to be a single highcharts-series with a single path element containing the element d = all the data points. </p>

<p>I can not find a way to browse through all the data points within my line shown. My line chart contains 1 single data series with 24 points (each hour of the day)</p>

<ol>
<li>Using <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/2/ptrace"" rel=""nofollow"">ptrace</a>, but this seems to have a high overhead. According to my knowledge, tools like strace also use ptrace internally.</li>
<li>Using a kernel module to change the system call table, but according to my knowledge, this method is no more possible in later linux kernels.</li>
<li>Using LD_PRELOAD. But this won't work if for example you directly make a system call without using some wrapper library function for that system call.</li>

<p>So you see all the above mentioned methods have flaws. So my question is what is the way to intercept system calls without modifying the kernel and with minimal overhead.</p>

<p>After following all the steps to copy my local site1 install to a local site2 location, I can't login to WP at site2, and the site2 website doesn't display the <code>front-page.php</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Here are the steps I did so far:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Current local WP website is located here: <code>C:\xampp\htdocs\site1\localWP</code>
(Note: DB name: localwp; user: wpxxxx; password:xxxxxxxxsite1, table prefix: wpsite1_)</p></li>
<li><p>Create new folder here: <code>C:\xampp\htdocs\site2\localWP2</code></p></li>
<li><p>Copy all files from site1’s localWP folder to site2’s localWP2 folder</p></li>
<li><p>Go to <code>localhost/phpmyadmin/</code>, and click on Databases tab.
At top, type in new database name: <code>localwp2</code>, and select <code>utf8_general_ci</code> for collation.  Click on Create button.  I got a success message, and now see the new DB listed (but no tables created yet).</p></li>
<li><p>At top, click on Users tab. In middle of page, click on Add user link.
Type in user name: wpxxxx2.  Click on Local for host (localhost).  Type in password xxxxxxxxsite2 twice.  Click all for Global privileges.  Click on Go button. I got a success message, and now see the new user name listed.</p></li>
<li><p>On side bar, click on the DB name for the original DB: localwp.
At top, click on Export tab.  Click on Custom export method. Then click on Select All link under Tables.  Under Output, click on Save output to a file radio button.
At the bottom, click on Go button.  The backed up SQL file was saved to downloads.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, on left side bar, click on the new DB name: <code>localwp2</code>.
At top, click on Import tab.  Click on Browse button, and locate file I just exported, and click open.  Go to bottom, and click on Go button.  I got a message that 81 queries were executed. (same as what was on the localwp, so that is good!)</p></li>
<li><p>Click on localwp2 on sidebar, and I can see all the tables. (But the table names are still prefixed with <code>wpsite1_</code>, where I wanted them to be <code>wpsite2_</code>  due to the export.)</p></li>
<li><p>Now, go to <code>site2/localWP2</code>, and edit the <code>wp-config.php</code> file.  Change the follow lines of code from:</p>

<pre><code>   define('DB_NAME', 'localwp');
   define('DB_USER', 'wpxxxx');
   define('DB_PASSWORD', 'xxxxxxxxsite1');
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>   define('DB_NAME', 'localwp2');
   define('DB_USER', 'wpxxxx2');
   define('DB_PASSWORD', 'xxxxxxxxsite2');
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Go to new website location: <code>localhost/site2/localWP2</code>
I get a site up, but the front-page.php is not displaying.  It looks like it is serving the <code>index.php</code> page instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Login into wp.  Since I copied over the previously installed wp files, I have to use my original localwp user ID and password that I created when I did the initial install - right??.  Which is dfxxxxx and xxxxxxxxxxx.  But when I go to <code>localhost/site2/localWP2/wp-admin</code>, and try to login with the above userid,  it immediately re-directs to this:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost/site1/localWP/wp-login.php?redirect_to=http://localhost/site2/localWP2/wp-admin/&amp;reauth=1 
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>(and of course if I login, I am inside the site1/localWP, not the new site2/localWP2.)</p>

<p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>I think I am missing some step that will allow me login to wp on my site2.  This might be resolved if I install the search &amp; replace plugin and could search the <code>localwp2</code> database and replace: all references to localwp to localwp2; all references to <code>localhost/site1/localWP</code> to <code>localhost/site2/localWP2</code> and all references to WP Site 1 to WP Site 2.  But since I can't login to site2's WP install I can't do that. (I think if I try it, all I will be doing is changing my original install on my original DB.. not the new one.)</p></li>
<li><p>Even though I can get to the home page of <code>localhost/site2/localWP2</code> (which is showing index.php instead of <code>front-page.php</code>), I can't tell if the rest of the site is OK, because as soon as I click on any other page, it immeditaly goes to the localhost/site1/localWP/... (whatever page)</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>What do I need to do to fix my new site location to get the home page to show properly, and all the other pages displaying on site2.</p></li>
<li><p>What do I need to do to be able to login to WP for site2.</p></li>
<li><p>How can I get the tables of the new database localwp2 to have table prefixes of <code>wpsite2_</code>.  At this point, is it too late to try changing my <code>wp-config.php</code> to this: <code>$table_prefix  = 'wpsite2_';</code>   (or should I not bother as it doesn't really matter)?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(3a. NOTE: I just tried changing the table prefix and went to my site2 location, and it resolved to this: <code>localhost/site2/localWP2/wp-admin/install.php</code>.. where it looks like it wants me to reinstall WP.  So I just changed it back to the original prefix of <code>wpsite1_</code>.  Guess I answered my own questions.. that it can't be changed in the <code>wp-config.php</code>.  I think would have to run some SQL against the database to change the table prefix there, and then change it in the config file.. so I think it is in the too hard basket, as long as it doesn't really matter!)  I would be curious for future installs how to get the table prefix changed (and at what point it should be done), if you have some resource you can point me to.)</p>

<p>Any suggestions for me would be greatly appreciated!!</p>

The first <code>xlsws_product</code> has all the product info the second <code>xlsws_category_assn</code> contains two columns one with category id and the other with product id. The category names are in a third table but I don't need them for this. </p>

<p>What I am looking to do is select the rows from the product table that are in the categories with id 210, 218 and 370. This is what I tried so far:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM xlsws_product
JOIN xlsws_product_category_assn ON xlsws_product.id = xlsws_product_category_assn.product_id
WHERE 
    xlsws_product_category_assn.category_id = '210' OR '218' OR '370'`
</code></pre>

<p>The result for this gave me 24090 rows from a bunch of categories and there should only by a handful of rows in those categories. What's bizarre here is that there are 56474 rows in the product table so I'm not sure how the results are being filtered.</p>

<p>Just for the hell of it I tried limiting my query to just one category id with the following query: </p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM xlsws_product
JOIN xlsws_product_category_assn ON xlsws_product.id = xlsws_product_category_assn.product_id
WHERE xlsws_product_category_assn.category_id = '210'

<p>This yielded zero rows... </p>

<p>I'm sure there is something simple I am missing but after spending a while searching for a solution I just can't figure it out. Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3707418/why-are-collections-not-handled-uniformly-in-python#comment3915694_3707535"">@Steven Rumbalski's comment</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/3707535/336527"">@Glenn Maynard's answer</a>, this is not usually a problem because a function that in C++ would have taken an OutputIterator argument, in python would be simply written as a generator.</p>

<p>Normally, I have no problem using generators, and never felt I needed an OutputIterator in Python. However, in this one case, I'm stuck.</p>

<p>I am re-implementing in Python some of the algorithms from the Boost Graph Library. A typical graph traversal algorithm, say <code>depth_first_search</code>, takes as a parameter a ""visitor"" object. The visitor is essentially a bunch of callback functions that the traversal algorithm calls as it encounters different events in its execution (e.g., discovering a new vertex, examining an edge, etc.). In C++, I can have one or several of these callback functions send data to the OutputIterator objects that the visitor object obtained at its initialization from the client code. (For instance, that's precisely how <code>topological_sort</code> is implemented: it takes an OutputIterator, passes it to a <code>dfs_visitor</code> object, the visitor object then ""monitors"" the event <code>finished_vertex</code> and sends the vertexes it receives to the specified OutputIterator. Of course, more complex cases require multiple OutputIterator objects and multiple callback functions.)</p>

<p>How do I achieve the same with Python generators?</p>

<p>I need to somehow send data, in the generator ""style"", from <code>depth_first_search</code> to multiple designated data consumers. I just can't figure out how to do it. (I'm using Python 3.3.)</p>

<p>For starters, IoC is great, and programming to interfaces is the way to go.  But I fail to see where the big benefit lies in the yellow-pages pattern used here, <em>apart from compilation-less reconfigurability</em> .</p>

<p>Application code will use a (Spring) container to retrieve objects from.  Now that's nice: since the code needs to know only the needed interface (to cast to), the Spring container interface, and the name of the needed object, a lot of coupling is removed.</p>

<pre><code>public void foo(){
   ((MyInterface) locator.get(""the/object/I/need"")).callMe();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where, of course, the locator can be populated with a gazillion of objects of all kind of <code>Object</code> derivatives.</p>

<p>But I'm a bit puzzled by the fact that the 'flexibility' of retrieving an object by name actually <strong><em>hides</em> the dependency in a type-unsafe, lookup-unsafe manner</strong>: where my compiler used to check the presence of a requested object member, and it's type, now all of that is postponed to the runtime phase.</p>

<p>The simplest, functionally allright, pattern I could think of is a giant, application wide <code>struct</code> like object:</p>

<pre><code>public class YellowPages  {
    public MyInterface the_object_i_need;
    public YourInterface the_object_you_need;
    ....
}

// context population (no xml... is that bad?)
YellowPages locator = new YellowPages();
locator.the_object_i_need=new MyImpl(""xyx"",true),
locator.the_object_you_need=new YourImpl(1,2,3)


public void foo(){
   locator.the_object_i_need.callMe(); // type-safe, lookup-safe
}
</code></pre>

<p>Would there be a way/pattern/framework to ask the compiler to resolve the requested object, and check whether it's type is ok?  Are there DI frameworks that <em>also</em> do that?</p>

<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Right now I try to test my solution, but I have problem with scrolling.
This is how look my layout:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
xmlns:tools=""http://schemas.android.com/tools""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""400dp""
        tools:context="".Zo""
        android:id=""@+id/zo_root""
&gt;
&lt;ScrollView
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:fillViewport=""true""&gt;
&lt;LinearLayout
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:orientation=""vertical""
    android:weightSum=""9""&gt;
    &lt;FrameLayout
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""0dp""
        android:layout_weight=""3""
        android:background=""@color/Red""
        &gt;&lt;/FrameLayout &gt;
    &lt;FrameLayout
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""0dp""
        android:layout_weight=""3""
        android:background=""@color/Yellow""
        &gt;&lt;/FrameLayout &gt;
    &lt;FrameLayout
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""0dp""
        android:layout_weight=""3""
        android:background=""@color/Blue""
        &gt;&lt;/FrameLayout &gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
&lt;/ScrollView&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>My code behind:</p>

<pre><code>    @Override
    protected void onCreate (Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_zo);
        setParameterForScroolView();   
    }

    private void setParameterForScroolView()
    {
        ParameterKeeper parameterKeeper = new ParameterKeeper(this);
        LinearLayout linearLayout = (LinearLayout)findViewById(R.id.zo_root);
        linearLayout.getLayoutParams().height = parameterKeeper.getHeightOfScreen() *3;       

    }
</code></pre>

<p>The code behind works well, cause my whole screen is red, but I can't scroll it at all.</p>

<p>There was <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4447594/scrollview-dont-scroll"">answer</a> which said, that I need to remove from <code>scrollView</code>   <code>android:fillViewport=""true""</code>. After that my LinearLayout diseapers like in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2599837/linearlayout-not-expanding-inside-a-scrollview/2606641#comment53044069_2606641"">this</a> question.</p>

<p>I added LinearLayout as root (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14811032/scrollview-not-scrolling-at-all"">source</a>) but it not helped me at all.</p>

<p>Have you got any idea to solve it?</p>

<p>I try also set <code>height</code> <code>1600dp</code> instead <code>400dp</code> for Root <code>LinearLayout</code> in <code>xml</code> to be sure, that it's not problem with recalculating <code>view</code>. It's not working too.</p>

my.data$mean.date &lt;- mean(my.data$MY.DATE1, my.data$MY.DATE2, trim = 0.5)
my.data$mean.data &lt;- apply(my.data, 1, function(x) {(x[9] + x[10]) / 2})

<p>Into a page I have this pretty horrible HTML structure:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a title=""WIFI"" href=""javascript: void(0)"" id=""showWifi_${item.index}"" class=""showWifi""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""wifiIcon_${item.index}""  class=""news_box news_box_01 hvr-underline-from-center highLightButton"" style=""margin-right: 50px; border-radius: 25px;""&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the inner div have setted a background immage by CSS (this is pretty horrible because I have a div element inside a link...)</p>

<p>By the way, when the user click on the previous link, it is performed this JQuery script defined into the same page:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $("".showWifi"").click(function(event){

        // Retrieve the id of the clicked element:
        clickedButton = this.id;    
        .............................................
        .............................................
        DO SOMETHING
        .............................................
        .............................................
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so I have restructured the previous HTML structure in this way:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""showWifi"" style=""float: left; margin-right: 40px;""&gt;
    &lt;img src=""&lt;c:url value=""resources/img/icons/projects/wifi.png"" /&gt;""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I have a div that contain an immage.</p>

<p>What I want to do is perform the previous JQuery script when the new div (having <strong>id=""showWifi""</strong>) is clicked but actually the previous script can't work on this element because this div element seems to be not clickable.</p>

<p>How can I solve this issue and perform my script when the div having <strong>id=""showWifi""</strong> is clicked?</p>

the only problem is that while it is edited the name just writes over what was previously there.

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22736668/wpf-validationrule-is-not-being-called"">WPF - ValidationRule is not being called</a></p>

<p>There I was told I should implement <code>INotifyDataErrorInfo</code> and so I did but it still doesn't work.</p>

<p>Here is the xaml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextBlock VerticalAlignment=""Center""&gt;
            &lt;TextBlock.Text&gt;
                &lt;Binding Path=""Path"" Mode=""TwoWay"" UpdateSourceTrigger=""PropertyChanged""&gt;
                    &lt;Binding.ValidationRules&gt;

                    &lt;/Binding.ValidationRules&gt;
                &lt;/Binding&gt;
            &lt;/TextBlock.Text&gt;
        &lt;/TextBlock&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the ViewModel:</p>

<pre><code>private string _path;
    public string Path
    {
        set 
        { 
            _path = value;
            OnPropertyChange(""Path"");
        }
        get { return _path; }
    }

    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;
    private void OnPropertyChange(string propertyName)
    {
        if (PropertyChanged != null)
        {
            PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
        }
    }

    private Dictionary&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt;&gt; errors = new Dictionary&lt;string, List&lt;string&gt;&gt;();
    public event EventHandler&lt;DataErrorsChangedEventArgs&gt; ErrorsChanged;

    private void SetErrors(string propertyName, List&lt;string&gt; propertyErrors)
    {
        // Clear any errors that already exist for this property.
        errors.Remove(propertyName);
        // Add the list collection for the specified property.
        errors.Add(propertyName, propertyErrors);
        // Raise the error-notification event.
        if (ErrorsChanged != null)
            ErrorsChanged(this, new DataErrorsChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
    }
    private void ClearErrors(string propertyName)
    {
        // Remove the error list for this property.
        errors.Remove(propertyName);
        // Raise the error-notification event.
        if (ErrorsChanged != null)
            ErrorsChanged(this, new DataErrorsChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
    }

    public System.Collections.IEnumerable GetErrors(string propertyName)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(propertyName))
        {
            // Provide all the error collections.
            return (errors.Values);
        }
        else
        {
            // Provice the error collection for the requested property
            // (if it has errors).
            if (errors.ContainsKey(propertyName))
            {

            }
            else
            {
                return null;
            }
        }
    }

    public bool HasErrors
    {
        get
        {
            return errors.Count &gt; 0;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And the validation rule:</p>

<pre><code> public class StrRule : ValidationRule
{
    public override ValidationResult Validate(object value, System.Globalization.CultureInfo cultureInfo)
    {
        string filePath = String.Empty;
        filePath = (string)value;
        if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(filePath))
        {
            return new ValidationResult(false, ""Must give a path"");
        }

        if (!File.Exists(filePath))
        {
            return new ValidationResult(false, ""File not found"");
        }
        return new ValidationResult(true, null);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also got a button which opens a FileDialog and then updates the ViewModels' Path property.</p>

<p>When the TextBlock is updated, the binding itself works and the set property is being called, but not the validation rule itself. What is missing/wrong here?</p>

<p>Here is what I am trying to achieve: When I perform a keyword or facet search, I would like to prioritize the results which match id's from my array. The array is unique to each user therefore it is not something I can index as a field and do a simple order_by(), as I would have to have on index per user.</p>

<p>My first thought was to perform the search using the search_ids() method, which only returns the id's of the records (much faster that a plain search()) and then re-order the search results based on the values in my array, then fetch the records straight from the DB (since I already have the exact id's). With this solution I would have to bump the pagination on the solr search to a very high number (at least the size of the array). This can start to slow things down.</p>

<p>Another issue with this solution is pagination. I would have to store the results Id's as well as my array in memory somewhere in between requests in order to maintain order during pagination. This would require me to handle pagination on my own. </p>

<p>Another possible solution would be to store the array of ids in each specific user's index entry. When a search is performed I can look at each result and prioritize those that have my id in their indexed fields. Not sure this would even work. </p>

<p>Any ideas are greatly appreciated. This is a rails app using solr 3.3 and sunspot 1.2.</p>

<p>The only object which receives a reference to <code>FHwnd</code> is a private custom TThread (created within this class) and the only message it posts is <code>TH_MYMESSAGE</code>.  My understanding is that the <code>message</code> directive in the procedure declaration restricts its handling to only <code>TH_MYMESSAGE</code>.</p>

<p>This was working fine in testing, but upon integration into a much larger application I am getting feedback that <code>HandleMyMessage</code> is firing for other messages as well (with obvious undesired results).</p>

<p>This was easily corrected by adding <code>if Message.Msg &lt;&gt; TH_MYMESSAGE then Exit;</code> in <code>HandleMyMessage</code>.  My question is :  Why is this happening?  </p>

<p>My best guess is that <code>AllocateHWND</code> has made <code>HandleMyMessage</code> the equivalent of a <code>DefWndProc</code> despite it having the <code>message</code> directive.  Is there a correct way to implement this which I'm missing?</p>

I've managed to speed this up quite substantially using a gpuArray and then running the exp call on a Quadro 4000 graphics card however this then prevents the parfor loop from being used, since the workstation has only one graphics card, which obliterates any gains.

Not only I need to send requests to the remote server, but also I wish to listen for the incoming data from the socket. The RoboSpice wiki &amp; sample showcased how to send a request, but how to leverage the framework to handle incoming data and do something upon the delivery of incoming data? </p>

<p>@Snicolas, Thank you for the good work. Could you please give me some hints? Thank you.</p>

<p>i am trying to parse some JSON, i currently got everything parsed on a single page, but its too much information to put on one page i want to be able to filter through it by listing the parent objects ""church"" and then once a parent is clicked i'd like the child (nested) objects ""tracks"" to be listed (basically to filter through the JSON), (think of your iPod you click on a Artist(which is the ""church"") then a album (which is ""album) then a track (which is ""tracks"" in the json)</p>

<p><strong>so how do i make a parent object a link that parses the next level of JSON?</strong></p>

<p>you can visit <a href=""http://ggcc.tv/JSON_Parsers/Music.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ggcc.tv/JSON_Parsers/Music.php</a> to see what i have so far</p>

<p>please help, thank you.</p>

<pre><code>    $count = 0;
    foreach ($json['rows'] as $row) {
        ++$count;

        echo ""&lt;h1&gt;Row: {$count}&lt;/h1&gt;"";
        echo ""Album: {$row[doc]['album']}&lt;br /&gt;"";

However, since <code>HandleSecurityAttribute</code> is not an authorization filter, all logic to handle <code>DenyAnonymousAccessPolicyViolation</code> only get executed after authorization filter, such as <code>ValidateAntiForgeryToken</code>.</p>

<p>This means that if current user's authentication ticket is timeout, any action decorated with <code>ValidateAntiForgeryToken</code> will throw exception since the token is not created for anonymous user.</p>

<p>So is there a way to work around this? I am currently looking at two solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>reate my own authorization filter to perform exact what <code>HandleSecurityAttribute</code> security does. </li>
<li>Use the global <code>Authorize</code> filer to handle authentication and leave role / other access policy to FluentSecurity.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I checked in a demo at github, the username and password for this is dev1 and devdev. I set the timeout forms authentication to 1 minute. So if you login, and wait for one minute, then click on logoff, you will get the token is not created for anonymous user. In normal MVC, this won't happen since [Authorize] runs before [ValidateAntiForgeryToken], which redirect user back to login screen.</p>

<p>I have no problem verifying that the rows in a DataTable are actually sorted, but I also want to verify that each sort column has at least one grouping with more than one distinct value.</p>

<p>I am maintaining a list of integers that define the sorted columns (negative integers indicate a descending sort order - and the absolute value of the integer is the column number).  </p>

<p>Let me clarify.</p>

<p>I am writing a unit test condition that verifies a sorted DataTable.  I can verify that the row are in the correct sorted order, but I want to verify that the result set contains data that actually tests the sort.  In order words, a result set with only one row or any number of duplicate rows is indeed sorted, but that doesn't actually test the sort.</p>

<p>I need to verify that each level of the sort contains at least two distinct values in at least one grouping.</p>

<p>In the past I used a combination of SQL and .Net code and used the following set of queries to make sure there was enough data to test the sort.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT TOP 1 COUNT(DISTINCT column1) 
FROM table 
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT column1) &gt; 1

SELECT TOP 1 column1, COUNT(DISTINCT column2) 
FROM table 
GROUP BY column1 
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT column2) &gt; 1

SELECT TOP 1 column1, column2, COUNT(DISTINCT column3)
FROM table
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT column3) &gt; 1
</code></pre>

<p>Where I have a query for each level and all queries must return a non-empty result set in order for the unit test to pass.</p>

<p>My real question is how do I duplicate/convert the SQL code above to LINQ?</p>

<p>I have the following in my <strong>View</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>@using MvcCheckBoxList.Model
@model Web.Models.RegistrationViewModel

 &lt;div&gt;
    @Html.Label(""Check at least one box:"")
    &lt;br /&gt;
                      @Html.CheckBoxListFor(model=&gt;model.agentTypeViewModel.PostedAgentTypes.AgentTypeId,
                          model=&gt;model.agentTypeViewModel.AvailableAgentTypes,

                          Position.Horizontal)
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works just fine; I'm able to see 4 check boxes and when checked it will identify them for me via the index of that check box.</p>

<p>I just wish to add some JQuery validation in order to display an error if the user does not choose any one of these check boxes.</p>

<p>I can add an <code>id</code> but I'm assuming this will add the same <code>id</code> to all 4 check boxes that get generated in the view. So I see that as a problem:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.CheckBoxListFor(model=&gt;model.agentTypeViewModel.PostedAgentTypes.AgentTypeId,
                  model=&gt;model.agentTypeViewModel.AvailableAgentTypes,
                  agent=&gt;agent.Id,
                  agent=&gt;agent.Name,
                  model=&gt;model.agentTypeViewModel.SelectedAgentTypes,
                  Position.Horizontal,
                  x=&gt; new {id=""agentTypesCheckboxes""}
                  )
</code></pre>

<p>My question here is, would it be possible to just do some server side validation on this via <code>DataAnnotations</code> to make sure at least one is checked? Or would it be recommended to do this via jQuery (as am trying to do now), how can it be done?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong></p>

<p>I've added the following code but no success, I click on one of the checkboxs, uncheck it and it shows no errors. Even after submitting the form, still no validation warnings on the checkboxes.</p>

<pre><code>   $(document).ready(function () {
        $('#btnSubmit').click(function(obj) {
            var isValid = $(""#RegistrationForm"").valid();
            if (isValid) {
                obj.preventDefault();
                $('#RegistrationForm').submit();
                return false;
            }
        });

        $.validator.addMethod(""chkGroupSelection"", function () {
            return ($('#divChkGroup input[type=""checkbox""]:checked').length != 0);
        }, ""Checkbox not selected."");

        $('#RegistrationForm').validate({
            rules: {
                divChkGroup: { chkGroupSelection: true }
            },
            messages: {
                divChkGroup: ""Must check one""
            },
            errorPlacement: function (error, element) {
                error.appendTo(element.parent().next());
            }
        });

    });
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>Also probably worth noting, this is what the actual html looks like for one of the checkboxes I'm referring to.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id=""agentTypeViewModel_PostedAgentTypes_AgentTypeId4"" type=""checkbox"" value=""5"" name=""agentTypeViewModel.PostedAgentTypes.AgentTypeId""&gt;
&lt;label for=""agentTypeViewModel_PostedAgentTypes_AgentTypeId4""&gt;Item 5&lt;/label&gt;

<p>Based on my knowledge of Orbited(which is limited since it seems like the site is down, so I've just been going off of blog posts and whatnot), there are channels that basically anyone can subscribe to and get the messages sent to it. Since the subscribing is done through Javascript, it would be easy for someone to just change what channel they're subscribed to and subscribe to someone else's private chat and see what they're saying.</p>

<p>So how would you get around this and have some kind of authentication in Orbited's channels? I've been looking around and most people cite Hotdot as an example, but it's not extremely documented so it's hard to understand. It also seems like it just checks for authentication before allowing you to subscribe to anything, but once you're logged in you'd still be able to subscribe to any channel you want.</p>

<ul>
<li>AccountingPlugin</li>
<li>UiPlugin</li>
<li>Etc....</li>
</ul>

<p>So like now I have all the UI related stuff inside UiPlugin and I am working on Accounting plugin and I have controllers, services and views of all domains in this plugin only.</p>

<p>I am using <a href=""https://grails.github.io/grails-doc/latest/ref/Tags/resource.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Resource tag</a> to get all CSS and JS from the UI plugin and have to use it inside the Accounting plugin like-</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""${resource(dir: 'assets/css', file: ""datepicker.css"")}""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which generates <code>http://localhost:8080/PROJECT_NAME/plugins/accountancy-plugin-0.1/assets/css/datepicker.css</code></p>

<p>but the file is located at- <code>http://localhost:8080/PROJECT_NAME/plugins/ui-plugin-0.1/assets/css/datepicker.css</code></p>

<p>So the problem is that it is looking inside its own resources. How can I make this resource tag to look for resources in a separate(UI) plugin for resources?</p>

<p>Please note: The business logic has been separated from UI and hence we have multiple plugins and a separate UI plugin which is used by all plugins for getting UI and theme. So they cannot be in same plugin.</p>

<pre><code>public class Student
{
    public bool IsGood { get; set; }
    public StudentType St { get; set; }
    public University University { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can dynamically load the object from assembly by doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>var assembly = Assembly.LoadFrom(""//path"");

Type type = assembly.GetType(""TestFrameWork.Student"");
var student = Activator.CreateInstance(type); 
</code></pre>

<p>It fails on following code:</p>

<p>student.IsGood = true;<br>
        student.St = TestFrameWork.StudentType.SomethingElse;</p>

<p>Student Type is an Enum from dynamically loaded assembly;</p>

<p>I can get the student object. Now is the interesting part. I can call it's methods. I can get all its properties. I can set it's primitive properties </p>

<p>So I can pretty much do student.IsGood = true; and it will set that property. That is equally true if I had other primitive properties of type int, float etc. </p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>When I try to set it to a property which is native to dynamically loaded assembly It fails with RuntimeBinderException</p>

<p>So for example,</p>

<p>if I try to do  student.University = new University() where University is a native type of loaded assembly. It fails. </p>

<p>Now I've seen this warning before when trying to use 'self' in a block (and am guessing both problems are related?).  Usually to silence these warnings you declare variables outside of the block or queue with __block or __weak.  Then you can read from those variables in the block or assign a value to them and retrieve the value assigned inside of the block from outside of the block.  So instead of just using self or self.player in one of my classes I would do this:</p>

<pre><code>__weak FancyViewController *weakSelf = self;
__block Player *blockPlayer = self.player;

<p>and use weakSelf and blockPlayer inside of the block to get rid of the errors.</p>

<li>Waiting for keyboard input or other kind of human interaction</li>

<p>I'm using the following command line to run the build:</p>

<p>If I use /M4 in the command line instead of /M12, the build goes much faster, and I receive this as the starting output:</p>

<pre><code>5) Build started: Project: Project5, Configuration: Release

2) Build started: Project: Project2, Configuration: Release

<p>The advantage of Parameterized SQL for Strings, Dates, and floating-point numbers is very obvious and indisputable.</p>

<p>My question is: what about <code>int</code>s?</p>

<p>I ask because, oftentimes, if I'm writing a query or update and the only parameter is an <code>int</code>, I'll just write an inline sql and append the int as a shortcut (<code>""select * from table where id = "" + id</code>).</p>

<p>My question: <strong>Are there any advantages to using Parameterized SQL for <code>int</code>s alone?</strong></p>

<p>To illustrate with Java:</p>

<p>Are there any advantage to this:</p>

int id;
String sql = ""select * from table where id = ?"";
try (PreparedStatement p_stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    p_stmt.setInt(1, id);

"6157426","1","6157475","","2011-05-27 20:35:07","","2","781","<p>I've written an app which processes a lot of data on startup; first startup time of the app is rather slow, but so are subsequent launches.</p>

<p>I previously thought that the relatively un-responsive startup times (~7 seconds) were due to data processing on first load - a bit of debugging suggested about 2 seconds to cold-load. So I redesigned my data structures so they're easier to serialize to persistent storage in between launches (so it caches stuff) and it now saves state when the app finishes in about 20ms, and loading time is about 10-20ms. Much better. (p.s. it's not using the built-in Java serialization, as the state files are now so simple it's easier to save in a plain, human-readable (and editable) text file - it's still pretty quick at reloading from this though!)</p>

<p>However, I'm still finding that the app startup time is about 5 seconds - I've looked in aLogCat which has an entry:</p>

<pre><code>I/ActivityManager(...) blah blah blah: +5s193ms
</code></pre>

<p>So more than 5 seconds to load a relatively simple layout (a few nested LinearLayouts, and a few TextViews - nothing special, and no images) - admittedly that time goes down with subsequent launches (I close the app and open it again, it's ~700ms; rinse and repeat for similar results).</p>

<p>Soooo my question is: how can I improve the app loading times? I'm happy that <em>first</em> load takes a little while to process everything - that's fine. But is there a way I can keep the thing in memory, or at least get it into a restorable state so whatever ActivityManager is doing doesn't take so long? I'd like it to be something I can open (probably bound to long-hold search or similar), do whatever, and close it again - thus it needs to open quickly!</p>

<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

Which of the following is better approach?</p>

<pre><code>String countStr;
int count;
try {
count = Integer.parseInt(countStr);
} catch (Exception e) {
//return as the variable is not a proper integer.

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>String integerRegex = ""([0-9]{0,9})"";
if (countStr.isEmpty() || !Pattern.matches(integerRegex, countStr)) {
//return as the variable is not a proper integer.
return;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: My question here is, Is  doing an Integer.parseInt() and catching an exception for validation a standard way to validate an 'int'? I admit that my regex is not perfect. But is there any inbuilt methods available in java for validation of int? Actually isn't it better to do some validation instead of simply catching the exception?</p>

this function nest a ticker in my principal page index from another page called ticker.
cakephp path used are like that SessionModels/ticker.ctp and SessionModels/index.ctp.</p>

<p>when I run my page <code>ticker.ctp</code> alone, it runs without a problem displaying a ticker but when I have tried to nest it in a <code>&lt;div id=""ticker""&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code> with my jquery function in <code>index.ctp</code>, it doesn't do anything .
this is my javascript/ jquery function :</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" &gt; function ticker(){

    $.ajax ({
        type:'GET',
        url:'/SessionModels/ticker/',
        success:function(e){

        complete : function(e){
            setTimeout (""ticker()"", 3000);
        }
    });

}

$(document).ready(function(){
ticker();
});&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have added as I have seen also in cakephp tutorial this code in my controller</p>

<pre><code>public $helpers = array('Js');

<p>this is the content of my ticker.ctp</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;marquee &gt;

        &lt;?php echo $session['SessionModel']['_close']; ?&gt;

&lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt;

<p>and this is the content of my controller:</p>

<pre><code>    class SessionModelsController extends Controller {

    public $helpers = array('Js');
    public $components = array('RequestHandler');

    public function index() {
        $this-&gt;set('sessions', $this-&gt;SessionModel-&gt;find('all', array('contain' =&gt; 'Dictionnary.stock_name')));

    }
    public function ticker() {
        $this-&gt;set('sessions', $this-&gt;SessionModel-&gt;find('all', array('contain' =&gt; 'Dictionnary.ticker')));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>as I have said , it works perfectly without a problem but nesting the ticker.ctp in index.ctp is the problem.

<p>Lots of people building DSLs are unable to provide a reasoned answer to ""why are you building a DSL?"" and ""why would a DSL help you more than a well-factored object model?""</p>

<p>I hear a lot of ""I'm doing it because it's cool and everybody else is doing it"" - which is not a rational answer.</p>

<p>I believe that DSLs are helpful at least some of the time but that they're not likely to be a ""silver bullet"" that should be used indiscriminately. I would like to see some scientific work that describes when DSLs should and should not be used - based on empirical research.</p>

<p>I believe that this code results in double dereferencing when the vector elements are accessed, because the CPU should first dereference <code>v</code> to read the pointer to the first element, which pointer needs to be dereferenced again to read the first element. I would expect that it would be more efficient to pass a shallow copy of the vector object on the stack. Such shallow copy would encapsulate a pointer to the first element, and the size, with the pointer referencing the same memory area as the original vector does.</p>

<p>Similar performance, but much less convenience could be achieved by passing a random access iterator pair. <em>My question is: what is flawed with this idea?</em> I expect that there should be some good reason that smart people accept to pay the performace cost of vector reference, or deal with the inconvenience of iterators.</p>

<p>Edit: Based on the coments below, please consider the situation if I simply rename the suggested <code>vector_ref</code> class to <em>slice</em> or <em>range</em>. The intention is to use random-access iterator pairs with more natural syntax.</p>

<p>When I remove the STORE command everything works perfectly fine. But Storing the result to the BLOB is a pain in the arse. It say in the error log: ""AS was unexpected at this time"". But if I remove the schema and define the column with $0 it says: B was unexpected at this time.</p>

<p>The following Code prints out: Dump unexpected at this time.</p>

<pre><code>string queryString = "" A = LOAD 'wasb:///PigTestFolder/wordlist.txt' USING PigStorage();"" +
                                 "" Dump A;"" +
                                 "" STORE A INTO 'wasb:///PigTestFolder/results/' USING PigStorage ('\t');"";
</code></pre>

<p>I tested the code with the Hortonworks Sandbox and it works. No problem. Another mystery is, when using only the following two lines of PigLatin code it works as well:</p>

<pre><code>string queryString = "" A = LOAD 'wasb:///PigTestFolder/wordlist.txt' USING PigStorage();"" +

""STORE D INTO 'wasb:///PigTestFolder/results/' USING PigStorage ('\t');"";

<p>Does anyone have any idea what I am doing wrong?</p>

This Sql Server database will be used with a new version of our application in development.</p>

<p>I've been writing migrating code in C# that calls Sql Server and Access and transforms the data as required.  I migrated for the first time a table which has entries related to new entries of another table that I have not updated recently, and that caused an error because the record in the corresponding table in SQL Server could not be found</p>

<p>So, my SqlServer productions table has data only up to 1/14/09, and I'm continuing to  migrate more tables from Access. So I want to write an update method that can figure out what the new stuff is in Access that hasn't been reflected in Sql Server.</p>

<p>My current idea is to write a query on the SQL side which does SELECT Max(RunDate) FROM ProductionRuns, to give me the latest date in that field in the table. On the Access side, I would write a query that does SELECT * FROM ProductionRuns WHERE RunDate > ?, where the parameter is that max date found in SQL Server, and perform my translation step in code, and then insert the new data in Sql Server. </p>

<p>What I'm wondering is, do I have the syntax right for getting the latest date in that Sql Server table? And is there a better way to do this kind of migration of a live database?</p>

<p>Edit: What I've done is make a copy of the current live database. Which I can then migrate without worrying about changes, then use that to test during development, and then I can migrate the latest data whenever the new database and application go live.</p>

I have an app written using a number of MediaElements. I've written it in both WinRT (C#) and WPF and seen the same behavior. Regardless, it basically is one page of video thumbnails on repeat navigating to a second page with the video. It works great for a while.</p>

<p>But after a while (i.e., lot's of debug-stop-debug), one video thumbnail will not load...just get a green screen. Then another. Then another. And then finally all of the videos stop displaying, though they will still be playing, as I can hear the audio on the ""big"" video page.</p>

<p>Interestingly, at that point, WMP and most every other video app (even browsers) stops showing video, as well. VLC DOES play correctly, though. I point this out because I assume what is likely happening is that I'm somehow exhausting a limited number of ""video renderer handles"" (dunno) from DirectShow or some layer just below that which VLC bypasses.</p>

<p>I've gone to great lengths to make sure all streams are closed and disposed and such whenever they end, but obviously either there's a bug in the MediaElement or I'm missing some opportunity to close a handle or dispose of something directly related to the rendering engine. This happens on multiple PC's and (with the WPF version) happened both on Win7 and Win8.1. Have to reboot to clear it up. Any ideas on where to start sleuthing?</p>

<p><b>Edit:</b></p>

<p>I'm playing local files. Binding the source to a Uri in .Net and setting it to an open IRandomAccessStream in code in WinRT. Same behavior in both scenarios.</p>

<a href=""https://github.com/nervgh/angular-file-upload"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nervgh/angular-file-upload</a></p>

<p>It is working like a charm when I hard code the <code>preOpKey</code>.  What I would like to do is to send the <code>preOpKey</code> along with the file so that I can save the file to the appropriate record in the database.</p>

<p>angular-file-upload has a <code>fileData</code> in the API which I'm populating in <code>$scope.OnPreinspectionSubmit()</code> but for some reason I can't find that value once <code>SaveFile()</code> in my MVC controller is called.</p>

<p>I just need to know how to pass a value along with my file and then access it in my MVC controller.  I guess it would be convenient to send it in the <code>fileData</code> but that isn't required to answer my question.</p>

<p>Here is my Angular controller:</p>

<pre><code>var OperatorPreinspectionControllers = angular.module('OperatorPreinspectionControllers', ['angularFileUpload']);

OperatorPreinspectionControllers.controller('OperatorPreinspectionCtrl', ['$scope', '$http', 'FileUploader',
    function ($scope, $http, FileUploader) {

        $scope.uploader = new FileUploader({
            url: pageBaseUrl + 'image/SaveFile'
        });

        $scope.uploader.filters.push({
            name: 'imageFilter',
            fn: function (item /*{File|FileLikeObject}*/, options) {
                var type = '|' + item.type.slice(item.type.lastIndexOf('/') + 1) + '|';
                return '|jpg|png|jpeg|bmp|gif|pdf|'.indexOf(type) !== -1;
            }
        });

        // Send the form data to the database
        $scope.OnPreinspectionSubmit = function () {
            if (confirm(""Are you sure you want to save this information?"")) {
                $http.post(pageBaseUrl + 'api/PreInspectionForm', $scope.formInformation).success(function (returnData) {
                    $scope.uploader.formData.push({ preOpKey: returnData });
                    $scope.uploader.uploadAll(); // Upload file
                });
            } else { }
        }
    }
]);
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my MVC Controller:</p>

<pre><code>public void SaveFile()
    {
        HttpFileCollectionBase files = Request.Files;
        HttpPostedFileBase uploadedFile = files[0];

        var preOpKey = 123; // ???????

        // Turn the file into bytes
        byte[] data;
        using(Stream inputStream = uploadedFile.InputStream)
        {
            MemoryStream memoryStream = inputStream as MemoryStream;
            if(memoryStream == null)
            {
                memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
                inputStream.CopyTo(memoryStream);
            }
            data = memoryStream.ToArray();
        }

        PreOpManager.SaveImage(preOpKey, data, uploadedFile.FileName, uploadedFile.ContentType);
    }

<p>Does it means that I have registered the redirect URI properly?</p>

<p>Q3. In the error, I keep on getting <code>The redirect URI in the request: http://myportal.com/session/oauth2callback.cfm did not match a registered redirect URI</code> I don't know from where <code>outh2callback.cfm</code> is getting added over there as I have already removed <code>out2callback</code> thing from the end of <code>REDIRECT URIS</code> section as clear from the image above. </p>

This works fine for a while, the application uses Jetty to run but I quickly run out of file handles. I first thought, there was something seriously broken in the environment since I suddenly got <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code>s. However, I then found that the <code>ClassLoader</code> in the JDK actually throws this exception when it tries to load a class but cannot get a handle on the <em>.class</em> file that contains the class's data. I thus thought that the application had a handle leak which I tried to debug. The managed environment is quite restrictive on the number of concurrent handles.</p>

<p>When trying to debug this, I found that it is indeed the JVM itself that keeps these handles open. Jetty saves the dependencies of the application (with the transitive dependencies of only Spring, those are quite a lot) on the file system something like this</p>

<pre><code>...temp/Jetty_0_0_0_0_8080_myapp.war_spring_something.jar
</code></pre>

<p>where the JVM keeps an open file handle to this dependency and others. This way, the JVM keeps about 50 open handles what is too much when I add the handles that the application itself requires (web sockets, database, files).</p>

<p>Before I even begin to discuss the configuration of the precious service bus, I wanted to know if this is:</p>

<ul>
<li>normal</li>
<li>avoidable</li>
</ul>

<p>I personally find that the JVM should close such handles once it does not actively load classes. I suspect however that this is some optimization technique, in order to avoid constant opening of the jar files.</p>

<p>Since I was schooled only in compiled languages programming I may not fully understand the dynamics of interpreted / JIT compiled languages: When using apache's PHP module, is each instruction compiled and then executed (like it happens in the CLI, for example), or is the whole script JIT compiled and then executed?</p>

<p>In case it's per instruction compiling/executing, should I have a block of <code>require_once</code> at the beginning of the file (which seems way more sane to me) or would it be more efficient to include them only if I need them (inside <code>if</code> blocks and so...)?</p>

<p>In models.py, I have:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models
import datetime
from django.utils import timezone

class Cap(models.Model):

    title = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    user_id = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    dest_id = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    cap_id = models.CharField(max_length=500)

    text_part = models.FileField(upload_to='texts/%Y/%m/%d')

    time_to_live = models.IntegerField()
    pub_date = models.DateField()

    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.title
</code></pre>

<p>Then in forms.py, I have:</p>

<pre><code>from django.forms import ModelForm

from latercap.models import Capsule

class CapForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Cap
        fields = '__all__'
</code></pre>

<p>Then in views.py, I have:</p>

<pre><code>from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from myapp.forms import CapForm

def upload(request):
    # Handle file upload
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = CapForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
        if form.is_vaild():
            form.save()
            # Redirect to the upload page after POST
            return HttpResponseRedirect('/myapp/upload/')
    else:
        form = CapForm() # An empty, unbound form

    message = ""You can upload your message here!""
    context = {'message': message, 'form': form}

    # Render upload page with the documents and the form
    return render(request, 'myapp/upload.html', context)
</code></pre>

<p>Then in upload.html, I have:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;b&gt;{{message}}&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;form action=""{% url 'myapp:upload' %}"" method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data""&gt;
    {% csrf_token %}
    &lt;p&gt;{{ form.non_field_errors }}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Title: {{ form.title }}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: {{ form.user_id }}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To: {{ form.dest_id }}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. {{ form.cap_id }}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open after: {{ form.time_to_live }}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publish date: {{ form.pub_date }}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My message:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
       {{ form.text_part }}
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Upload"" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I set correct values into the form and click ""Upload"" button, I ALWAYS get:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; AttributeError at /myapp/upload/ 'CapForm' object has no attribute
&gt; 'is_vaild'
&gt; Request Method:   POST Request

&gt; Django Version:   1.6.5
&gt; Exception Type:   AttributeError Exception Value:  'CapForm' object
&gt; has no attribute 'is_vaild'
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>print form.errors</code>, but nothing was shown</li>
<li><code>print form.is_valid()</code> before the <code>if</code>, still gives the error</li>
<li>delete the <code>text_part</code> and only pass <code>request.POST</code> to the <code>form</code>, still gives errors</li>
<li>use <code>form(data=request.POST, files=request.FILES)</code>, still errors</li>
<li><code>print form.is_multipart()</code> give me a <code>True</code> result</li>
<li>submit an empty or correctly filled form all give the same error</li>
</ul>

<p>What should I do to get this work? Many many thanks!</p>

Right now I have placed the ""default.json"" file in a local directory that can be accessed by Xcode and iPhone 6.1 Simulator.</p>

<p>My simple app runs like a charm.</p>

<p>I can easily access the JSON file using the following declarations:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);
NSString *documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0];
NSString *jsonPath = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""default.json""];
NSString *jsonString = [[NSString alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:jsonPath encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:NULL];
</code></pre>

<p>The local path to the json file is:
<strong><em>/Users/kamil/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/6.1/Applications/CE00BA77-1CAD-4336-8A83-C95341CDF4AA/Documents/default.json</em></strong></p>

<p>Now, when I try to lunch my app on iPhone, my app crashes. Very quick inspection of the debugger log demonstrates there might be a problem with the access to the file on iPhone.</p>

<p>How can I store and access my defaul.json file from within an app running natively on iPhone?</p>

However, i'm struggling to find a fit programming language for this.   </p>

<p>The <strong>displaying part</strong> shouldn't be too hard and can probably be done in most of the programming languages.   The <strong>audio part</strong> is what concerns me the most since it's not the main focus of the project and should only do limited things (so it shouldn't be too hard) and i do not know anything about sound support in the programming languages i currently know. (Java, C and C++)</p>

<p>Specifically i would like to be able to do these things:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Play</em> a sound file</li>
<li><em>Stop/pause</em> a playing song</li>
<li>Adjust <em>volume</em></li>
<li>Show a bar that displays the <em>current position</em> in the song</li>
</ol>

<p>Most files will be <strong>.mp3</strong> files but being able to process other formats is certainly a plus. Since this is just a small project it's ok if it runs just on <strong>Windows</strong>. Scalabilty would be nice but not required.</p>

<p>It would be nice to have a small overview of audio support/audio libraries of programming languages (i'm always up for something new) that can accomplish these simple things, in a not too complicated way, aswell as personal experiences. </p>

<p>In this way i hope to create a better understanding of which programming language fits my project best. (i would very much like to not have to change language mid-way the project)</p>

<p>--</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:
This is only for a later stage of the project if the first part was successfull: i will want to change the file names of the audio files that are displayed. (to make them follow a specific format)</p>

I get linking errors for multiple definitions for symbols in libgmp (___gmpz_abs), for example, among countless others).  I have in turn traced this back to libgnutls.a having multiple definitions of the same symbol, due to object files in <em>gnutls</em> each having their own definitions of <em>gmp</em> functions.  The functions that are multiply defined are ones that libgmp is trying to do something tricky with inlining.</p>

<p>There's a lot of variation with inlining between different compilers, standards, and platforms, from what I can tell.  It seems like libgmp is trying to use macros to handle this all properly but is failing.  The end result is inline functions defined in gmp.h are getting copied into every object file in gnutls that uses it.  I've looked at the actual compiler command lines that mingw is called with to create these object files, and I can't see anything wrong with it:</p>

<pre><code>libtool: compile:  i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -std=gnu99 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../.. -I./../../gl -I./../../gl -I./../includes -I./../includes -I./../../gl -I./.. -I./../minitasn1 -I/home/jeremy/vlc/contrib/i686-w64-mingw32/include -I/home/jeremy/vlc/contrib/i686-w64-mingw32/include -g -c mpi.c -o mpi.o

<p>in particular -std=gnu99 was suggested as a solution to similar problems elsewhere online, but obviously this is already being used by default.  </p>

<p>It's unclear whose fault this is, mingw's libtool's gnutls's or gmp's</p>

<p>For example, I have a databases with a table called ""Version"" (version number is being stored there). But database can be accessed and edited by developers without changing version number. If for example developer updates stored procedure and does not update Version database state is not in sync with version value.</p>

<p>How to track those changes? I do not need to track what is changed but only need to check if database tables, views, procedures, etc. are in sync with database version that is saved in Version table. </p>

<p>Why I need this? When doing deployment I need to check that database is ""correct"". Also, not all tables or other database objects should be tracked. Is it possible to check without using triggers? Is it possible to be done without 3rd party tools? Do databases have checksums?</p>

<p>Lets say that we use SQL Server 2005.</p>

<p>Edited:</p>

<p>I think I should provide a bit more information about our current environment - we have a ""baseline"" with all scripts needed to create base version (includes data objects and ""metadata"" for our app). However, there are many installations of this ""base"" version with some additional database objects (additional tables, views, procedures, etc.). When we make some change in ""base"" version we also have to update some installations (not all) - at that time we have to check that ""base"" is in correct state.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

The problem is that I can not get the changed values of the form  to ModelAttribute.
For example: i have object User{id: 1, username: ""user"", pass: ""111""} in my database, when i try to modify it into form end post changes(User{id: 1, username: ""user_changed"", pass: ""222""}) to controller, i receive the persistent User(without changes)</p>

<p><code>@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public ModelAndView create(@ModelAttribute(""user"") @Valid User user,
                               BindingResult bindingResultUser,
                               ModelAndView model,
                               WebRequest webRequest,
                               Locale locale) {...}
</code></p>

<p>After some time spent debugging,  i find the reason of such converter behavior.</p>

<p>first starts from this row when ModelAttributeMethodProcessor try to convert bound user object to ModelAttribute: <strong>return binder.convertIfNecessary(binder.getTarget(), parameter.getParameterType(), parameter);</strong></p>

<p>`
@Override
    public final Object resolveArgument(MethodParameter parameter, ModelAndViewContainer mavContainer,
            NativeWebRequest webRequest, WebDataBinderFactory binderFactory) throws Exception {</p>

<pre><code>    String name = ModelFactory.getNameForParameter(parameter);
    Object attribute = (mavContainer.containsAttribute(name) ?
            mavContainer.getModel().get(name) : createAttribute(name, parameter, binderFactory, webRequest));

    WebDataBinder binder = binderFactory.createBinder(webRequest, attribute, name);
    if (binder.getTarget() != null) {
        bindRequestParameters(binder, webRequest);
        validateIfApplicable(binder, parameter);
        if (binder.getBindingResult().hasErrors() &amp;&amp; isBindExceptionRequired(binder, parameter)) {
            throw new BindException(binder.getBindingResult());
        }
    }

    // Add resolved attribute and BindingResult at the end of the model
    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; bindingResultModel = binder.getBindingResult().getModel();
    mavContainer.removeAttributes(bindingResultModel);
    mavContainer.addAllAttributes(bindingResultModel);

    return binder.convertIfNecessary(binder.getTarget(), parameter.getParameterType(), parameter);
}
</code></pre>

<p>`</p>

<p>Then, DataBinder-> invoke the ConversionService->DomainClassConverter to convert User object to convert it into ModelAttribute.
DomainConverter first converts User->Id, then back in User, at this moment User is re-reading from the database and lost all modified assignments that DataBinder made.</p>

<p>I solve this problem when i replaced this row ~~if (sourceType.equals(targetType)) {~~ to <strong>if (sourceType.getType() != null &amp;&amp; sourceType.getType().equals(targetType.getType())) {</strong></p>

<p>`
        @Override
        public Object convert(Object source, TypeDescriptor sourceType, TypeDescriptor targetType) {</p>

<pre><code>        if (source == null || !StringUtils.hasText(source.toString())) {
            return null;
        }

        if (sourceType.equals(targetType)) {
            return source;
        }

        Class&lt;?&gt; domainType = sourceType.getType();

        EntityInformation&lt;Object, ?&gt; entityInformation = repositories.getEntityInformationFor(domainType);

        return conversionService.convert(entityInformation.getId(source), targetType.getType());
    }

<p>in theory we have to compare types but TypeDescriptors. Or I was wrong?</p>

<p>My problem is that I want to check for the earliest date that is the table. So if there are 2 cards one which was 01/04/2013 and 04/05/2013 I want to recognise that 01/04/2013 is the earlier date and return that row. </p>

<p>So far I have come up with 2 solutions:</p>

<p><strong>Multiple queries to the DB</strong></p>

<p>I have been able to implement a successful solution that will iterate through the database and decrease a date object by 1 which is then used as a string to match the date. The issue is that the database may need to be queried 100 times before it finds the earliest date. Is it bad practice to do it this way?</p>

<p><strong>Iterative through the result set</strong></p>

<p>Another possibility is to iterate through a result set of all the flashcards in the table. However, this would involve 2 loops, one to iterate over each row in the table which would be inside a loop that would decrease the date by 1.</p>

<p>I feel that both of these are not great solutions. I wonder if someone could help me achieve this in a more efficient manner?</p>

"12496817","1","12749822","","2012-09-19 14:25:16","","6","276","<p>One problem I am struggling with while writing a C++ extension for Ruby is to make it really safe even if the user does silly things. He should get exceptions then, but never a SegFault. A concrete problem is the following: My C++ class has a non-trivial constructor. Then I use the Rice API to wrap my C++ class. If the user redefines initialize() in his Ruby code, then the initialize() function created by Rice is overwritten and the object is neither allocated nor initialized. One toy example could be the following:</p>

<pre><code>class Person {
public:
  Person(const string&amp; name): m_name (name) {}
  const string&amp; name() const { return m_name; }
private:
  string m_name;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I create the Ruby class like this:</p>

<pre><code>define_class&lt;Person&gt;(""Person"")
  .define_constructor(Constructor&lt;Person, const string&amp;&gt;(), Arg(""name""))
  .define_method(""name"", &amp;Person::name);
</code></pre>

<p>Then the following Ruby Code causes a Segfault</p>

<pre><code>require 'MyExtension'
class Person
  def initialize
  end
end
p = Person.new
puts p.name
</code></pre>

<p>There would be two possibilities I would be happy about: Forbid overwriting the initialize function in Ruby somehow or check in C++, if the Object has been allocated correctly and if not, throw an exception.</p>

<p>I once used the Ruby C API directly and then it was easy. I just allocated a dummy object consisting of a Null Pointer and a flag that is set to false in the allocate() function and in the initialize method, I allocated the real object and set the flag to true. In every method, I checked for that flag and raised an exception, if it was false. However, I wrote a lot of stupid repetitive code with the Ruby C API, I first had to wrap my C++ classes such that they were accessible from C and then wrap and unwrap Ruby types etc, additionally I had to check for this stupid flag in every single method, so I migrated to Rice, which is really nice and I am very glad about that.</p>

<p>In Rice, however, the programmer can only provide a constructor which is called in the initialize() function created by rice and the allocate() function is predefined and does nothing. I don't think there is an easy way to change this or provide an own allocate function in an ""official"" way. Of course, I could still use the C API to define the allocate function, so I tried to mix the C API and Rice somehow, but then I got really nasty, I got strange SegFaults and it was really ugly, so I abandoned that idea.</p>

<p>Does anyone here have experiences with Rice or does anyone know how to make this safe?</p>

<p>Based on this code I am trying to display an Aspose. Words document converted into an pdf in the browser / trying to create a download dialog in the browser for said document.</p>

<p>When I execute the action there is no error message. The contents of the pdf are then displayed within the response message of the chrome debugger. The response also holds the appropriate size ( 60kb for the pdf ). It simply does not start a download or displays the pdf in the browser and I wonder why that would be.</p>

<p>I also tried an alternative provided by Aspose:</p>

<pre><code>        var resp = System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response;
        resp.Clear();
        // Create Memory Stream Object
        MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();
        doc.Save(stream, SaveFormat.Pdf);
        doc.Save(resp, fileName, ContentDisposition.Attachment,                                SaveOptions.CreateSaveOptions(
        SaveFormat.Pdf));
        resp.End();
</code></pre>

<p>Which leads to the exact same result the pdf being displayed in the response not the browser itself.</p>

<p>The controller action executing this code is called by the ajax statement:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#btnReport"").click(function () {

            var datum = $(""#hiddenDatum"").val();

            $.ajax({
                type: ""GET"",
                url: '@Url.Action(""GenerateMonthlyReport"", ""Reporting"")',

                }
            });
        });

<p>Any suggestions to what I am doing wrong would be highly appreciated.</p>

swaggerUi.api.clientAuthorizations.add('username', new SwaggerClient.ApiKeyAuthorization('username', username, 'query'));
</code></pre>

<p>But this results in only the first one of them being passed to the XHR, e.g.:</p>

<p><a href=""http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/capability?api_key=api_key"" rel=""nofollow"">http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/capability?api_key=api_key</a></p>

<p>If I swap the order:</p>

<pre><code>swaggerUi.api.clientAuthorizations.add('username', new SwaggerClient.ApiKeyAuthorization('username', username, 'query'));
swaggerUi.api.clientAuthorizations.add('api_key', new SwaggerClient.ApiKeyAuthorization('api_key', api_key, 'query'));
</code></pre>

<p>Then:</p>

<p><a href=""http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/channel?username=username"" rel=""nofollow"">http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/channel?username=username</a></p>

<p>I've also tried using the object notation in add:</p>

<pre><code>swaggerUi.api.clientAuthorizations.add({
    'api_key': new SwaggerClient.ApiKeyAuthorization(""api_key"", api_key, ""query""),
    'username': new SwaggerClient.ApiKeyAuthorization(""username"", username, ""query"")
});
</code></pre>

<p>But again only single parameter was passed:</p>

<p><a href=""http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/capability?api_key=api_key"" rel=""nofollow"">http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/capability?api_key=api_key</a></p>

<p>The name of the function suggests it should be possible to pass multiple authorization params without any collisions but the practice shows otherwise.</p>

<p>I'm working in WPF with SlimDX.
The target is a program that initializes a Direct3D device, and is able to render cool D3D11 gfx to an offscreen rendertarget.</p>

<p>Users can add output-windows, and output-windows can either be full-screen on any connected monitor, or just a window.
An output window just shows a <em>part</em> of the offscreen-backbuffer.
So - I have a very highres offscreen texture / backbuffer, and I want zero to N output windows basicly rendering a fullscreen quad with uv-coords specifying an area in that highres texture.</p>

<p>My questions are :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is the 'correct' way in SlimDX to initialize a Direct3D device in the main application, without any output-window / swapchain yet ?</p></li>
<li><p>Once I have a 'global' Direct3D 11 device, how do I set up an offscreen rendertarget texture where I can render cool stuff to ?</p></li>
<li><p>once I have an offscreen rendertarget with cool stuff rendered in it, how do I set up a system so I can add / remove windows that show <em>parts</em> of this rendertarget ?
(For each dynamicly created / removed window, add / remove part of the swapchain?)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know these problems are quite specific and most people don't ever want to render stuff in the background to be displayed on different devices, but hey - that's what stackoverflow is for  :)</p>

Our system works as followed: </p>

<p>We pack our files into 4 GB packages, 
we download byte ranges of 128 ranges or maximum 100 MB per request (a Range is maximum 10 MB).</p>

<p>Usually we send 20+- requests (we never download the entire 4 GB file just the pieces that are needed)</p>

<p>so my problem is as followed: sometimes I get a reply from the CDN of 200 (success) instead of 206 (success for byte range), according to the protocol this means the server had a problem with byte range.</p>

<p>The problem doesn't reproduce with a different CDN service I tested nor it reproduces when I work directly with our server.</p>

<p>I tried to download the same byte ranges with a script I wrote just for the tests (to be sure my code is not the problem) and I got the same results.</p>

<p>We've tried discussing the subject with our CDN provider but we've got the ""We don't see any problem on our end so it must be your problem"" answer.</p>

<p>My good people, do you have any idea how can I test this problem? How can I show them that the problem is at their side? Do you have any ideas about my problem?</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<ul>
<li>The problem doesn't always reproduce we have thousands of successful runs.</li>
<li>We have cases where in the same run some of the byte ranges ""fail"" and some success (in my case fail = return status of 200)</li>

<p>And each of the core files that I have rewritten, are extended them from the original Review Model files and Adminhtml/Block/Review Edit files.I have copy pasted the same code just with the extra 'email' field in my code.</p>

<p>I have manually added the field in the database now and have added the input field in base/defaut/review/form.phtml but still it doesn't save the data in the table.</p>

<p>However if I try to add this field by editing the core files then it saves the email id of guest customers and works perfectly fine.</p>

<p>Can't figure out what I'm doing wrong? </p>

<p>I think I'm close to getting it. I tried putting a few echo statements in the fourth nested foreach loop, but nothing was out. So its not executing that loop. I've been at this for a few hours and googled as well, just can't manage to get it.</p>

<p>If all else fails, I'll just go back to using two loops.</p>

At least one user is able to launch the app just fine under Snow Leopard.  From my (admittedly small) sample set, I think the problem is specific to 64-bit machines running Leopard.</p>

<p>My project is compiled with the 10.6 SDK with the Deployment Target set to 10.4.</p>

<p>I recompiled using the 10.5 SDK and the problem goes away.  My best guess is that it's related to NSURL moving from Foundation to CoreFoundation in Snow Leopard (see <a href=""http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/280239-nsurl-crash.html?q=%22nsurl+crash%22#280239"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/280239-nsurl-crash.html?q=%22nsurl+crash%22#280239</a>).  The thing I don't understand is why it would work fine on my (32-bit) PowerBook G4, but not on the user's 64-bit Intel Mac even though both are running Leopard.</p>

<p>Imagine, for example, I want to generate random pairs of integers using the sequence of integer <code>1:4</code> to populate the elements of the pair.  Also assume I want to generate 5 random pairs without replacement.  I then want to be able to generate something like this...</p>

<pre><code>     [,1] [,2]

[3,]    3    3

[5,]    4    3

<p>In the above example, there are no duplicate pairs (i.e rows).  There are, however, duplicate integers within each column of the above matrix.  Consequently, using <code>sample()</code> to generate random number for each column separately will not work.</p>

<p>Another seemingly potential solution which will not work for my context is to generate numerous pairs which include duplicates and then delete these duplicates retroactively.  I can't do this because I will need to generate a specific number of pairs.    </p>

r.mat&lt;-matrix(1:(4*4),4,4) 
#Drawing a random id
r.id&lt;-sample(r.mat,5,replace=FALSE)
#Mapping the random id to a random pair
r.pair&lt;-t(sapply(r.id, function (x) which(r.mat==x,arr.ind=TRUE)))

<p>If a file is already gzipped, it should be cached in local disk, and next time someone visit that file again, iis kernel should return the cache gzip file directly without compressing it again. Is that right?</p>

The problem is it works too good. It disables the section on a new form.  For brevity  here are the 2 fields, the hidden values of those fields and the jquery script.</p>

<p>This is the code of the fields when adding a new form or record.
These 2 forms are within the div with the id supersection.
Here is the html for the 2 fields
First the hidden values of the fields in the form then the html of the fields themselves.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""supersection"" style=""border: none;""&gt;

Complete and sign&lt;/label&gt;

&lt;label for=""superdeclare""&gt;
&lt;input type=""checkbox"" value=""1"" id=""superdeclare"" name=""superdeclare""  /&gt;
I have completed with the best info from all parties&lt;/label&gt;

The thought process was get two arrays (one containing the entry ids and the other the field ids) and check the input table to see if there was an existing row for every field and entry. If not then use an inert into command to add a row with the value 0, but this command is failing. My guess is a timeout error due to the intensity of this function. Any suggestions?</p>

  <p>It is possible to create tables using

currently writing unit tests for a django custom auth-backend. On our
system we actually have two backends: one the built-in django backend
and the custom backend that sends out requests to a Java based API
that returns user info in the form of XML. Now, I am writing unit
tests so I don't want to be sending requests outside the system like
that, I'm not trying to test the Java API, so my question is how can I
get around this and mock the side-effects in the most robust way.</p>

<p>The function I am testing is something like this, where the url
settings value is just the base url for the Java server that
authenticates the username and password data and returns the xml, and the service value is
just some magic for building the url query, its unimportant for
us:</p>

<pre><code>@staticmethod
def get_info_from_api_with_un_pw(username, password, service=12345):
    url = settings.AUTHENTICATE_URL_VIA_PASSWORD
    if AUTH_FIELD == ""username"":
        params = {""nick"": username, ""password"": password}
    elif AUTH_FIELD == ""email"":
        params = {""email"": username, ""password"": password}
    params[""service""] = service
    encoded_params = urlencode([(k, smart_str(v, ""latin1"")) for k, v in params.items()])
    try:
        # get the user's data from the api
        xml = urlopen(url + encoded_params).read()
        userinfo = dict((e.tag, smart_unicode(e.text, strings_only=True))
                        for e in ET.fromstring(xml).getchildren())
        if ""nil"" in userinfo:
            return userinfo
        else:
            return None
</code></pre>

<p>So, we get the xml, parse it into a dict and if the key nil is present
then we can return the dict and carry on happy and authenticated.
Clearly, one solution is just to find a way to somehow override or
monkeypatch the logic in the xml variable, I found this answer:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/295438/how-can-one-mock-stub-python-module-like-urllib"">How can one mock/stub python module like urllib</a></p>

<p>I tried to implement something like that, but the details there are
very sketchy and I couldn't seem to get that working.</p>

<p>I also captured the xml response and put it in a local file in the
test folder with the intention of finding a way to use that as a mock
response that is passed into the url parameter of the test function,
something like this will override the url:</p>

<pre><code>@override_settings(AUTHENTICATE_URL_VIA_PASSWORD=(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), ""{0}"".format(""response.xml""))))
def test_get_user_info_username(self):
    self.backend = RemoteAuthBackend()
    self.backend.get_info_from_api_with_un_pw(""user"", ""pass"")
</code></pre>

<p>But that also needs to take account of the url building logic that the
function defines, (i.e. ""url + encoded_params""). Again, I could rename
the response file to be the same as the concatenated url but this is becoming
less like a good unit-test for the function and more of a ""cheat"", the whole
thing is just getting more and more brittle all the time with these solutions, and its really just a fixture anyway, which is also something I want to avoid if
at all possible. </p>

<p>I also wondered if there might be a way to serve the xml on the django development server and then point the function at that? It seems like a saner solution, but much googling gave me no clues if such a thing would be possible or advisable and even then I don't think that would be a test to run outside of the development environment.</p>

<p>So, ideally, I need to be able to somehow mock a ""server"" to
take the place of the Java API in the function call, or somehow serve
up some xml payload that the function can open as its url, or
monkeypatch the function from the test itself, or...</p>

<p>Does the mock library have the appropriate tools to do such things?</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock"">http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock</a></p>

<p>So, there are two points to this question 1) I would like to solve my
particular problem in a clean way, and more importantly 2) what are
the best practices for cleanly writing Django unit-tests when you are
dependent on data, cookies, etc. for user authentication from a remote

<p>The customer has a application server and a database server. The application server (win 2008) runs a ASP.NET MVC 3 App. The database server (also Win 2008) runs SQL Server 2008.</p>

<p>Whenever a request to the database is made, CPU for w3wp.exe goes up to 50 - 80 % and network traffic reaches 2% (of 10 Gbps). This takes a minute or so after which the requested web page is displayed.</p>

<p>I checked the actual Linq execution time and it only takes a few milliseconds to get the data.</p>

<p>I hope some of the professionals here can shed some light on what's going on. Of course, it works on my machine. </p>

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<p>Even a query executed from SQL Server Management Studio (on the app server) that retrieves 828 rows takes a full 12 seconds to complete... So I guess the problem is not the app but somewhere on the database server or the connection</p>

<p><strong>update 2</strong>
Here's something interesting I found out.</p>

<p>This is the slow code:</p>

<pre><code>MyAppDataContext DataContext = MyAppDataContext.CreateNewContext();
IEnumerable&lt;Requests&gt; Entities = DataContext.Requests;

using (profiler.Step(""get data"")) {
    IEnumerable&lt;Requests&gt; dataset = from x in Entities
                                    where x.ControleStatus == 4
                                    orderby x.ID
                                    select x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But when I change IEnumerable to IQueryable, the code executes 10x faster:</p>

<pre><code>MyAppDataContext DataContext = MyAppDataContext.CreateNewContext();
IQueryable&lt;Requests&gt; Entities = DataContext.Requests.AsQueryable();

using (profiler.Step(""get data"")) {
    IQueryable&lt;Requests&gt; dataset = from x in Entities
                                   where x.ControleStatus == 4
                                   orderby x.ID
                                   select x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is: what could be causing this big difference between IEnumerable and IQueryable ?</p>

<p>The model is described in the following way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Model's job is to represent the problem domain, maintain state, and provide methods for accessing and mutating the state of the application. The Model layer is typically broken down into several different layers:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Service layer</strong> - this layer provides cohesive, high-level logic for
  related parts of an application. This layer is invoked directly by
  the Controller and View helpers.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Data Access layer</strong> - (ex. Data Gateway, Data Access Object) this layer
  provides access to the persistence layer. This layer is only ever
  invoked by Service objects. Objects in the data access layer do not
  know about each other.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Value Objects layer</strong> - this layer provides simple, data-oriented
  representations of ""leaf"" nodes in your model hierarchy.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the goal of the <strong>Value Objects layer</strong>? I couldn't find any good explanation...</p>

<p>Let's say I'm designing a (C#) library that is agnostic in which system it gets used in. So I have the following classes:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IAction
{
    void Execute();
}

public class Trigger
{
    private List&lt;IAction&gt; actions;

    public void CheckConditions()
    {
        if (AllConditionsMet())
        {
           ExecuteAllActions();
        }
    }

    private void ExecuteAllActions()
    {
        foreach (IAction action in actions)
        {
            action.Execute();
        }
    }

    protected abstract bool AllConditionsMet();
}

public class BigBulkySystem
{
    private List&lt;Trigger&gt; triggers;

    public void CheckAllTriggers()
    {
        foreach (Trigger trigger in triggers)
        {
            trigger.CheckConditions();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good. We have a list of triggers in the BigBulkySystem which we check ever so often their conditions. If the conditions are met, the trigger takes care of executing its list of actions.</p>

<p>The issue I'm having now is that I want to implement a layer that is specifically designed for <a href=""https://unity3d.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Unity</a>. In Unity, you use <a href=""http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">coroutines</a> in order to be able to wait a few frames before continuing the execution of a method. This is exactly what I'd want for the Trigger.ExecuteAllActions method. I want to wait for each action to finish executing before moving to the next. In order to do that, I would need to have different signatures for the Trigger and IAction. Here is how this would have been in Unity:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IAction
{
    IEnumerator Execute();
}

public class Trigger
{
    private List&lt;IAction&gt; actions;

    public void CheckConditions()
    {
        if (AllConditionsMet())
        {
            StartCoroutine(ExecuteAllActions());
        }
     }

    public IEnunmerator ExecuteAllActions()
    {
        foreach (IAction action in actions)
        {
            yield return StartCoroutine(action.Execute());
        }
    }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that a couple of methods now return IEnumerator instead of void, which is the way you define a coroutine in Unity.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a Unity action that moves a player object from position (0,0,0) to (1,1,1) in 5 seconds after a 3 second delay:</p>

<pre><code>public class MovePlayerAction : IAction
{
    public GameObject playerObject;

    public IEnumerator Execute()
    {
        yield return StartCoroutine(WaitFor(3)); // Wait 3 secs

        float animDuration = 5.0f;
        Vector3 initialPos = Vector3.zero;
        Vector3 finalPos = Vector3.one;
        float t = 0;
        while (t &lt; animDuration)
        {
            playerObject.transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(initialPos, finalPos, t / animDuration); // Lerp between initial and final
            yield return null; // Wait a frame
            t += Time.deltaTime;
        }
    }

    private IEnumerator WaitFor(float secs)
    {
        float t = 0;
        while (t &lt; secs)
        {
            yield return null; // Wait a single frame
            t += Time.deltaTime;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, my question is: <strong>is there a way to design the system in such a way that I can keep the non-Unity layer free from IEnumerator but also have the Unity layer use them?</strong></p>

<p>I have a feeling that there is some sort of middle layer, but even so, I couldn't figure out how IAction can have simultaneously <code>void Execute()</code> and <code>IEnumerator Execute()</code>.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>my directive</p>

<pre><code>app.directive('fixHeader', function () {

You can't just override <code>__setattr__</code>, because then you can't even set attributes in the <code>__init__</code>. Subclassing a tuple is a trick that works:</p>

<pre><code>class Immutable(tuple):

    def __new__(cls, a, b):
        return tuple.__new__(cls, (a, b))

    @property
    def a(self):
        return self[0]

    @property
    def b(self):
        return self[1]

    def __str__(self):
        return ""&lt;Immutable {0}, {1}&gt;"".format(self.a, self.b)

    def __setattr__(self, *ignored):
        return NotImplemented

    def __delattr__(self, *ignored):
        return NotImplemented
</code></pre>

<p>But then you have access to the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> variables through <code>self[0]</code> and <code>self[1]</code>, which is annoying.</p>

<p>Is this possible in Pure Python? If not, how would I do it with a C extension?</p>

<p>(Answers that work only in Python 3 are acceptable).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> </p>

<p>So subclassing tuple is the way to do it in Pure Python, which works well except for the additional possibility of accessing the data by <code>[0]</code>, <code>[1]</code> etc. So, to complete this question all that is missing is howto do it ""properly"" in C, which I suspect would be quite simple, by just not implementing any <code>geititem</code> or <code>setattribute</code>, etc. But instead of doing it myself, I offer a bounty for that, because I'm lazy. :)</p>

<p>What I want to be able to do is re-route the requests that Zuul receives at the beginning of the process, to redirect them through particular services, using URL parameters to determine which process should be aimed instead of another.
I already have created a filter tagged with the <code>@Component</code> annotation, implementing <code>ZuulFilter</code>. What I don't know, is how to make the redirections work, and which methods to use.</p>

It is the first time I try to test a REST service and how many concurrent users can it take. While LoadStorm looks like the best product for something like this, I want something free.</p>

<p>I began using the LoadAndPerformanceTestProject project in Visual Studio. I created a loadTest, as you can see in the image, but I have no idea how to set the url I want to test. (see image below)
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VwuQC.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
Questions:
1) where do you set the url you want to test and the request parameters for my REST service?
2) is this tool just a programs that runs on my machine and makes requests to the server?
3) what can I do to run it in the cloud so I can get more accurate results? I have a MSDN subscription, and the URL I use is actually my project that is in Azure. </p>

<p>These are a lot of questions, but I don't see any tutorial online on how to use this feature. I saw this video <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc9M6NN_VmU"" rel=""nofollow"">enter link description here</a> but unfortunately when I go to TEST in the menu bar, I have different options from the video - see picture bellow. In the video is seams like he doesn't have to add a LoadAndPerformanceTestProject at all.

<p>Can you give me any clue or idea about it? I can't change my xml so if I have to make any change, it should come in php code.</p>

So basically, both capture outputs are added to the AVCaptureSession instance, using the preset AVCaptureSessionPresetPhoto for best resolutions (photo as documented, for video 852x640 - docs say it's not supported but works anyway). The second reason to use AVCaptureSessionPresetPhoto is because the ""field of view"" is more extended than with other high quality presets, allowing to hold objects nearer to the camera to ease steady holding).</p>

<p>It all worked fine until iOS 5.1 was released, which caused a significant throttle in quality when taking the still image. The resolution of the still image has dropped to 640x480. I tried  taking the still image manually with the use of a button, not having the video data output added to the AVCaptureSession, which delivers a high quality image again (as expected).</p>

<p>I really appreciate giving solution hints for this problem!!</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>PS: Setup of capture session and outputs were done according to other sample Apps like AVCam, etc. So I don't suspect an issue in configuring the setup.</p>

But, when the boss asks you to do something, you do it. I apologize in advance for poor formatting, improper DB management, and my general lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>Anyways, I have a large table in a query that I need to use combo boxes to organize. The query's name is FinalTable, and the Fields that I would like to have the combo boxes named from are ID Maker.Billet Material, ID Maker.Billet Number, ID Maker.Test Type, and ID Maker.Axis. Once each box is updated, I want to display the rest of the fields for that row.</p>

<p>Here's what I have in the code for the form so far. It's ripped from a tutorial that I found while googling, but I am hopelessly lost and confused now and can't figure out what to do next. </p>

This graph uses an adjacency list representation, built on-top of a List struct that I had previously built. Anyways, I'm trying to load in the graph from a file then perform BFS on it, but if I perform BFS on a graph (loaded from a file) with over 30 vertices, I get a segfault during a malloc call. If I, however, don't load the graph from file and instead make it by hand (using loops and manually adding vertices/edges), I can have thousands of vertices and 10k+ edges and no segfaults occur at all. This obviously makes me think that something that I'm doing while loading in the graph data is corrupting the heap, but the odd thing is that the malloc call that fails isn't in the function that reads from the file, and the function does correctly translate the input file into a graph data structure, so I am lost. Below is the function that reads in from the input file.</p>

<p>The following is my output on GDB :</p>

<pre><code>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

</code></pre>

<p>I would like to stress that there has to be something inside of this function that is causing my heap to corrupt, even though the corruption doesn't show until a bit later. </p>

<pre><code>Graph readFile(char * fn) {

  FILE * fp = fopen(fn, ""r"");
  char line[80];

  if(fp == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, ""Error : Invalid Filename Argument"");
    exit(1);
  }

  fgets(line, 80, fp);
  int order = 0;
  sscanf(line, ""%d"", &amp;order);
  if(order &lt;= 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, ""Error parsing input file, order &lt; 0"");
    exit(1);
  }
  printf(""%d\n"", order);
  Graph new_graph = newGraph(order);

  while(fgets(line, 80, fp) != NULL)
  {
    int origin = -1;
    int terminus = -1; 
    sscanf(line, ""%d %d"", &amp;origin, &amp;terminus);
    printf(""%d %d\n"", origin, terminus);
    if(origin &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; terminus &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; origin &lt;= order &amp;&amp; terminus &lt;= order) {

    }
  }
   fclose(fp);

<pre><code>            var authService = AppHostBase.Resolve&lt;AuthService&gt;();
            authService.RequestContext = System.Web.HttpContext.Current.ToRequestContext();
            var AuthResponse = authService.Authenticate(new Auth
            {
                provider = ""credentials"",
                UserName = user.user_id,
                Password = user.password,
                RememberMe = true
            });


            if (AuthResponse.SessionId != null)
            {
                Session[""IsAuthenticated""] = true;
                Session[""UserID""] = AuthResponse.UserName;
                FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(user.user_id, true);
                return Redirect(""/home"");
            }
            else
            {
                Session[""IsAuthenticated""] = false;
            }
</code></pre>

<p>When I try and run the application, I get the error:</p>

<p>""<em>AppHostBase is not initialized.</em>""</p>

<p>What might I be missing? I apologize in advance for my inexperience with ASP.net in general.  </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> </p>

<p>I should point out that this is only an MCV4 client application that will be using a ServiceStack API that is part of a different project.  </p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>I think this might be a part of my not perfect understanding of SS and how it would fit into a web application such as this. I believe what I may really be after is understanding just how this ASP.net client can hook back up with an existing session on the ServiceStack API server. </p>

"25255736","1","25257370","","2014-08-12 03:33:42","","3","692","<p>I was playing around with binary serialization and deserialization in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Rust</a> and noticed that binary deserialization is several orders of magnitude slower than with Java. To eliminate the possibility of overhead due to, for example, allocations and overheads, I'm simply reading a binary stream from each program. Each program reads from a binary file on disk which contains a 4-byte integer containing the number of input values, and a contiguous chunk of 8-byte big-endian <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point"" rel=""nofollow"">IEEE&nbsp;754</a>-encoded floating point numbers. Here's the Java implementation:</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.*;

public class ReadBinary {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        DataInputStream input = new DataInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(args[0])));
        int inputLength = input.readInt();
        System.out.println(""input length: "" + inputLength);
        try {
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; inputLength; i++) {
                double d = input.readDouble();
                if (i == inputLength - 1) {
                    System.out.println(d);
                }
            }
        } finally {
            input.close()
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the Rust implementation:</p>

<pre><code>fn main() {
    use std::os;
    use std::io::File;
    use std::io::BufferedReader;

    let args = os::args();
    let fname = args[1].as_slice();
    let path = Path::new(fname);
    let mut file = BufferedReader::new(File::open(&amp;path));
    let input_length = read_int(&amp;mut file) as uint;
    for i in range(0u, input_length) {
        let d = read_double_slow(&amp;mut file);
        if i == input_length - 1 {
            println!(""{}"", d);
        }
    }
}

fn read_int&lt;R : Reader&gt;(input: &amp;mut R) -&gt; i32 {
    match input.read_be_i32() {
        Ok(x) =&gt; x,
        Err(e) =&gt; fail!(e)
    }
}

fn read_double_slow&lt;R : Reader&gt;(input: &amp;mut R) -&gt; f64 {
    match input.read_be_f64() {
        Ok(x) =&gt; x,
        Err(e) =&gt; fail!(e)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm outputting the last value to make sure that all of the input is actually being read. On my machine, when the file contains (the same) 30 million randomly-generated doubles, the Java version runs in 0.8 seconds, while the Rust version runs in 40.8 seconds.</p>

<p>Suspicious of inefficiencies in Rust's byte interpretation itself, I retried it with a custom floating point deserialization implementation. The internals are <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/9dcf89567ebfb97c1a3b44d0a800f97935eb948e/src/libstd/io/mod.rs#L850"" rel=""nofollow"">almost exactly the same as what's being done in Rust's Reader</a>, without the <code>IoResult</code> wrappers:</p>

<pre><code>fn read_double&lt;R : Reader&gt;(input: &amp;mut R, buffer: &amp;mut [u8]) -&gt; f64 {
    use std::mem::transmute;
    match input.read_at_least(8, buffer) {
        Ok(n) =&gt; if n &gt; 8 { fail!(""n &gt; 8"") },
        Err(e) =&gt; fail!(e)
    };
    let mut val = 0u64;
    let mut i = 8;
    while i &gt; 0 {
        i -= 1;
        val += buffer[7-i] as u64 &lt;&lt; i * 8;
    }
    unsafe {
        transmute::&lt;u64, f64&gt;(val);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The only change I made to the earlier Rust code in order to make this work was create an 8-byte slice to be passed in and (re)used as a buffer in the <code>read_double</code> function. This yielded a significant performance gain, running in about 5.6 seconds on average. Unfortunately, this is <em>still</em> noticeably slower (and more verbose!) than the Java version, making it difficult to scale up to larger input sets. Is there something that can be done to make this run faster in Rust? More importantly, is it possible to make these changes in such a way that they can be merged into the default <code>Reader</code> implementation itself to make binary I/O less painful?</p>

<p>For reference, here's the code I'm using to generate the input file:</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.*;
import java.util.Random;

public class MakeBinary {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(System.out));
        int outputLength = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        output.writeInt(outputLength);
        Random rand = new Random();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; outputLength; i++) {
            output.writeDouble(rand.nextDouble() * 10 + 1);
        }
        output.flush();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Note that generating the random numbers <em>and</em> writing them to disk only takes 3.8 seconds on my test machine.)</p>

However, this time I tried to upload the web to another server, and in this one the code, which is exactly the same working on the other sites, does not work well. I was simplifying the mistake and must be in one of the following lines.</p>

<p>If I type on the URL my website, my code has to add the default language to the URL automatically (which is <strong>es</strong>), if this one has not been specified yet. For example, if I type <strong>mydomain.com</strong>, it must be converted to <strong>mydomain.com/es</strong>.</p>

<p>Here the codes (<em>Note: lang was declared in htaccess, and is the name of the first parameter introduced on the URL, in this case, the language</em>):</p>

<p><strong>index.php CODE:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    $idiomas = array(""ES"", ""GL"", ""EN"");
    if (!(isset($_GET['lang']) &amp;&amp; $_GET['lang'] == ""admin"")) {
        require_once(""pages/language.php"");
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>language.php CODE:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    if (isset($_GET['lang']) &amp;&amp; $_GET['lang'] != """") {
        switch ($_GET['lang']) {
            case strtolower($idiomas[0]):
            case strtolower($idiomas[1]):
            case strtolower($idiomas[2]):
            case 'admin':
                $_SESSION['lang'] = $_GET['lang'];
                break;
            default: {
                header(""Location: "".ROOT);
            }
        }
    }
    else {
        if (!isset($_SESSION['lang']) || $_SESSION['lang'] == """") {
            echo '&lt;meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content=""0; url='.strtolower($idiomas[0]).'""&gt;';
            exit;
        }
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what is happening is: you type <strong>mydomain.com</strong> and this one is converted to <strong>mydomain.com/es</strong> on the URL, right, but it starts to do this each milisecond, reloading and reloading the page forever. I realised that when <strong>mydomain.com/es</strong> is already on the URL, in <strong>language.php</strong> the first condition of the <strong>if</strong> is not kept, and it should be kept.</p>

<p>I do not know why this code always worked in different servers and not in this one. Any idea, please? Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>POEdit (xgettext) will search for keywords to find strings to translate. So, if searching for the keyword <code>translate</code>, POEdit will have no problem finding the <code>'Text to translate'</code> string when the text is passed to the translate function directly like:</p>

<pre><code>echo translate('Text to translate');
</code></pre>

<p>But, in ofther cases strings will be passed to Zend functions that will do the translation for me, calling the translate function with a variable as a parameter:</p>

<pre><code>function SomeZendFunction( $array ) {
    return translate( $array['string'] );
}

...

echo SomeZendFunction( array('string'=&gt;'Another text to translate') );
// translate('Another text to translate');
</code></pre>

<p>This will cause POEdit (xgettext) to fail finding the string to translate. In the above example the string I wanted POEdit to find is <code>'Another text to translate'</code>, but since it is not passed directly to the <code>translate</code> function, it will not be found.</p>

<p>So, how to solve the problem?</p>

<p>My current solution is to create a dummy file containing a long list of all the strings that was not found by POEdit:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php // Dummy file, only accessed by POEdit when scanning for strings to translate
translate('Text to translate');
translate('Another text to translate');
translate('A third text to translate');
....
</code></pre>

<p>But the downside of this solution is that when updating a string, I both need to change the dummy file and find the original string. This will make it more hard to maintain.</p>

<p>Another solution I thought of was adding the translation string to a comment after calling <code>SomeZendFunction</code> (See the above example), but I fail to make xgettext accept it as it ignores comments.</p>

<p>So, anyone knows how to make xgettext to accept strings within comments? Or anyone has any other solution that might be better?</p>

<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>I am mounting FUSE in a directory ('home/fsc') without problem, even listing it's parent dir (/home) the following way:</p>

<p>while on /home .. ls -l</p>

<p>And the operation getattr works just fine.</p>

<p>Problem occurs when I open the directory ('cd fsc'), it opens correctly, and debugging the operations I can see how fuse asks for '/' file attributes, but when I try to list files inside that directory, fuse asks for the attributes of  '/tls' in an infinite loop recieving always error '2', 'No such file or directory' until it disconnects.</p>

<p>What I find even more curious is that it never goes into the readdir operation, as I expected.</p>

<p>Any idea on why could this be happening? Why is fuse asking for '/tls' attributes instead of executing readdir of '/' ?</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your help here, I need a solution for this for a University project I need to have working soon, so help is very much appreciated!.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I have just noticed that it also asks for the file attirbutes of '/i686','/sse2','/cmov', '/librt.so.1' during this loop and then goes back again to '/tls'</p>

<p>I am deploying our system using Maven, and a full deployment would take several steps, in order. If a change is made to a middle step, only that step and it's dependent steps needs to be redeployed. The steps are time consuming, and so deploying everything from scratch (currently ~35 minutes) is very painful. (For those interested, there is remote database deployment, followed by the creation and deployment of 2 base docker images and several docker image/containers.)</p>

<p>The deployment steps are basically ""copy these files to remote server by scp, then run this command via sshexec"". As such, it is currently a long single ant task with these steps.</p>

<p>If I were using Ant proper, I'd be able to specify targets and do it that way. I'm not unfamiliar with Maven, but I don't know the proper idiomatic way of dealing with this sort of process. I've seen someone suggest using profiles and this seems the most suitable solution, however there is one step I haven't been able to duplicate.</p>

<p>Say I have 5 steps, step 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 5 depends on 4, 4 on 3, etc. I can have a profile step for each, and run <code>mvn -P 1,2,3,4,5</code> to get what I need. If I only make a change to 3, then I could run <code>mvn -P 3,4,5</code>, my problem is however that there are many more steps, not so obviously numbered and it is a moving target at the moment for the other developers as we build our product.</p>

<p>Is there a way, using profiles or otherwise, for me and my developers to basically say <code>mvn -P stepX</code> and the profile set up in step ""x"" to say ""run profile X, then Y, then Z"" ?</p>

<p>Many thanks,
Mitch.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong>
I just ran into the problem and here is the faulty SQL:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) AS `count` FROM `albums_songs` AS `AlbumSong`   WHERE `ArtistGenre`.`id` = 26482
</code></pre>

<p>AlbumSong and ArtistGenre are two completely separate tables and they are not related at all.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>
Just ran into another failure. The code is:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;Song-&gt;find('first', array('conditions' =&gt; array('Song.artist_id' =&gt; 30188, 'Song.name' =&gt; 'Pal Pal (By.Tarkhanz)'), 'fields' =&gt; array('Song.id')))
</code></pre>

<p>While the generated SQL is:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT `Song`.`id` FROM `songs` AS `Song`   WHERE `Artist`.`name` = 'Annie Villeneuve'    LIMIT 1 
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see no were in the conditions do I specify an Artist.name yet the SQL generated is looking at it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong>
Another example failure. Call is as followed:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;Song-&gt;id = $song_id;
$library_count = $this-&gt;Song-&gt;field('Song.library_count');
</code></pre>

<p>Yet the SQL is:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT `Song`.`library_count` FROM `songs` AS `Song`   WHERE `Artist`.`name` = 'Mazikana_Ragheb_Allama'    LIMIT 1
</code></pre>

<p>where Artist.name is not a column of Song as it belongs to the Artist model.</p>

<p>The template implementation are trivial(form.as_p), so I'll just skip it here</p>

<p>This problem does not exist on my developing platform(Windows 7 Pro 64bit), but it occurs in my deploying platform(Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64bit, both Desktop and Server have this). I am not sure what would happen if I changed to other linux platform or Mac.</p>

<p>This problem does not matter whether I put it in Apache2 + mod_wsgi nor manage.py runserver, neither does gunicorn. All have the same problem, so it's probably no deploy specific problem. </p>

<p>I am complete clueless about what did I do wrong? Any lead would be appreciated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An isolation level has connection-wide
  scope, and once set for a connection
  with the SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION
  LEVEL statement, it remains in effect
  until the connection is closed or
  another isolation level is set. When a
  connection is closed and returned to
  the pool, the isolation level from the
  last SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL
  statement is retained. Subsequent
  connections reusing a pooled
  connection use the isolation level
  that was in effect at the time the
  connection is pooled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection_members%28v=VS.71%29.aspx"">SqlConnection</a> class has no member that may hold the isolation level. So how does a connection know what isolation level to run in???  </p>

<p>The reason I'm asking this is because of the following scenario:  </p>

<ol>
<li>I opened a transaction using
TransactionScope in Serializable
mode, say ""T1"".</li>
<li>Opened a connection for T1.</li>
<li>T1 is finished/disposed, connection
goes back to connection pool.</li>
<li>Called another query on same
connection (after getting it from
connection pool) and this query runs
in serializable mode!!!</li>
</ol>

<p>Problem:  </p>

<ol>
<li>How does the pooled connection still
know what isolation level was
associated to it???</li>
<li>How to revert it back to some other
transaction level???</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Resolution:</strong><br>
  The reason why pooled connections are returning the serializable isolation level is because of the following reason:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>You have one connection pool (let's say CP1)</li>
  <li>CP1 may have 50 connections.</li>
  <li>You pick one connection C1 from CP1 and execute it with Serializable. This connection has its isolation level set now.
  Whatever you do, this will not be reset (unless this connection is
  used to execute a code in a different isolation level).</li>
  <li>After executing the query C1(Serializable) goes back to CP1.</li>
  <li>If steps 1-4 are executed again then the connection used may be some other connection than C1, let's say C2 or C3. So, that will also
  have its isolation level set to Serializable.</li>
  <li>So, slowly, Serialzable is set to multiple connections in CP1.</li>
  <li>When you execute a query where no explicit isolation level setting is being done, the connection picked from CP1 will decide the
  isolation level. For e.g. if such a query requests for a connection
  and CP1 uses C1(Serializable) to execute this query then this query
  will execute in Serializable mode even though you didn't explicitly
  set it.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Hope that clears a few doubts. :)</p>

The Arduino sends two numbers (<code>arrays1</code> &amp; <code>arrays2</code>) and I want them to be plotted (as they come) above a background plot that is configured on the Python code (<code>y=np.array</code>). The below code works but I face some problems with the speed of Matplotlib plotting.</p>

<p>When I send data from the Arduino with a <code>delay(1500)</code> everything works fine, they re plotted as they come.
When I send data from the Arduino every second, it starts plotting ok the first 30 values but then the plotting of the rest 18 values is delayed, happening every around 1.5 seconds. 
If I don't maximize the plotting window, or remove the <code>axvspan</code> command, it seems to be able to plot the values every 1 second! 
If I send values from the Arduino with a <code>delay(100)</code>, the Matplotlib cannot plot them more frequently than every 0.5-1 seconds.</p>

<p>The <code>celery inspect active</code> command returns the job specification itself on the blocked worker.</p>

<p>Referring from the reactiveUI source code, I found this extension method
<a href=""https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/blob/master/ReactiveUI/Cocoa/ReactiveTableViewSource.cs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/blob/master/ReactiveUI/Cocoa/ReactiveTableViewSource.cs</a></p>

<pre><code>   public static IDisposable BindTo&lt;TSource, TCell&gt;(
            this IObservable&lt;IReadOnlyList&lt;TableSectionInformation&lt;TSource, TCell&gt;&gt;&gt; sectionsObservable,
            UITableView tableView,
            Func&lt;ReactiveTableViewSource&lt;TSource&gt;, IDisposable&gt; initSource = null)
            where TCell : UITableViewCell
        {
            var source = new ReactiveTableViewSource&lt;TSource&gt;(tableView);
            if (initSource != null) initSource(source);

            var bind = sectionsObservable.BindTo(source, x =&gt; x.Data);
            tableView.Source = source;

            return new CompositeDisposable(bind, source);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>In viewmodel</p>

<pre><code>public class FilterSectionViewModel&lt;T,V&gt;  
    where V : UITableViewCell
{

    ReactiveList&lt;TableSectionInformation&lt;T,V&gt;&gt; sectionList;

    public ReactiveList&lt;TableSectionInformation&lt;T,V&gt;&gt; SectionList {
        get { 
            return sectionList;
        }
        set { this.RaiseAndSetIfChanged (ref sectionList, value); }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In view</p>

<pre><code>this.WhenAnyValue (x =&gt; x.ViewModel.SectionList).BindTo&lt;FilterVM,FilterCell&gt;(TableView);
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, this code work as expected in iOS application but I guess it should be better way to do it.</p>

<p>The problem I discover in this approach is that it exposes the iOS platform specific </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TableSectionInformation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in the view model so this view model can't be reuse in other platform.</p>

<p>Therefore, I modified the code in view model</p>

<pre><code>ReactiveList&lt;ReactiveList&lt;T&gt;&gt; sectionList;

        public ReactiveList&lt;ReactiveList&lt;T&gt;&gt; SectionList {
            get { 
                return sectionList;
            }
            set { this.RaiseAndSetIfChanged (ref sectionList, value); }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I don't know how to make the binding in view work. I guess I should convert the SectionList into IObservable by using method WhenAnyValue and project it into <code>List&lt;TableSectionInformation&gt;</code> so I can use it to BindTo my tableview with section.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I think this is a workaround, CreateSection is a static function which return type is TableSectionInformation.</p>

<pre><code>this.WhenAnyValue (x =&gt; x.ViewModel.SectionList)
.Select(s=&gt; CreateSection(s)).BindTo&lt;FilterVM,FilterCell&gt;(TableView);
</code></pre>

<p>The problem of this code is that instead of observe single property form a viewmodel define from <code>IViewFor&lt;FilterVM&gt;</code> which can bindto the tableview at once, it call bindto function everytime when the SectionList is changed.</p>

My goal is very simple, I want to record five consecutive images at the click of a button. Only I do not want to block the preview of the camera , so I use the previewFrame . But during the recording of my image in jpeg on the sd card it is green and pink with many horizontal bars. A term I will send a list of byte [] on a Web API.</p>

<p>I already do a lot of research , trying to change the PictureSize and PreviewSize but nothing changes .</p>

<p>Another option would it not go through recording a video and extract the frame of it ?</p>

<p>Here is the code in my fragment :</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Now the problem is: if I sign in twice with the same credentials I get an <code>InternalServerError</code>. This is right, because in my model configuration there is <code>UniqueUser email username</code>. So I'd like to catch and handle this error in some way. How can I do that and, in general, how exception handling works in Haskell when you are dealing with non-IO monads defined in an external library or framework?</p>

<p>PS: I read <a href=""http://mvanier.livejournal.com/5103.html"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""error-handling monads"">this</a> tutorial, but that is useful if you are designing a new library. I tryed to use the catch function, but I got a lot of type errors. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Thank you Ankur, your code worked with a little modification, to remove this error:</p>

<pre><code>   Ambiguous type variable `e0' in the constraint:
      (Exception e0) arising from a use of `catch'
   Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
</code></pre>

<p>code:</p>

<pre><code>tryInsert :: Text -&gt; Text -&gt; ByteString -&gt; Handler Bool
tryInsert email user pwd = HandlerT (\d -&gt; catch (unHandlerT (runDB $ insert $ User email user pwd) d 
                                                  &gt;&gt; return True)

<ol>
<li>The program creates a <strong>Garage</strong> object, which is basically a class that can contain a list of vehicles objects</li>
<li>Then the users creates <strong>Vehicles</strong> objects, these <strong>Vehicles</strong> each have a property, lets say <em>License Plate Nr</em>. Once created, the <strong>Vehicle</strong> object get added to a list within the <strong>Garage</strong> object</li>
<li>--<strong><em>Later on</em></strong>--, the user can specify that a given <strong>Vehicle</strong> object is in fact a <strong>Car</strong> object or a <strong>Truck</strong> object (thus giving access to some specific attributes such as <em>Number of seats</em> for the Car, or <em>Cargo weight</em> for the truck)</li>
</ol>

<p>At first sight, this might look like an OOP textbook question involving a base class and inheritance, but the problem is more subtle because at the object creation time (and until the user decides to give more info), the computer doesn't know the exact Vehicle type.</p>

<p>Hence my question: <strong>how would you proceed to implement this program flow? Is OOP the way to go?</strong></p>

<p>Just to give an initial answer, here is what I've came up until now. There is only one Vehicle class and the various properties/values are handled by the main program (not the class) through a dictionary. However, I'm pretty sure that there must be a more elegant solution (I'm developing using VB.net):</p>

<pre><code>Public Class Garage
    Public GarageAdress As String
    Private _ListGarageVehicles As New List(Of Vehicles)

    Public Sub AddVehicle(Vehicle As Vehicles)
        _ListGarageVehicles.Add(Vehicle)
    End Sub
End Class

Public Class Vehicles
    Public LicensePlateNumber As String
    Public Enum VehicleTypes
        Generic = 0
        Car = 1
        Truck = 2
    End Enum
    Public VehicleType As VehicleTypes
    Public DictVehicleProperties As New Dictionary(Of String, String)
End Class

<p>I published my MVC3 C# .NET web application to a IIS folder. I have selected the precompile options and unchecked the ""allow site to be updateable"" to ensure Views are compiled, and they are, to "".compiled"" files in bin ie:</p>

<pre><code>_createoredit.cshtml.1c32bb75.compiled
</code></pre>

<p>The ""cs"" files are compiled into the main project dll ie.</p>

<pre><code>myApp.dll
</code></pre>

<p>On first call, the page can take 30 - 60 secs to load then &lt; 1 sec</p>

<p>If I refresh the app pool the page then takes 30-60 secs again.</p>

<p>My current understanding is that this time delay is caused by the jitter compiling the byte code in the dll into binary code ??</p>

<p>I had hoped to significantly increase response time post app pool refresh by precompiling the Views. However not so, but perhaps this is due to the fact the my project file is in byte code, and that I need to do something more to it?</p>

<p>I do understand that you can keep web apps warm by repinging the site, but the reality is that app pools do get refreshed for strange reasons. Also I am using Azure. So I would really like to use deployed units of code that will run as quickly as possible after a refresh.</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Having precompiled the Views and deployed to Azure Websites using Shared or Standard instances, I still get the initial load lag, instigated by an AppPool refresh which I deliberately cause by a resave of the Web.config. To be honest I am not seeing any significant benefit in precompiling the Views, as I still get a time penalty when .NET seems to further compile the "".compiled"" views on first load.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong></p>

<p>More information in reference to @Yishal's post.</p>

<p>I am using Basic on dev and standard on test. I have enabled ""Always on"" which is in effect an autoping. I also have ""Uptime-robot"" autopinging. I have also tested a seperate shared site with all Views precompiled. The autopinging helps to keep the app pool warm. However if the app pool refreshes ie via web.config resave (for testing) then one get the long initial wait again. Can be up to a minute, then &lt; 1 sec for same page. The only thought I have is that it is taking ~ 60 secs for the project.dll(.net p-code) to be compiled down to binary and be held in RAM. </p>

Example, they type in ""Star"" and my Angular searchController outputs a JSON request from the internet movie database and displays all the titles with the name ""Star"" in it in a drop down display.</p>

<p>Now I want users to add the title of the movie (and poster etc, but that's later) to their movielist. I've completed the <a href=""https://thinkster.io/angular-rails/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thinkster.io/angular-rails/</a> tutorial which gave me some clues to store data but I find it very hard to completely understand how to do this. </p>

<p>I´ve created this little bit of jquery code that stores the title of the movie into a variable,</p>

<pre><code>  $(""#showresults"").on(""click"", "".search_results"", function() {
    var movieTitle = $(this).find("".ng-binding"").text();
    console.log (movieTitle)
  });
</code></pre>

<p>So I want to store the value of the variable <code>movieTitle</code> into my database, or ofcourse straight from the value of the element instead of storing it in a variable first. I've generated a model that created a movie table with some columns I need,</p>

<p>scherma.rb</p>

<pre><code>create_table ""movies"", force: :cascade do |t|
  t.datetime ""created_at"",   null: false
  t.datetime ""updated_at"",   null: false
  t.integer  ""user_id""
  t.string   ""image""
  t.string   ""title""
  t.string   ""release_date""

<p>The result is a simple checkmark by each UIPickerView item. This is great and all, but by default all of the elements of the PickerView are selected, which means they display a checkmark (I want none of them to be selected, except the ones I choose specifically in my code). Can you possible edit my methods and try to figure out how to do what I'm doing.</p>

<p>Also how am I going to be able to see the elements the user selected in my code. Help!</p>

  &lt;/Target&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for this is to execute NuGet restore before MSBuild began running. This is a <a href=""https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-restore/team-build"" rel=""nofollow"">suggested approach</a> by NuGet.</p>

<p>Now that we are trying to set up continuous integration with our Azure cloud services, as instructed in <a href=""http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso/"" rel=""nofollow"">this MSDN article</a>.</p>

<p>This means that we must now use the <code>TfvcContinuousDeploymentTemplate.12.xml</code> build process template.</p>

<p>But when setting the template to build the <code>build.proj</code> file, the following build error occurs:</p>

<pre><code>Exception Message: Deploying to Azure Cloud Service requires a Visual Studio Solution (.sln) that contains either a ccproj or a lsxproj. (type DeploymentException)
Exception Stack Trace:    at System.Activities.Statements.Throw.Execute(CodeActivityContext context)
   at System.Activities.CodeActivity.InternalExecute(ActivityInstance instance, ActivityExecutor executor, BookmarkManager bookmarkManager)
   at System.Activities.Runtime.ActivityExecutor.ExecuteActivityWorkItem.ExecuteBody(ActivityExecutor executor, BookmarkManager bookmarkManager, Location resultLocation)
</code></pre>

<p>When using the <code>.sln</code>, all works fine.  But we obviously also need NuGet restore to occur before the build.</p>

<p><strong>What is a good solution to have both continuous integration AND NuGet restore working?</strong></p>

Basically, what I need is way of synchronously replication for a column in a table that is updating very fast on production database. Replication must be instanteniously so in case production database goes down all that information (that column) to be ready and updated on backup. That's on one hand. On the other hand performace shouldn't be alterated on production during the replication. The table could have hundreds of thousands of rows, not all of them should be replicated (there are data IN and data OUT - only for data OUT I need that column replicated on backup).
I was thinking to materialized view, triggers and streams.
For triggers things are ... easy but some people say it's not a recomended way. I did a db link and a trigger like that:</p>

<pre><code>after update of column
for each row
update table@backup set column = :NEW.column...
</code></pre>

<p>For materialized view... I don't have yet in mind a solution as I don't know how to actualy update in my backup.table only the last row updated on production.table using the records from materializedview.</p>

<p>For streams.. I'm not familiar with these and I really don't know if I could replicate only changes on a column or, better, replicate entire table and then, on backup, execute some select etc etc.</p>

<p>Any ideas?

<li>Standard's package structure is different from MultiCore's - do I have to correct this manually?</li>
<li>Under standard mvc framework, some code in the constructor of <code>Mediator</code> is allowed, while in MultiCore, this seems to be absolutely forbidden - so do I have to change so many constructors to get rid of this?</li>

<p>I have some doubt about the new annotation <strong>@MatrixVariable</strong> introduced by Spring 3.2 version and the use of the Matrix variables in the URI path.</p>

<p>Within my home.jsp view I have the following link:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a id=""matrixVar"" class=""textLink"" href=""&lt;c:url value=""/data/matrixvars;foo=bar/simple"" /&gt;""&gt;Matrix variable&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Reading here the official documentation about <strong>@MatrixVariable</strong> annotation: <a href=""http://static.springsource.org/spring-framework/docs/3.2.0.M2/reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-ann-matrix-variables"">http://static.springsource.org/spring-framework/docs/3.2.0.M2/reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-ann-matrix-variables</a></p>

<p>I have understand the following thing:</p>

<p>1) Matrix variables are a couple 
2) I can put these variable in any URI path segment</p>

<p>So I have some doubts about the previous link: </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>What is the URI called when I click on the previus link?</strong></p>

<p>Is it /spring-mvc-showcase/data/matrixvars/simple ?!?! (with spring-mvc-showcase that is only the application name)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It would have been indifferent if I had put the ""foo"" matrix variable in some other position?</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>For example if I put the ""foo"" variabile in this way:</p>

<p>""/data;foo=bar/matrixvars/simple"" </p>

<p>or in this way:</p>

<p>""/data/matrixvars/simple;foo=bar""</p>

<p>Has it the same meaning? </p>

<p>Ok, now this is the controller method that handles the HTTP Request generated by clicking the link:</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value=""{path}/simple"", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public @ResponseBody String withMatrixVariable(@PathVariable String path, @MatrixVariable String foo) {
    return ""Obtained matrix variable 'foo="" + foo + ""' from path segment '"" + path + ""'"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>This method use the URI Template pattern to accede to a specific position of the URI.</p>

<p>So if my URI is <strong>data/matrixvars/simple</strong> and because my entire class is annoted by <strong>@RequestMapping(""/data"")</strong> annotation and my controller method is annoted by: <strong>@RequestMapping(value=""{path}/simple"", method=RequestMethod.GET)</strong> that means the following thing?</p>

<p>the path URI Template variable is related to the second URI position (that in the current URI is matrixvars) and so this method can handle also URI like:</p>

<pre><code>/spring-mvc-showcase/data/SOMETHING/simple 
</code></pre>

<p>Is it right?</p>

<p>Thank you very much</p>

<p>I've read loads of questions/answers on here but none seem to do it. I see many have used the .getJSON() method, but using .ajax() should be ok I would have thought?</p>

On top of that, the salt should be different for each user so hackers can't do harm even if they have the encrypted values.</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure what salting means. From my understanding, you hash the password, then you use another value that you hash (the salt) and combine those two together so the algorithm to retrieve the original password is different for every user.</p>

<p>So basically, what I'd have to do is hash a password, then use a different hash on a different value for each user (ie: the user name or email address) and then I can do a simple math operation on those two values to get the encoded password.</p>

<p>Is that correct or did I just not understand anything about password hashing + salting?</p>

<p>A simple explanation or example would prove to be helpful as the sites I've found don't quite explain clearly what salting a password is.</p>

<p><b>Edit:</b> After reading comments and answers left so far, I understand that I didn't really understand what a salt was because I'm missing some key concepts and I was making false assumption.</p>

<p>What I'd like to know is: how do you consistently get the same salt if it is randomly-generated? If the salt is stored in the database like some people have mentioned, then I can see how you keep getting the same salt, but that brings another question: How does it make the passwords more secure if anyone with access to the database have access to the salt? Couldn't they just append the (known) salt to all the passwords they try and the result would be the same (bar some minor time loss) than not having one at all?</p>

<p>Then <code>SELECT LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd');</code> worked fine as well.</p>

<p>When I run that PHP code I get following error:</p>

<p>So the model I'm working with is an <code>Iterable&lt;R&gt;</code>, but unfortunately, <code>TableRowModel</code> has to know the row count up-front.</p>

<p>I can imagine a few strategies which might work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Load all rows, but do it in the background and add them to the model in batches.</li>
<li>Somehow detect requests to render the lower rows (via the model I guess) and dynamically load more rows if this happens.</li>
<li>Have a button on the screen to explicitly load more rows.</li>
<li>Some kind of <code>non-JTable</code> component which supports rendering rows without knowing the row count in advance (ideal, but I can't find one.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I am wondering if there is a ""normal"" way to do this, because it isn't often that I see this sort of thing in a UI. The few <code>JDBC</code> tools I have checked out (I figured these would be the best bet) seem to either eagerly load the results or page them (as a user, I really dislike paging in GUI apps, so I would like to avoid that.)</p>

<p>Operations like ""Find"" over the table should ideally work in an ""understandable"" way though... so it seems like this is not going to be too easy.</p>

<p>where aggregation_content is </p>

<pre><code>{cell:""ProjectOwner"",value:""""},{cell:""ProjectName"",value:""""},{cell:""ProjectLeader"",value:""""},{cell:""ProjectType"",value:""""}
</code></pre>

<p>and new data is a gridData from the beginning.
this works perfectly for a first aggregation. but the problem is that when i aggregate the array newData i need to use</p>

<pre><code>if(! (n in newData[o]))
    newData[o][n] = [];
 newData[o][n].push(objA);
</code></pre>

<p>and that [o] should be a parent of [n] -node.
ok- second group is ok too with that code, but when i want to make 5 inner groups i need to do it like </p>

<pre><code>newData[""firstGroup""][""secondGroup""][""thirdGroup""]...[n].push(""Some content"").
</code></pre>

<p>how can this be made programaticly? if i do </p>

<pre><code>newData = newData[o] - no good
or
temp = newData
do something to temp
newData[o] = temp not good eather :'(

<pre><code>BOOL (^Block)(Square *square, NSMutableArray *processedSquares) = ^(Square *square, NSMutableArray *processedSquares) {
    [processedSquares addObject:square];

    if (square.nuked) {
        return YES; // Found a nuked square, immediately return
    }

    for (Square *adjacentSquare in square.adjacentSquares) {

        if (Block(adjacentSquare, processedSquares)) {

        }
    }

    return NO;
};

__block NSMutableArray *processedSquares = [NSMutableArray array];
BOOL foundNukedSquare = Block(square, processedSquares);
</code></pre>

<p>Explanation: I have a <code>Square</code> class that has a BOOL <code>nuked</code>. It also has an NSArray <code>adjacentSquares</code> containing other Squares.</p>

<p>I want to check whether a square, or one of its 'connected' squares, is nuked or not. </p>

<p>The array <code>processedSquares</code> is to keep track of the squares I have checked to prevent infinite recursion.</p>

<p>When I run this, it's doing a lot of calls of this block (as expected). But at some point, it crashes at the last line with a bad access exception.</p>

<p>I also get this in the console:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cannot access memory at address 0x1<br>
  Cannot access memory at address 0x1<br>
  Cannot access memory at address 0x1<br>
  Cannot access memory at address 0x1<br>
  warning: Cancelling call - objc code on the current thread's stack makes this unsafe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not that familiar with blocks and recursion. Any ideas?</p>

<pre><code>table {

     border-collapse: collapse;
     table-layout: fixed;
}

th, td {
    border-bottom: 1px solid black;

    margin: 0;
}

.wrapper {
    background-color: green;

}

.abs {
    position: absolute;

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/b1j2gbn3/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">FIDDLE</a></strong></p>

<p>As you can see, there is a gap between the wrapper div and the top of the containing table-cell. This gap will vanish if I change the <code>abs</code> element to <code>position:relative</code>.</p>

<p>So where does this gap come from and how do I prevent it?</p>

"3488769","1","","","2010-08-15 18:56:47","","3","84","<p>this is more of a design question: </p>

<p>lets say that I have some internal type definitions that I absolutely want to keep secret (not exposed to my service consumers. However, i do need to exchange data with the service users. some of the types I want to share with the users are exactly the same as the internal ones while others are a simplified version of the internal type. same object or not - my primary concern is that the internal object will never be exposed to the outside world, my secondary concern is now making too much duplicate code... </p>

<p>The Idea is that I really don't want to have the situation where the internal object will be exposed to the WCF by mistake(this has just happened to me for internal object not even marked as <strong>[DataContract]</strong> ), so I thought about the following approach: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Design My <strong>WCF service contracts</strong> files not having any reference to the internal types namespace. - this will provide some better safety. </p></li>
<li><p>Implement translations between the internal types and its corresponding public representation objects at the <strong>service implementation code</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is this the right approach? are there any known patterns that better solve the above issues? </p>

<p>I'm not sure because, except for polymorphism and runtime virtual functions, I can declare a pointer to a member function even without an object and this implies that the code functions are shared among multiple classes (although they require a *this pointer to work properly)</p>

<p>But what about the variables? How come I can declare a pointer to a member variable even without an object instance? Of course I need one to use it, but the fact that I can declare a pointer without an object makes me think a class object in memory represents its variables with pointers to other memory regions.</p>

<pre><code>collection_name = ""prodresultlistCollection_%s_%s"" %(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
my_collection = mydb[collection_name]

parameter = ""IP addr""
ip = ""10.20.30.40""
count1 = my_collection.count({ '$and': [{parameter:'%s' %(ip)}]})
</code></pre>

<p>Here the <code>count1</code> shows the number of rows that have the given <code>ip</code> value. This <code>count1</code> query only counts the number of rows where <code>ip == IP addr</code>. But in the database the <code>IP addr</code> attribute can have one or more IP in the format below,</p>

<pre><code>10.20.30.40
10.20.30.40,20.35.45.55
10.20.30.40,20.35.45.55,10.10.10.10
etc...
</code></pre>

<p>Consider the <code>IP addr</code> value in database is <code>10.20.30.40,20.35.45.55</code>, then whatever pattern of <code>ip</code> is given the query should retrieve this row.</p>

<pre><code>ip = 10
ip = 10.20
ip = 10.20.30
ip = 10.20.30.40
ip = 20
ip = 20.35
ip = 20.35.45
ip = 20.35.45.55
</code></pre>

<p>In all the above cases of <code>ip</code> given to the <code>count1</code> query, that specific row in database with the <code>IP addr</code> value of <code>10.20.30.40,20.35.45.55</code> should be retrieved. I tried to solve the problem using regular expressions as given below but it shows Syntax Error in pymongo and in some cases no rows are retrieved.</p>

<pre><code>count1 = my_collection.count({ '$and': [{parameter:/'%s'/ %(ip)}]})
count1 = my_collection.count({ '$and': [{parameter:'/%s/' %(ip)}]})
count1 = my_collection.count({ '$and': [{parameter:/%s/ %(ip)}]})
</code></pre>

<p>Then i tried to match the IP pattern using regular expression using the code below:</p>

<pre><code>import re

IP = raw_input(""Enter the IP: "")
S = IP.split(""."")
IP_DB = ""10.20.30.40,20.35.45.55""

if len(S)==4:
    obj = re.search(r""^\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}$"",IP_DB)
elif len(S)==3:
    obj = re.search(r""^\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}"",IP_DB)
elif len(S)==2:
    obj = re.search(r""^\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}"",IP_DB)
elif len(S)==1:
    obj = re.search(r""^\d{1,3}"",IP_DB)
else:
    print ""Invalid IP!!!""

if obj:
    print obj.group()
else:
    print ""Nothing found!!!""
</code></pre>

<p>But the problem here is, it only compares the pattern of the IP and not the values. For any value of IP given in the pattern <code>xx.xx.xx.xx</code>, this code returns <code>true</code> for matching/searching result. Also the 2nd part of the IP is not considered here. Is there a better way to solve this problem? I need to retrieve rows from the mongodb database using <code>ip</code> in such a way that any pattern of <code>ip</code> given matches the <code>IP addr</code> in the database. What kind of syntax or regular expression should be given in the <code>count1</code> query to achieve this?</p>

<p>I tried replaceChild(""HELLO"", $testTagNode);  to replace the nodes with a string, which I could then (if needed) process further with a simple search-replace, but I only run into the ""not a blessed reference"" error. (I feel like that would have been pretty dirty if it actually worked that way.)</p>

<p>If I try to run a simple search-replace directly on the parent node like this</p>

<pre><code>$error=~s/\&lt;/HELLO/g;
</code></pre>

<p>it will simply never trigger (no matter if I escape the &lt; or not), because LibXML seems to ignore every tag that I don't specifically ask for; if I try to print out the second Error it will also give me just</p>

<pre><code>some text with a node in between
</code></pre>

<p>which is actually a very nice functionality for the rest of the file, but not in this instance.</p>

<p>I can however do</p>

<pre><code>$error-&gt;removeChild($testTagNode);
</code></pre>

<p>which shows me that it actually does get found, but doesn't help me further. I could theoretically remove the node, save the content, and then just insert the content back into the parent; the problem being that it needs to be at the exact location where it was before. The only thing that I could probably do is read in the entire file as a string, let the basic search-replace run over it BEFORE feeding it into LibXML, but that could create a pretty big overhead and isn't really a nice solution.</p>

<p>I feel like I'm overlooking something substantial, as this looks like a pretty basic tasks to do, but I can't seem to find anything. Maybe I'm just looking in the wrong direction, and there is a completely different approach available. Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Your PHP installation does not support PostgreSQL. You need to recompile PHP using the --with-pgsql configure option.</p>

<p>I already did the following:</p>

  2. Find php.ini file, in C: \ xampp \ php \ php.ini, 
  then look for the line "" ; extension = php_pgsql.dll ""remove tag ';' it so that the 
  result was"" extension = php_pgsql.dll ""
</code></pre>

<p>(although I found php.ini- production and development so I uncomment them both)</p>

<pre><code>//in main
ObjectMapper jsonMapper = new ObjectMapper();
String json = ""{\""id\"": 1}"";
try {
    Q q = jsonMapper.readValue(json, Q.class);
} catch (JsonMappingException e) {
    System.out.println(e.getCause()); //java.lang.RuntimeException: ex 2
}

//class Q
public class Q {

            new RuntimeException(""ex 1"", 
                new RuntimeException(""ex 2"")));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the code above, I use <code>jsonMapper.readValue(..)</code> to map the String <code>json</code> to an instance of class <code>Q</code> whose the constructor, marked <code>@JsonCreator</code>, throws a chain of <code>RuntimeException</code>: <code>""ex 0"", ""ex 1"", ""ex 2""</code>. When the mapping fail, I expected the line <code>System.out.println(e.getCause());</code> to print out <code>ex 0</code>, but it prints <code>ex 2</code>.</p>

<p>Why Jackson decides to do this and is there a way to configure it so that it doesn't discard my <code>ex 0</code>? I have tried</p>

<pre><code>jsonMapper.configure(DeserializationFeature.WRAP_EXCEPTIONS, false);
</code></pre>

<p>but it doesn't do anything.</p>

On a page load, I have HTML, page title and additional Javascript for the page returned via JSON, and I update the HTML on the main area. I also have an event listener that listens for certain ID's to be clicked on. </p>

<p>The listener is working, </p>

<pre><code>var TabMenu = {
selectedTab: 'main',
showTab: function(pid) { alert(pid); alert($(pid)); 
    $(pid).addClassName('selected'); this.selectedTab = pid;
    $(this.defaultTab).removeClassName('selected');
}};
</code></pre>

<p>After loading, I click on one of the new tabs, and the first ""test"" alert successfully alerts the element's ID, but the second alert ($(pid)) returns null. I can only surmise that the HTML returned by the AJAX request is not being evaluated and added to the DOM, otherwise it would alert [HTMLDivElement] instead of ""null"". </p>

<p>Here is the relevant AJAX call:</p>

<pre><code>        new Ajax.Request(url, {
        onSuccess: function(t) {
            data = t.responseText.evalJSON();
            Page.update(data.html, data.title, data.js);
            Page.destroyLoader();
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the updating function:</p>

<pre><code>update: function(data, title, js) {
    document.title = Global.title + title;
    if (title != """") { $('HEADING').update(title); }
    $('MAIN').update(data);
    if (js != """") {
        var nuJS = new Element('script', { type: 'text/javascript' }).update(js);
        $('MAIN').insert({ top: nuJS });
    }
}

<p>From sources:</p>

<pre><code>@trigger_error('Generating absolute URLs with the Twig asset() function was deprecated in 2.7 and will be removed in 3.0. Please use absolute_url() instead.', E_USER_DEPRECATED);
</code></pre>

<p>So the official way to generate it in a Symfony-3.0 compatible way became:</p>

<pre><code>{{ absolute_url(asset('some/asset.css')) }}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem though is that the <code>HttpFoundationExtension</code> that provides the <code>absolute_url</code> relies on the ""request stack"" which is empty in case of non-http request.</p>

<p>So it returns the original path without any transformations:</p>

<pre><code>    if (!$request = $this-&gt;requestStack-&gt;getMasterRequest()) {
        return $path;
    }

<p>So the question is - how to generate a full url in a CLI-based application?</p>

<p>I did try replacing the two literals with:</p>

<pre><code>CASE WHEN StudyGroup.SDG_ID &gt;= 0 THEN 0 ELSE 0 END AS TRANS_TYPE_ID, 
CASE WHEN StudyGroup.SDG_ID &gt;= 0 THEN 'Financials' ELSE 'Financials' END AS TRANS_TYPE_NAME, 
</code></pre>

<p>and in the GROUP BY:</p>

<pre><code>CASE WHEN StudyGroup.SDG_ID &gt;= 0 THEN 0 ELSE 0 END,
CASE WHEN StudyGroup.SDG_ID &gt;= 0 THEN 'Financials' ELSE 'Financials' END,
</code></pre>

<p>When I first run the page I get the following values</p>

<ul>
<li>OldValue: 287, NewValue: 287</li>
<li>OldValue: 287, NewValue: 0</li>
</ul>

<p>Have I written the directive wrong or is there some better way to do this?</p>

Simple enough.  The trouble is, that main list doesn't seem to update unless I reboot the app.  Totally lost.</p>

It keeps on crashing when i have a blank editText field. 
This bit of code is in the settings of my app and works the data fine but when there is a blank field it crashes the program. 
Here's the code for it. 
Please don't be harsh because it is my 1st android app. So if anyone knows how to solves the blank edit text field problem that would be greatly appreciated! (Any other comments on how to improve the app would be a help to). </p>

<p>Cheers</p>

I'm using .net 4.5 / C# and I try to set Content to a ContentControl after an async function succeeded. 
The main focus of what i want to to in that part of the programm is to switch between an own WPF Loading animation (Usercontrol IsLoading) and a PDF Content (Usercontrol PDFDokument). The PDF is internal loaded &amp; rendered inside the ""PDFDokument"" and works already very well.
If more information is needed, every asking is welcome.
For you to know i would say i'm still at a beginning level of developing. (the first of three years :) )</p>

<pre><code>    public ucPDFDocument PDFDokument = new ucPDFDocument();
    public ucLoading IsLoading = new ucLoading();

    protected async void lstSuchergebnis_DoubleClickItem(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)
    {
        var tempAkte = ((ListViewItem)sender).Content as Akten;

        tbctrlResultPanel.SelectedIndex = 1;
        PDFDokument.IsDataChangeAllowed(false);
        contSwapControls.Content = IsLoading;

        await PDF(tempAkte);
        contSwapControls.Content = PDFDokument; **&lt;-- after executing this line, the ui freezes**

<p>I tried different ways of using that async loading, but nothing solved that problem.</p>

<p>Hope someone got an idea how to solve that :)</p>

<p>what is the best approach to do nearby search for >=5,000,000 rows data (and also can be filter by place category (for example want to search ""petrol station"" nearby) &amp;&amp; filter by keyword), and sort it by distance ASC .</p>

<p>is any tutorial / algorithm  to do that? how the database stucture, may be must be do clustering ? because if we do search in one big table, it will takes time.</p>

<p>note : let's say inside the table has 10 field (placename,address,category,long,lat,etc).
actually, i've try this <a href=""http://www.arubin.org/files/geo_search.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arubin.org/files/geo_search.pdf</a> , but it's still slow.</p>

<p>Now suddenly the customer is saying that they want only users belonging to the same organization to be able to view each others data.</p>

<p>So we came up with this data model: <br/><br/>
<img src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nbzuXQmcHXc/S3WpZkZ_f8I/AAAAAAAAAPo/xfcTDLwf7c8/s320/Test.png"" alt=""user's organization""></p>

<p>So now the question is: How is it best to separate the data?
<br/>This is the only alternative I see:
<br/></p>

<ul>
<li>SQL JOIN on ALL relevant tables (All tables that have data should no always join on Organization)
-- All queries should now add an extra join to Organization, and if the join doesn't exists, we need to create a new foreign key.</li>
</ul>

<p>But I feel an extra join (We have around 20 tables that needs extra join) is quite costly.
<br/>
I hope there are some other best practices or solutions we can consider.</p>

<p>PS: This is a Web application developed using Java/JSF/Seam (but I don't know if that is relevant)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I want to clarify something. My consurn is not security but performance. We have added the foreign key to organization to all relevant tables that has shared data, and we are using user's logged in organization to filter the data.</p>

<p>All I want to know is if this is a good architectural solution (inner join) or if we should do something else (ie: Load all shared data, and filter in memory instead of sql join).</p>

"6883400","1","","","2011-07-30 13:29:11","","1","370","<p>I am writing a simple multithreaded client-server application using sockets, and have a few questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>For the client, is it really necessary to use a separate thread for receiving data from server?</li>
</ol>

<p>Many resources I found use the client object to send data (using dataOutputStream) to the server, while employing a single thread specifically to receive data (using dataInputStream) from the server. This is supposedly because I/O streams are blocking by nature, so a single thread of execution shouldn't be able to send data (or do anything else) while waiting for a server message because the program is blocked until something is received.</p>

<p>However, the client I wrote could do sending and receiving without using a separate thread. The code to receive data (i.e. socket.readUTF()) was put in a while loop, and the code to send data (i.e. socket.writeUTF()) was in the actionPerformed() method (to be triggered when user clicked a button). As far as I can tell, while the user did nothing, program execution remained in the while loop, listening for server message. When the user clicks the button, the actionPerformed() method was triggered, ""interrupting"" the while loop and sending a message. Once done, the program went back to listening. The sending and receiving worked perfectly.</p>

<p>Why then do people use a separate thread?</p>

<ol>
<li>If i decide to use a separate thread for receiving do I need to make the client object a thread as well? Or can I just run the client as an object? I'm asking this because I noticed some people ran the client object as a thread.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not too sure why they did that because as far as I can tell, when you create an object and a thread, they run concurrently (i.e. like two threads would). Since only one object is involved in this case (the client), it shouldn't need to be run as a thread, right? Or am I missing something?</p>

<ol>
<li>Does an object need to acquire the lock in order to access its own method, if that method is synchronized? Here's my situation:</li>
</ol>

<p>My server is implemented as an object. Session threads are created for each client connection. Each session thread calls the server object's handle() method whenever it receives a client request. The handle method is synchronized, and sends return information to the client.</p>

<p>Apart from the handle() method, the server also has some other methods that send information to each client. These methods can be called at any time through the server's GUI (they are not called by the session threads). While the handle() method is running, I DO NOT want these other methods to run because they may interfere with handle() and mess up the sending protocol. In other words, I want the handle method to finish before these other methods are run.</p>

<p>Can I make these methods synchronized in order to prevent the server object from calling them when the handle method is running, and vice versa? Theoretically the server object would need to wait for the handle's lock to be released before it could call them. I'm just not sure if an object (not thread) would need to acquire the lock on its own synchronized method in order to access it. Hence my question.</p>

<p>Sorry for the lack of brevity, but I wanted to be as clear as possible. Explanations and feedback are very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>We have three intersections for 'person_id 1' of four sets

<p>And… we do not know about person_id 2,3,4,5 etc. person_id and preference_id include over 10000 rows.
As you seen I want:
- fast clean way for search intersections in mysql
- get top 10 intersections (person_id 4 most relevant on the assumption of number of positions. Then 2 and 5)
Thank you for attention.</p>

The objects/table contain around 50 columns/fields. On the surface and under minimal load this works fine but I have run into problems on startup of the program where I load all available objects from the table. There is currently around 8500 rows in the table. The loading of these rows takes painfully long, in excess of 5 minutes!. Obviously this isn't right and I must have done something horribly wrong in my Hibernate configuration (or elsewhere). A normal query for all rows using the java.sql.* package takes around 300 ms to retrieve the 8000+ rows which is acceptable, but ideally I would like to keep Hibernate for its mapping functionality.</p>

<p>I have attached the main configuration for Hibernate below. I am happy to provide further configuration/implementation details but I do not want to bloat this question with what may be unnecessary information at this stage.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I was originally using the default connection pool but tried switching to C3P0 in hope that it would help but the loading time of the rows is basically the same regardless of pool.</p>

<p>Obviously I am anything but a Hibernate expert so I would really appreciate some insight to what I am doing wrong. Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong> Object Mapping + Transaction code</p>

<pre><code>&lt;hibernate-mapping&gt;
  &lt;class name=""com.abc.objects.xyz.objectid"" table=""order_log""&gt;
   &lt;id name=""EventId"" type=""long"" column=""event_id"" &gt;
   &lt;generator class=""assigned""/&gt;
  &lt;/id&gt;

  &lt;property name=""ordId""&gt;
    &lt;column name=""order_id""/&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
  &lt;property name=""pxCond""&gt;
    &lt;column name=""px_cond""/&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
...
&lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The mapping is an excerpt but it is straight forward along the same lines as above. The Transaction that queries the table looks like below:</p>

<pre><code>Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
org.hibernate.Transaction transaction = null;
try {
   long t0 = System.currentTimeMillis();
   transaction = session.beginTransaction();
   List&lt;UCOrder&gt; result = session.createQuery(""from UCOrder"").list();
   transaction.commit();
   System.out.println (result.size() + "" rows were retrieved"");
   System.out.println(""Time elapsed: "" + (System.currentTimeMillis()-t0));
} catch (Exception e) {
   transaction.rollback();
   e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
   session.close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also rather straight forward I would like to think?!?. However, the time it takes to retrieve the data is thousandfold compared to the vanilla <code>java.sql.*</code> method illustrated below:</p>

<pre><code>Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection (url, userName, password);
Statement s = conn.createStatement ();
s.executeQuery (""SELECT * FROM order_log"");
ResultSet rs = s.getResultSet ();

<p>In the dictionary compression method, ""for i in list"" is the sequence supplied to the method right ? So it takes 1,2,3,4.. as the keys. My question is why doesn't it take 1 three times ?
