<code>android:targetSdkVersion=""17""</code></p>

<p>To do that, I implemented my own <code>OnGestureListener</code> that re-computes new widths and heights in the function <code>onTouchEvent</code>.</p>

<p>This is my sample (simplified) code:</p>

<pre><code>case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN:
      View v = _myAcitivty.getWindow().getDecorView();
      _width = v.getMeasuredWidth(); 
      _height = v.getMeasuredHeight();
      break;

case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE:
      WindowManager.LayoutParams p = myActivity.getWindow().getAttributes();
      p.width   = _width + changeInX;
      p.height  = _height + xhangeInY;
      p.Gravity = Gravity.NO_GRAVITY; // tried this because I thought gravity was the issue...
      myActivity.getWindow().setAttributes(p);
      break;
</code></pre>

<p>In the main screen, the position of my view changes when re-sizing and I cannot figure out why.</p>

<p>Here is my activity XML</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    xmlns:tools=""http://schemas.android.com/tools""
    android:layout_width=""200dp""
    android:layout_height=""400dp
    android:orientation=""vertical"" &gt;

<p>and activity in manifest is</p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity
    android:name=""com.example.nettranslate.TextSelector""
    android:label=""@string/title_activity_text_selector""
    android:theme=""@style/FloatingWindow""
    android:windowIsFloating=""true""
    android:windowSoftInputMode=""stateAlwaysHidden"" &gt;
&lt;/activity&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When printing the <code>p.x</code> and <code>p.y</code> prior and after the size change, both values are 0 - so the realtive position must be re-computed somewhere, but I was unable to find where and how to disable this.</p>

<p>Here is how to reproduce:</p>

<p>Create a tab navigator (or viewstack, whatever) and add a couple tabs.</p>

<p>On your tab add a show event handler. Inside the event handler call invalidateProperties() and invalidateDisplayList() on one of the children of your tab. Put a break point on the childs commitProperties() and updateDisplayList().  You'll notice that the updateDisplayList() gets called before commitProperties() which results in incorrect behaviour. </p>

<p>I noticed this problem when setting a DataGrid's dataprovider from inside the show handler. Setting the dataProvider causes the grid to invalidate both properties and displayList, updateDisplayList() will get called first, then commitProperties() which will result in the grid not updating the rows. </p>

<p>It appears the root of the problem is that the show event gets dispatched from within LayoutManagers validateDisplayList() loop, so invalidating a child object from within the show handler results in its updateDisplayList() getting called immediately. </p>

<p>I'm aware that I can use callLater() inside the show handler or several other hacky solutions but I would prefer to fix the root of the problem as I dont want to be finding / fixing this issue every time someone uses the show event and bad things happen.  </p>

<p>I'm considering changing UIComponent.setVisible() which dispatches the show event and using callLater() on the dispatchEvent() so the show event wont get dispatched mid validation cycle unless anyone has a better idea.</p>

<p>Heres some code!</p>

<p>This is a custom method I have which I use to validate my drop down lists. (This works fine for simple DDL validation)</p>

                }
            }
        });
    });
</code></pre>

<p>And here are the controls.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;

<p>None of these worked for me.</p>

<p>I think my problem is that the site's Certificate chain is as follows:</p>

<li>Telekom Root CA 2
<ul>
<li>Intermediate A
<ul>
<li>Intermediate B
<ul>
<li>Site's certificate</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>Telekom Root CA 2</em> is included in the Android default keystore (<code>/system/etc/security/cacerts.bks</code>). I checked that on my own phone I use for testing.</p>

<p>Now the question is, which certificates do I have to include in the custom keystore all the instructions tell me to provide? Just the intermediates? Only the site? Both? Do I need the Root certificate as well? Shouldn't the <code>Site's certificate</code> be verified by the chain - I would not need to provide any extra certificates since the root of the chain is trusted.</p>

<p>I would be happy if you could explain to me what is going on and how I could get this to work. Please do not post workarounds which just ignore the Certificates, since this is intended for production and has to be secure.</p>

I'm kind of afraid that since I'm not an ""expert"" PHP programmer that I might be missing something huge, so I would like to give you some information about my application and hopefully you can tell me whether or not that is the case. So here we go:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm using a CMS to handle user authentication, so I don't have to
worry about that. </li>
<li>After discovering PDO shortly after starting work
on my application, I ported all of my code over to using prepared
statements with PDO.</li>
<li>I am escaping all form and database data (even stuff I <em>think</em> is safe) which is being output with <code>htmlentities()</code>.</li>
<li>My application does use a session variable and cookie variable, but the function of both is very unimportant.</li>
<li>I have designed my form processing functions in such a way that it doesn't matter if the form were somehow altered, or submitted from off-server (i.e. I always check the data submitted to ensure it's valid).</li>
<li>I have done my best to make all error messages and exception messages polite but very obscure.</li>
<li>I'm forcing pages with sensitive information (such as the login page) to be served over https.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I first starting writing my application, I didn't know about prepared statements, which is kind of a huge deal. Have I missed anything else?</p>

<p>instead of overloading canEquals method to use instanceOf in every class in the hierarchy( instance of paramenter is a compile time class ).  Why not use isAssignableFrom ( which is resolved dynamically ) in only the top level class. Makes for much concise code and you dont have to overload a third method.</p>

I have it running with shader version 120 but I want to use some modern features so I set the SDL hints to OpenGL 3.2 and convert my shaders to 150. The problem is in version 150, the use of texture2D will prevent the shader from compiling.</p>

<p>Here is the version 120 of the shaders:</p>

<pre><code>const GLchar* vTextSource =
""#version 120\n""
""attribute vec4 coord;""
""varying vec2 texcoord;""
""void main(void) {""
""  gl_Position = vec4(coord.xy, 0, 1);""
""  texcoord = coord.zw;""
""}"";

const GLchar* fTextSource =
""#version 120\n""
""varying vec2 texcoord;""
""uniform sampler2D tex;""
""uniform vec4 color;""
""void main(void) {""
""  gl_FragColor = vec4(1,1,0, texture2D(tex, texcoord).a) * color;""
""}"";
</code></pre>

<p>And this is what I have for version 150. The vertex shader builds but the fragment shader fails unless I remove any uses of texture2D. All the CPU code is the same between them.</p>

<pre><code>const GLchar* vTextSource =
""#version 150 \n""
""in vec4 coord;""
""out vec2 texcoord;""
""void main(void) {""
""  gl_Position = vec4(coord.xy, 0, 1);""
""  texcoord = coord.zw;""
""}"";

const GLchar* fTextSource =
""#version 150\n""
""uniform sampler2D tex;""
""in vec2 texcoord;""
""uniform vec4 color;""
""out vec4 outColor;""
""void main(void) {""
""  outColor = vec4(1,1,1, texture2D(tex, texcoord).a) * color;""
""}"";

<p>Project B uses Project A to save data in a database. When I run these unit tests, everything passes.</p>

<p>Project C uses Project B for integration tests. These tests fails when it finds the @AroundInvoke annotation from Interceptor.</p>

<p>What is going wrong? The interceptor is only in Project B beans.xml.</p>

<p>The exception stacktrace doesn't clear up my mind. It only show a jassist error. Debugging, I found that the problem comes from boostrap.deploybeans() inside Weld. So, I commented the @AroundInvoke in the interceptor class and everything goes fine with tests, but the insert on database. I think that happens because I removed the interceptor that creates transaction for inserts. </p>

<p>The code:</p>

<p>1) There is a project A which defines an annotation and an interceptor for this annotation. Example:</p>

<p>/Annotation/</p>

<pre><code>@InterceptorBinding
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD})
public @interface Transactional {
}
</code></pre>

<p>/Interceptor/</p>

<pre><code>@Interceptor
@Transactional
public class TransactionalInterceptor implements Serializable {
    …
    @AroundInvoke
    public Object intercept(InvocationContext context) throws Exception {
        …
    }
    …
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think this project must have an empty /META-INF/beans.xml.</p>

<p>2) There is another project B that uses the interceptor from project A. Example:</p>

<pre><code>public class ProjectBClass {
    …
    @Transactional
    public void interceptorMethod() {
        …
    }
    …
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I think this project must have a /META-INF/beans.xml that enables the interceptor. Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;beans&gt;
&lt;interceptors&gt;
&lt;class&gt;br.com.company.projecta.TransactionalInterceptor&lt;/class&gt;
&lt;/interceptors&gt;
&lt;/beans&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>3) Finally, there's a project C that uses the method from project B. Example:</p>

<pre><code>public class ProjectCClass {
    …
    private ProjectBClass projectBClass;
    …
    public void testerMethod() {
        …
        this.projectBClass.interceptorMethod();
        …
    }
    …
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure if it must have a /META-INF/beans.xml. </p>

<p>4) In this same project, there is an integration test which tests the method. Example:</p>

<pre><code>public class ProjectCClassTest {
   …
   @Test
   public void test() {
      ProjectCClass projectCClass = new ProjectCClass();
      projectCClass.testerMethod();
      …
      Assert.assertEquals(…);
   }
   …
}

<p>Here is where the function is being used:</p>

I can also use a select if that's an option too.</p>

For example, user press record, every 10 seconds, I want to write to a file, on the 11th second, it'll write to the next file and in the 21th second, it's the same thing.  So when I record 25 seconds word of audio, it'll produce 3 different files.</p>

<p>I've tried this with AVCapture but it produce clicks and pops in the middle.  I've read up on it, it is due to the milliseconds between the read and write operations.

The problem of course is that copying or moving a directory to another volume does not work with the aforementioned functions because they are not recursive.</p>

<p><code>SHFileOperation</code> will not do because this is a console app and I am using the variations that allow for progress display (<code>MoveFileWithProgress</code>/<code>CopyFileEx</code>), and <code>SHFileOperation</code> uses the GUI for displaying progress instead of the console.</p>

<p>I considered using <code>FindNextFile</code>, but even then I could not find any examples of code to recursively <code>(Move|Copy)File</code> with <code>FindNextFile</code> or otherwise—which is kind of baffling since this issue <em>must</em> have come up before.</p>

"31322283","1","","","2015-07-09 15:43:35","","0","16","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>

<p>DataMapper pattern uses data to populate an object it creates.  Who (what object) should be creating the data for the mapper?  </p>

<ul>
<li>Should it be the DataMapper or </li>
<li>Should it be the entity that calls the DataMapper?</li>
</ul>

<p>Note:  if you understand my question as-is, you don't need to read any further and you may skip to Question block below.</p>

<p>But for more, below is a journey of separating concerns, and moving instantiation of a data object from Service to DataMapper, then back to Service.</p>

<p><strong>Longer</strong> </p>

<p>Consider this code -- look at <code>ProductMapper</code> and how it receives data via constructor (and then uses it to populate Product), and also how <code>Service</code> injects the data into the <code>ProductMapper</code>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>class ProductDataMapper
{
    private $data;

    function __construct($data)
    {
        $this-&gt;data = $data;
    }

    function getProduct()
    {
        $product = new Product();
        $product-&gt;setData($this-&gt;data);
        return $product;
    }
}

//class that needs a Product
class Service
{    
    function getProductParams()
    {
        $data = $_POST['data'];
        $product = (new ProductDataMapper($data))-&gt;getProduct();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, <code>Service</code> provides <code>$data</code> for the <code>ProductDataMapper</code> class.  But shouldn't ProductMapper <em>get its own data</em> and not depend on <code>Service</code> to receive its data?</p>

<p>I am thinking of removing <code>$data</code> from constructor and loading data inside <code>ProductDataMapper</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>class ProductDataMapper
{

    function getProduct()
    {
        $product = new Product();

        //this function is in charge of getting its own data
        $data = $_POST['data'];
        $product-&gt;setData($data);
        return $product;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know why for sure, but having $_POST inside the mapper has been seen as mixing of concerns.  As in, if manner of input changes, then mapper depends on POST specifically and will have to be changed.  So, my response is to move out $_POST from mapper and create a <code>DataLoader</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class DataLoader
{

    function getData()
    {
        return htmlspecialchars($_POST['data']);
    }
}

class ProductDataMapper
{

    function getProduct()
    {
        $product = new Product();

        //this function is in charge of getting its own data
        $data = (new DataLoader())-&gt;getData();
        $product-&gt;setData($data);
        return $product;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And we end up with a mapper that really does not depend on much. It really just pulls data, creates, populates product, and returns it. It does not need to be changed if data source changes.  And <code>Service</code> does not have to pass anything to the mapper to get its product, so mapper does not depend on Service for this data.  But now, mapper depends on <code>DataLoader</code>.  We can instead move the DataLoader outside of mapper, into Service, but then we are back to the very first example conceptually - we are now again passing input to the mapper.  Like so:  </p>

<pre><code>class Service
{    
    function getProductParams()
    {
        $data = (new DataLoader())-&gt;getData();
        $product = (new ProductDataMapper($data))-&gt;getProduct();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Where should code <code>$data = ...</code> go?  </p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>ProductMapper</code>? </li>
<li>the <code>Service</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Can you explain direction of dependency and how to think about it?  For example, are the following statements true when I say ""depends on""?</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Service</code> Depends on <code>ProductMapper</code> to get its product (so it can do things with the <code>Product</code>)</li>
<li><code>ProductMapper</code> depends on <code>Service</code> to get its data (so it can populate <code>Product</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bonus Question</strong></p>

<p>If it is the caller of the mapper that is to own creation of data and injecting that data into the mapper, which way does it do so?</p>

<pre><code>$product = (new ProductDataMapper($data))-&gt;getProduct();//mapper creation

<p>Which from all I can find, is correct. The data file contains the numbers from 1 to 9 in each row, separated by a space. An example line would be:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
</code></pre>

<p>But when I run the code, I get the following output:</p>

<pre><code>Starting to read from file

<p>What the heck am I doing wrong?</p>

The DGV lives on a user control <code>GeneralTabPanel</code> which inherits from <code>MainTabPanel</code> which inherits from <code>UserControl</code>. Reason is <code>MainTabPanel</code> contains a virtual function that every inheriting panel must override.</p>

<p>The problem is whenever I look at the <code>GeneralTabPanel</code> in the Designer and I hit Build, <strong>Visual Studio Express 2013</strong> will generate two columns in the Designer and add them to the DGV.</p>

<p><strong>SuperDataGridView</strong></p>

<pre><code>using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace AnyGameEngineEditor {

    public class SuperDataGridView : DataGridView {

        public SuperDataGridView () {
            this.ColumnCount = 2;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>GeneralTabPanel</strong></p>

<pre><code>namespace AnyGameEngineEditor {
    public partial class GeneralTabPanel : MainTabPanel {

        public GeneralTabPanel () {
            InitializeComponent ();
        }

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>MainTabPanel</strong></p>

<pre><code>using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace AnyGameEngineEditor {
    public partial class MainTabPanel : UserControl {
        public MainTabPanel () {

            this.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
        }

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is as barebones as I can get to reproducing the issue on my machine with VS2013 Express. This is how to reproduce (I have not actually tested this on another machine):</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a new Windows Forms project.</li>
<li>Copy these three files into the root folder.</li>
<li>Open up <code>GeneralTabPanel</code> in the designer.</li>
<li>Open up the Designer .cs file for <code>GeneralTabPanel</code>.</li>
<li>Build the project.</li>
<li>There should be two new <code>DataGridViewTextBoxCell</code> variables at the bottom of the .cs file.</li>
<li>Save the project and rebuild, two more variables should now be at the bottom.</li>
<li>Repeat 5-7 until you're convinced something funny is going on.</li>
</ol>

<p>What I found out is that if I comment out the <code>Dock</code> line in <code>MainTabPanel</code>, this doesn't occur.</p>

<p>So ultimately my question is why in the world is this happening?</p>

Each int reflects the index of another object (it doesn't matter what that object is). The point of the class is to represent a connection between the two objects.</p>

<p>The direction of the connection doesn't matter, therefore the equals method should return true regardless of which way round the two ints are in the object E.g.</p>

<pre><code>connectionA = new Connection(1,2);
connectionB = new Connection(1,3);
connectionC = new Connection(2,1);

connectionA.equals(connectionB); // returns false
connectionA.equals(connectionC); // returns true
</code></pre>

<p>Here is what I have (modified from the source code for Integer):</p>

<pre><code>public class Connection {
    // Simple container for two numbers which are connected.
    // Two Connection objects are equal regardless of the order of from and to.

    int from;
    int to;

    public Connection(int from, int to) {
        this.from = from;
        this.to = to;
    }

    // Modifed from Integer source code
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (obj instanceof Connection) {
            Connection connectionObj = (Connection) obj;
            return ((from == connectionObj.from &amp;&amp; to == connectionObj.to) || (from == connectionObj.to &amp;&amp; to == connectionObj.from));
        }
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return from*to;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This does work however my question is: Is there a better way to achieve this?</p>

<p>My main worry is with the hashcode() method will return the same hashcode for any two integers which multiply to equal the same number. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>3*4 = 12
2*6 = 12 // same!
</code></pre>

<p>The documentation, <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode()"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode()</a>, states that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the
  equals(java.lang.Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on
  each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results.
  However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct
  integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of
  hashtables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If anyone can see a simple way of reducing the number of matching hashcodes then I would be appreciative of an answer.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Tim</p>

<p>PS I'm aware that there is a java.sql.Connection which could cause some import annoyances. The object actually has a more specific name in my application but for brevity I shortened it to Connection here.</p>

<p>At the beginning, I naively thought that doing a simple <code>ParseUser.getCurrentUser().getEmail()</code> would have be enough to get the email but it wasn't (quite fascinating when you know that Parse belongs to Facebook). But then, I decided to create a Me request to Graph API directly. It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code> private void makeMeRequest() {

                    public void onCompleted(JSONObject jsonObject, GraphResponse graphResponse) {
                        if (jsonObject != null) {
                            JSONObject userProfile = new JSONObject();
                            Log.d(TAG, jsonObject.toString());
                            try {

                                userProfile.put(""facebookId"", jsonObject.getLong(""id""));
                                userProfile.put(""name"", jsonObject.getString(""name""));

                                if (jsonObject.has(""gender""))

<p>As some good observers could have noticed, that's not my code it comes from another thread/github/gist (made too much tries, cannot remember!). The problem with that is that it returns me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>{""name"":""Laurent Meyer"",""id"":""10205968929559630""}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is pretty nice (better than nothing), but not my email address.</p>

<p>The question is then: did I do some mistake on my code or the problem come from my Facebook settings (another cause could be that I'm using a test version of my FB app)?</p>

<p>The code has been simplified slightly from the original, but contains the same error. At some stage either the error ""timings.out(49621,0x7fff7e684300) malloc: *** error for object 0x7f81ca80c208: incorrect checksum for freed object - object was probably modified after being freed.""  is returned or Segmentation Fault:11. Where the program crashes varies on different runs, but never gets part N = 8192.</p>

<p>I've written a main function to test the code and don't encounter these errors. The main uses the same functions (make_complex_vector etc). A difference I can see is that I don't free any pointers in the main as I only test it for one value of N at a time, but I don't see how this could cause it to crash? I can run the code for much greater values of N than this in the main.</p>

<p>Can anyone see something obviously wrong here? Many thanks</p>

<pre><code>f13 = new Excel_form(this, Convert.ToInt16(words[1].Substring(0, words[1].Length - 1)));
f13.MdiParent = this;
f13.FormClosed += new FormClosedEventHandler(f13_FormClosed);
f13.Show();

<p>And function to send data:</p>

<pre><code>f13.Odebrane(odebrane, ktory_form_pyta);

<p>I want to send data to form chosen by myself. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Form[] children = this.MdiChildren;

<p>It works for WindowState, but not for sending data.
It is possible?</p>

<p>The function WORKS (Thankgod) but whenever I want to clear up (i.e. delete the audio file that is located in the c:) it just hangs and nothing happens...</p>

<p>Below is my code that executes on the formclosing event....</p>

<pre><code>      Private Sub Form1_Close(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.FormClosing
    Dim di As New IO.DirectoryInfo(""c:\"")

    Next
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>As you probably may be able to see from the function I HAVE TRIED TO REMOVE ALL THE STREAMS AND CLOSE THEM SO THE FILE IS NOT BEING ACCESSED</p>

<p>BUT it still hangs and when I try manually delete it... it tells me it is being used by another process (which is my program) - (I use ffmpeg to convert the .wav to .flac file but that does not cause any problems)....</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong...</p>

<p>Have I missed the closing of some stream or something. </p>

<p>By the way the uploadfilename string is c:\record.flac (just for your information - I dont think it will help)</p>

The LinearLayout has a weight sum of 4 and every TextView has a weight of 1 (to make them with evenly width). 
My first problem is that two of the TextViews has a bigger height than the other two and this make them centered but I want them to be top aligned to the LinearLayout so all of the TextViews have a straight line. </p>

<p>My second problem is that one of the strings is longer than the width of the TextView, which makes that TextView go slightly downward (it is not even centered anymore and is outside of the LinearLayout parent, so all of the TextView width is not shown). </p>

<pre><code>        LinearLayout layout = new LinearLayout(context);
        LayoutParams layoutParams = new LayoutParams(LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);
        layout.setLayoutParams(layoutParams);
        layout.setWeightSum(lessons);

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; lessons; i++) {
            TextView text = new TextView(context);
            LayoutParams textParams = new LayoutParams((int) (0 * (context.getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density) + 0.5f),
                    (int) (length[i] * (context.getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density) + 0.5f), 1);
            text.setLayoutParams(textParams);

            System.out.println(length[i]);

            text.setPadding((int) (8 * (context.getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density) + 0.5f), 0, 0, 0);
            text.setTextColor(context.getResources().getColor(R.color.white_text));
            text.setBackgroundColor(context.getResources().getColor(R.color.class.getField(name[i]).getInt(null)));
            text.setTextSize(TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_SP, 16);

So I created a Plane Reservation System and I am able to simulate mutliple users trying to make a reservation and use Synchromization to get the correct output.</p>

<p>Now that it works, I am thinking how this works in the real world. For instance, let us say the application is built on Swing and this is a multi user application. For simplicity let us assume there are only two planes 'AAA' and 'BBB'. This application may be installed in each of the ticket counter agent's computer , the kiosks at the airport and as well as in the computers of different travel agents and all of them accessing the same database.</p>

<p>In this case, each user/computer will have its own instance of Reserve class, Transaction class and Plane class. So there is only one thread/request in the Transaction class and there is no synchronization. </p>

<p>My question is, how will a mutli user application like this Reservation system actually be designed/implemeneted such that all users are accessing one  instance of Transacion class so that synchronization can happen. You can also look at this question as, how can I build a mutli-user game played by different players across different computers. One more example would be a Banking system to make deposits, withdrawals and transfers when the application is running in the ATM as well as the Teller's machine.</p>

This has worked well over the years.  Also, for the last upteen years we've used Windows XP.  Well, we're beginning to migrate to Windows 7.  Well, now one of the users on Windows 7 cannot run the report.  It gives him an error of “Logon failed. Details: [Database Vendor Code: 6]”.  All of the Crystal Reports used in this application use an system ODBC connection.  I've verified, twice, that the system DNS properly authenticates against the SQL Server database.  However, when the user attempts to run any of the reports in the VB6 app, they all give that same error.  The weird thing is we've got another old VB6 app, which also uses Crystal Reports, and that app's reports work fine.  But that app runs against a local Microsoft Access database, not against SQL Server.</p>

<p>So the question is, are there any known issues involving SQL Server, Crystal Reports XI Release 2 and Windows 7?</p>

<p>Something else we just noticed.  On the 2 user machines that are exhibiting this problem, both are 64-bit Windows 7 machines.  So, could it instead be an issue of a 64-bit version of Windows, SQL Server and Crystal Reports XI Release 2?</p>

<p>They will notice that I am using templates in java (<strong><code>&lt;T&gt;</code></strong>) to make this code work with various entities from my database.</p>

<p>Then I pass the sql (in postgresql) code and the entity class.</p>

<p>SQL:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE activity
(
  id integer NOT NULL,
  name text NOT NULL,
  _modified timestamp without time zone,
  _user integer,
  _enable boolean,
)

<p>And class entity</p>

<pre><code>public class activity implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue( strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = ""activity_id_activity_seq"" )

</code></pre>

<p>I need to know is how to add a where clause in the code of the function <strong>findEntity</strong> using methods template.</p>

<p>The where clause of criteria should be matching the column <strong>_Enable</strong>, this column this column mentioned is repeated in 4 tables in my database, so you note that it is better to reuse code in that function.</p>

<p>the problem is, there is a .txt file, that has some information. I want to write a program that uses this information.</p>

<p>the .txt file will be like this:</p>

<pre><code>variable 1: 711   
variable 2: [8 5 6 11]  
variable 3: xyz zyx yyy

<p>the program should read the values from the file and then use them, any idea how to do it ?!!</p>

<p>/<strong>* UPDATE *</strong>/</p>

<p>what should be done is to read from the text file the numerical values, only the numerical values of the variables, and then use these values in the real program.</p>

<p>for example the value of variable 1 is read and put to a variable x, then in the program we may define
int y=7*x ;</p>

<p>I know how to read a file, but what I don't know is how to read specific values of the variables.</p>

<p><strong>Basically the program should read the file, recognize the name of the variable, get the value, and then use it.</strong></p>

I am training the EM models on separate (but correlated) data and the log likelihood values are linked to the absolute values of the data, i.e. when the training values are greater than 100, EM::train returns strongly positive log likelihood values, when the training values are less than one large negative values are returned, my understanding is this doesn't make any sense given the way EM works.
The section of code that trains the models is below, in case I am making any silly mistakes (I am quite new to opencv) std::cout confirms that the values are larger than one when the training values are larger than 100 and smaller than -1 when the training values are less than 1.</p>

<p>My problem is similar to this post:

<p>But I know there's something missing in order to get it on my actual page (since it isn't working) but i'm not really sure how to get it to work.</p>

<p>I tried this.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table class=""events table table-bordered table-striped table-hover""&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
(data)();
&lt;/script&gt;

 &lt;/table&gt;

<p>But not working.  Am i even close?</p>

<pre><code>inputEl.findElement(By.xpath(""ancestor::div[contains(@class, 'x-form-item')]"")).getAttribute(""class"")
</code></pre>

<p>The answer it gives is <code>""x-form-item ""</code> (notice the trailing space).</p>

<p>However, I want ancestors which precisely have the <code>x-form-item</code> class, and not other classes like <code>x-form-item-label</code>.  So I changed the expression as follows:</p>

<pre><code>inputEl.findElement(By.xpath(""ancestor::div[contains(concat(' ', @class, ' '), ' x-form-item ')]"")).getAttribute(""class"")
</code></pre>

<p>However, once this in place, Selenium is unable to find the element.  It gives this error:</p>

<pre><code>org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: Unable to find element with xpath == ancestor::div[contains(concat(' ', @class, ' '), ' x-form-item ')] (WARNING: The server did not provide any stacktrace information)
</code></pre>

<p>At first I thought I had some kind of mistake, so to simplify, I removed the leading/trailing space.  Presumably this is semantically the same as my very first, working query:</p>

<pre><code>inputEl.findElement(By.xpath(""ancestor::div[contains(concat('', @class, ''), 'x-form-item')]"")).getAttribute(""class"")
</code></pre>

<p>However, this also fails:</p>

<pre><code>org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: Unable to find element with xpath == ancestor::div[contains(concat('', @class, ''), 'x-form-item')] (WARNING: The server did not provide any stacktrace information)

<p>So my fundamental question is, why are these two resulting in different strings?</p>

<ul>
<li><code>@class</code></li>
<li><code>concat('', @class, '')</code></li>

<ul>
<li>Source System: XY_Client</li>

<p>The XML files are received to the PI system, for each XML file an internal file is generated to keep track of store_number, and count of xml files.</p>

<p>How it works: suppose if XML_FILE_1 reaches PI, internal file called sequence_gen is created. the file contains the store number present in XML file and count will be initialized to 1.
so first time,</p>

<p><code>sequence_gen file contains Store: 1001 Count:1</code><br>
(after some time interval)If XML_FILE_2 reaches PI, second time,</p>

<p><code>sequence_gen file contains Store: 1001 Count:2</code> 
and so on..</p>

<p>My question is : If 'n' number of files come at the same time to PI system, the 1st file will lock the sequence_gen file. so how will the 2nd file update the value to the sequence_gen file? So how to tackle this problem?  </p>

<p>I thought of creating a thread instance for every call and storing it in a database. and retrieving each instance, performing function, returning result to the xml call and deleting that instance.. Is it possible? How to go forward on this?</p>

<pre><code>applyToTuple fn (a,b) = (fn a, fn b)
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to make this function work in each of the following cases:</p>

<pre><code>(1) applyToTuple length ([1,2,3] ""hello"")
(2) applyToTuple show ((2 :: Double), 'c')
(3) applyToTuple (+5) (10 :: Int, 2.3 :: Float)
</code></pre>

<p>So for <code>length</code> the items in the pair must be <code>Foldable</code>, for show they must be instances of <code>Show</code> etc.</p>

<p>Using <code>RankNTypes</code> I can go some of the way, for example:</p>

<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}
applyToTupleFixed :: (forall t1. f t1 -&gt; c) -&gt; (f a, f b) -&gt; (c, c)
applyToTupleFixed fn (a,b) = (fn a, fn b)
</code></pre>

<p>This allows a function that can work on a general context <code>f</code> to be applied to items in that context. <code>(1)</code> works with this, but the tuple items in <code>(2)</code> and <code>(3)</code> have no context and so they don't work (and anyway, 3 would return different types). I could of course define a context to place items in eg:</p>

<pre><code>data Sh a = Show a =&gt; Sh a
instance Show (Sh a) where show (Sh a) = show a

applyToTuple show (Sh (2 :: Double), Sh 'c')
</code></pre>

<p>to get other examples working. I am just wondering whether it is possible to define such a generic function in Haskell without having to wrap the items in the tuples or give applyToTuple a more specific type signature.</p>

<p>FilterWith is the method I'm calling on the original filter, in the hope of getting back my expression. So, it looks like my inner expression is being evaluated incorrectly when combined with the outer expression. What I'm basically aiming for is (I believe);</p>

<pre><code>x =&gt; x.Collection.Contains( y =&gt; new { 1, 3, 3}.Contains( y.Id));
</code></pre>

<p>If I test the inner filtering separately, it works fine, so I assume it's just how I'm trying to combine the elements, and if I try and use Contains instead of Any or All, I still get the same error. </p>

<p>I've put Entity Framework in the tags, because this is being evaluated as expressions against an entity set, and someone may have experience of doing this.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> Having a night to think about it, I think I have a better question;</p>

<p>How do I build a Where expression, so I can build;</p>

<p>x => x.Collection.Where( y => new[] { 1, 3 }.Contains( y.Id)).Count( ) > 0</p>

You can even use regular expressions for the parameter constraints. However, I'm wondering if it's possible to use regular expressions to handle API versioning where many routes could/should route to the same action.</p>

<p>For example, I'm trying to version my API in the actual URI like this:</p>

<pre><code>/api/v3/SomeResource
</code></pre>

<p>Where v3 indicates that it's version 3 of the API. If I'm on version 3 of my API it is likely that many of the actions have been unchanged throughout all three versions and would hence need to respond to:</p>

<pre><code>/api/v1/SomeResource
/api/v2/SomeResource
/api/v3/SomeResource
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, I would like to just be able to put a regex in my route attribute like this:
[Route(""api/v(1|2|3)/SomeResource"")] but it appears as though it doesn't treat the v(1|2|3) as a regex and instead treats it as a literal. In other words, a request to /api/v1/SomeResource isn't going to this action.</p>

<p>Is it possible to accomplish what I'm trying to accomplish? is there a way to put a regex in my route?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<li><p>Creating another AppDomain and using AppDomain.Load() loads the assembly into a new AppDomain, but it is not possible to check all the types that are in the loaded AppDomain. I can't create anything, unless I know type fully qualified type name, and even then they have to either be Serializable or derive from MarshallByRef. Another AppDomain stuff just works via Proxies so it is harder to create things without having a Contract/Shared Interface, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>MEF also loads assemblies into the current AppDomain, so it is basically doing the same thing.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>I have checked how ILSpy does this, and to no surpirse it uses Mono.Cecil to load/unload the assembly, but then again, it does not create instances of any types, just does the type inspection which is possible going via Mono.Cecil route.</p>

<p>In order to do so, I used UITableViewCell *cell = [self tableView:tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath]; in heightForRowAtIndexPath method. So that it does is, it calls cellForRow and reconfigure the content of my cell and return back to me.</p>

<p>In the XAML below I have MyTextBox which can accept a list of my own additional validationRules, FileNameValidationRule has a ValidPathStr of type PathStr which has a InputPathStr string dependency property.</p>

<p>To test my theory I tried setting the binding of the Text of the MyTextBox to the same binding as the InputPathStr for MyTextBox. The binding of the Text seemed to work (although incorrectly, but it still attempted to resolve the binding) but the binding to InputPathStr gave a 'Framework mentor not found' error. The trace below shows the output, the first chunk being the Text binding and the second chunk being the failed InputPathStr binding.</p>

<p>I expected the bindings to either both work or both fail, how should I alter the binding for InputPathStr to make it work as it does for Text?</p>

<p>Expected : First call openErrorPopup, execute ajax and then return the value dynamically. </p>

<p>Actual : Though openErrorPopup is called, it returns the temp value directly first to the <code>&lt;input .... onclick=...&gt;</code> and then executes the ajax. </p>

<p>I came to know ajax execution will be asynchronous. So I tried OnBegin event of ajax but thats not returning value. Kindly provide some solution on any of these two issues.</p>

<p>Compiling this code with g++ 4.7.0 gives the following error:</p>

<pre><code>foo.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
foo.cpp:12:16: error: ambiguous default type conversion from ‘Bar’
foo.cpp:12:16: error:   candidate conversions include ‘template&lt;class T&gt; Bar::operator T() const’

<p>My understanding is that, since the struct object is being ""switched"" on, the compiler will try to find a conversion function to an integral or enum type. I explicitly provide a public conversion function to the Bar::Baz enum type and would like it to use that.</p>

<p>The confusing part to me is that the compiler also finds the <em>private</em> conversion function and then cannot decide which to use. Why is it even considering the private function? If I add an explicit cast, say <code>switch((int)bar)</code>, then <em>only</em> the private conversion function matches and the compiler rightly complains that it cannot use it since it's private. So, since the private conversion function can't be used in this context, why isn't the choice between the two unambiguous?</p>

<p>Interestingly, I believe (though I'm not 100% sure) this code compiles without error on g++ 4.6.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> As pointed out by James McNellis in the comments, the fact that the private conversion function is templated is also relevant here.</p>

My problem is when I call 'configureForViewSize'. It tries to apply a zoomScale of 0.66 (to show the full view), but it doesn't work.<br>
After setting self.minimumZoomScale = minScale, then I look at the value of self.zoomScale and it's always equals to 1</p>

<pre><code>- (void)displayView:(UIView *)mView
{
    // clear the previous view
    [view removeFromSuperview];
    [view release];
    view = nil;  

    // reset our zoomScale to 1.0 before doing any further calculations
    self.zoomScale = 1.0;

    [self addSubview:mView];

    [self configureForViewSize:mView.frame.size];
}

- (void)configureForViewSize:(CGSize)viewSize 
{
    CGSize boundsSize = [self bounds].size;

    // set up our content size and min/max zoomscale
    CGFloat xScale = boundsSize.width / viewSize.width;    // the scale needed to perfectly fit the image width-wise
    CGFloat yScale = boundsSize.height / viewSize.height;  // the scale needed to perfectly fit the image height-wise
    CGFloat minScale = MIN(xScale, yScale);                 // use minimum of these to allow the image to become fully visible

    // on high resolution screens we have double the pixel density, so we will be seeing every pixel if we limit the
    // maximum zoom scale to 0.5.
    CGFloat maxScale = 1.0 / [[UIScreen mainScreen] scale];

    // don't let minScale exceed maxScale. (If the view is smaller than the screen, we don't want to force it to be zoomed.) 
    if (minScale &gt; maxScale) {
        minScale = maxScale;
    }

    NSLog(@""contentSize %f %f"", viewSize.width, viewSize.height);
    NSLog(@""minScale %f"", minScale);
    NSLog(@""maxScale %f"", maxScale);

    self.contentSize = viewSize;
    self.maximumZoomScale = maxScale;
    self.minimumZoomScale = minScale;
        //--&gt; THIS IS NOT WORKING! =(
    self.zoomScale = minScale;  // start out with the content fully visible 

    NSLog(@""self.zoomScale %f"", self.zoomScale);
}

<p>In my imagination, this proposed lib would take my uploaded image, process it, then spit out a string of what it thinks the image is of.</p>

<p>I make the ES comparison because of how it offers immense power and control in implementing your search solution via a very simple and understandable API.</p>

<p>I'm looking to apply this within specific domains of images, say, something like identifying makes and models of cars.</p>

<p>Open-source / commercial use licensed would be great.</p>

<p>Also, would be great if I could interact with the lib using Python/Javascript, since I'm familiar with those, but if not, whatever, it's just syntax, I can learn a new language.</p>

<p>I understand I'm asking a lot, and if there isn't such a thing right now, perhaps the next closest solution, or an alternative approach might have to work. I would appreciate suggestions for those too. Thanks!</p>

These configurations have a field for the serial number in them as well as a field for a contact (who uses the PC).  The contact field was always manually set and now we have moved to a new naming scheme which means that all the configuration records have been recreated with new names.  We need to update the new records being created with the contact value from the old record, all the records are in the same table called 'Config'</p>

<p>Example;</p>

<p>OLD: <code>machineid.location</code></p>

<p>NEW: <code>location.machineid</code></p>

<p>I have been able to write a SELECT query to select the records that match serial numbers however I'm having a hard time turning it into an UPDATE query so that the 'Contact' field on the new record can be set with the 'Contact' field from the old record.  The current SELECT statement I have is below;</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM Config ta1
JOIN Config ta2 on ta1.Config_ID != ta2.Config_ID
WHERE ta1.Serial_Number = ta2.Serial_Number AND 
(ta1.Serial_Number is not null OR ta1.Serial_Number = ' ') AND
ta1.Config_Name != ta2.Config_Name
</code></pre>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, I have been digging around on here but have not had too much luck.</p>

<p>I'm writing an element with Polymer and I would like to be able to data-bind an unicode into an attribute of an i tag that will be used in the attr() of a css rule content.</p>

<p>CSS :</p>

<pre><code>i::before

&lt;i icon=""&amp;#x{{ code }}""&gt;&lt;/i&gt; // does not works

<p>For some reason, it's not working, the code is well data-binded but the unicode is printed as a string and not interpreted as my icon.</p>

<p>And there is an answer says:</p>

  <p>It is probably done using system alert windows - so the service creates and manages a window that is added to the window manager, which has a custom callback set on it.</p>

I must give it that it was a silly request but this one seems tp me more thoughtful :
Is it possible to restrict replacement within a number of column ? </p>

<p>I found a code with all the line numbered.

"29828608","1","","","2015-04-23 15:56:32","","2","117","<p>I've been fighting with this for a while, and I've narrowed it down to a test puppet manifest which illustrates the problem.</p>

<p>Basically, I'm defining the File resource, then defining a Mount resources to mount an NFS share in that directory. However, looking at the debug output, it would appear that the checking of the directory is triggering a ""refresh"" event, which is in turn causing Puppet to unmount and remount the share. Something in this process causes the directory to be removed, which then causes the remount to fail.</p>

<p>I've checked the /Volumes directory mid-run, before the Mount refresh runs, and it <em>does</em> create the directory, so I can only assume it's the <code>umount</code> command which removes it.</p>

<p>I've tried it with a <code>before</code> dependency on the File resource (shown below) and also using a <code>require</code> dependency on the Mount resource, with the same result.</p>

<p>Example Puppet manifest:</p>

<pre><code>file { ""/Volumes/share"":
  ensure =&gt; directory,
  before =&gt; Mount[""/Volumes/share""]
}

mount {""/Volumes/share"":
  ensure  =&gt; ""mounted"",
  device  =&gt; ""xxxx@yyyy.net:/share"",
  name    =&gt; ""/Volumes/share"",
  atboot  =&gt; true,
  fstype  =&gt; ""nfs"",
  options =&gt; """",
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the <code>--debug</code> output:</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I've found that one of the hosts which was failing just started working, as if by magic. I've collected the reports around which it started working:</p>

<pre><code>//aaaa.yyyy.net//Stage[main]/Osx-common/Mount[/Volumes/share]   Failed to call refresh: Execution of '/sbin/mount -o /Volumes/share' returned 1: mount: realpath /Volumes/share: No such file or directory
//aaaa.yyyy.net//Stage[main]/Osx-common/Mount[/Volumes/share]   Execution of '/sbin/mount -o /Volumes/share' returned 1: mount: realpath /Volumes/share: No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>Then (later):</p>

<pre><code>//aaaa.yyyy.net//Stage[main]/Osx-common/Mount[/Volumes/share]   Could not evaluate: Execution of '/sbin/mount -o /Volumes/share' returned 61: mount_nfs: warning: option ""0"" not known mount_nfs: can't mount /share from zzzz.yyyy.net onto /Volumes/share: Connection refused
</code></pre>

<p>One more failure, later again:</p>

<pre><code>//aaaa.yyyy.net/Puppet  Failed to set owner to '501': No such file or directory - /Volumes/share
//aaaa.yyyy.net//Stage[main]/Osx-common/File[/Volumes/share]/owner  change from root to administrator failed: Failed to set owner to '501': No such file or directory - /Volumes/share

</code></pre>

<p>And finally:</p>

<pre><code>//aaaa.yyyy.net//Stage[main]/Osx-common/File[/Volumes/share]/owner  owner changed 'root' to 'administrator'
//aaaa.yyyy.net//Stage[main]/Osx-common/File[/Volumes/share]/group  group changed 'wheel' to 'administrator'

//aaaa.yyyy.net//Stage[main]/Osx-common/Mount[/Volumes/share]   Triggered 'refresh' from 2 events
</code></pre>

<p>And that's it working. I've no idea why this host is now working properly but the first host is failing as described!</p>

Our CTI application uses the Avaya TAPI driver to communicate with the PBX, I have configured the TAPI driver with the IP address of the PBX, enabled third party mode (I need to see data from all extensions), enabled ACD queues and entered the correct password. I've also turned on debug tracing in the driver. I am using Astice TAPI monitor to check that everything is okay before turning on our application but here is where the problem lies: In Windows only the first extension configured on the switch is displaying in Windows, everything works correctly for this extension and I see call details fine but it does not display any other extensions and this is the exact problem that I have on the customer site.</p>

<p>On my test system, IP Office itself seems to be configured correctly (AFAIK there is not much config to do on the PBX anyway) and the CTI Link Pro license is enabled and displayed as valid and set to never expire. </p>

<p>Does anybody have any idea at all why only the first extension should be displayed?</p>

<p>EDIT: I've since found that this issue only occurs on Windows 7, on Windows XP it is fine. This means that it is highly unlikely that the problem is due to any settings on the PBX. </p>

<p>I have looked around for similar issues and I found some suggestion about adding -Z to the install command. This seems to only change the name of the requested file from zendopcache-7.0.3.tgz to zendopcache-7.0.3.tar but the output remains the same (yes, it still complains that a .tar is not a valid .tgz).</p>

<p>I am running Debian 7 Wheezy with PHP 5.4.4-14+deb7u14</p>

<p>I have seen similar issues reported but none had working answers.</p>

<p>Can someone help?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>However, I am not able to see this work. If I have a folder for values-hdpi my SGS4 looks fine with the 1.5 scale ratio applied from the dimens.xml file located in the values-hdpi. However, whenever I remove the values-hdpi folder from the project to allow Android OS to scale it up to hdpi, the SGS4 just runs mdpi values. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. </p>

{
    var item = new Item();
    viewModel.CopyToItem(item); 

    item.CreatedBy = WebSecurity.CurrentUserName;
    item.CreatedAt = DateTime.Now;

<pre><code>public void UpdateItem(Item item)
{
    item.UpdatedBy = WebSecurity.CurrentUserName;
    item.UpdatedAt = DateTime.Now;

<p>The incorrect date format:</p>

<pre><code>/Date(1395366469723)/

<p>It should be:</p>

For the data layer to have a dependency on validation seems a little backwards. It makes more sense to me for validation to be done in business logic and once the validation is complete then persist the changes. The data layer should be able to rely on the fact that the data is valid.</p>

<p>The second reason I don't really like overriding SavingChanges is that it seems very messy and gets full of code quickly. When you have a complex object graph that method is going to get very messy VERY quickly with a lot of </p>

<pre><code>if (entity is MyType)
{
    //perform MyType validation
}
</code></pre>

<p>Third reason I don't really like this is all the extra validator objects that I would have to pass in the constructor of the object context. I am using a DI framework but it still feels messy.</p>

<p>I suppose I only have this problem because I am letting people use the repositories. I could add a layer of indirection and then they would have to use some sort of DTO. The downside here is it seems like a lot of extra work. Also the constant mapping that would have to take place.</p>

<p>Is there anyway that you could give access to repositories and to do validation without sticking everything into one SavingChanges method?</p>

What I see in the 3D scatter plot are only red points.</p>

<p>Solution: for some reasons (related to the gradient example I copied elsewhere) I set xrange to len-1, which messes everything in the 3D plot.</p>

<p>My strategy so far is to</p>

<pre><code>Open the PDF
copy/paste all
insert into vim and comment out all
Apply regex replacement to it
Manually adjust what remains / un-comment &amp; compile in stages
</code></pre>

<p>The real problem though is that the method of getting the document into vim itself is highly destructive (since at the very least I'm losing information about where each text line is sitting wrt other elements in the document); I'd like to write some perl to actually pre-process the rendered text so I can then work on it within vim with extra information about which parts of the document constitute a given equation.</p>

<p>To do this I need some means of capturing the rendered PDF text (without manually sitting there swiping over it with a mouse) on a line by line basis, and determine where it lies on the page (wrt horizontal or vertical page borders).
So far I can tell which parts were for example centralised since I also end up pasting ""pseudo-carriage returns"" in my document (so if a return happens after just a few characters on a number of contiguous lines I could deduce fairly reliably it was a displayed expression (as opposed to inline)).</p>

<p>I would like to have determined this in position though (I.e. at the point I'm actually capturing the text) - as opposed to trying to make some sense out of whatever junk gets thrown down with a blind copy/paste all.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(tl;dr)</strong> Does anyone know of any tools for this job (mentioned in the title)? (ideally with each line capture I'd like to attach (or have attached) extra data to it). Is there any way to draw inferences about, say, page geometry, from the actual hex data via which the PDF output is generated?</p>

<p>I have a bit of a problem. I want to make a page to print in HTML, and every third table (that's what I wanna print) shall be on a new page. But I can't find any method to make a new page in JS. Right now I've made a div that makes a space on 60px, but when I e.g. remove the adressbar and stuff in the print-promt (Google Chrome) the table that should have been on the next page shows up on the first. What I want is a Javascript that does kind of the same thing I do then I click ""ctr+enter"" in Word (Or just anything that will solbe the problem </p>

<p>Basically the question says it all, I'm making a calculator in c# and I'm stuck on this problem. When digit grouping is hit the numbers get separated by commas, when the user hits the backspace button, the commas act like characters that get deleted.</p>

<p>inputPanelTextBox.Text = inputPanelTextBox.Text.Replace("","", """") I put this piece of code under my backspace click event. The problem is that say the panel has 234,232 and the user presses the backspace button, the comma is gone as well as the 2 on the far right.</p>

<p>What I want to happen is the same way the windows 7 calculator does when the digit grouped menu is checked and the user hits the backspace.</p>

<p>The problem I've run into is that the conversion is fairly processor intensive, so if I run it on the UI thread, everything pauses for 10 seconds or so while it happens. I've tried moving the conversion to a background thread, but that causes some weirdness because some other methods that are dependent on the array of Drawables fire before all the Drawables are complete. I've tried a couple of different things to do a loading animation, but they won't animate while the background process is active.</p>

<p>Here's my relevant code:</p>

<pre><code>//get and resize SVGs
new Thread(new Runnable(){
    public void run(){
       for (int i=0;i&lt;drawablesArray.length;i++){
            SVG vector = SVGParser.getSVGFromResources(getResources(),resourceArray[i]);
            Drawable drawable = new PictureDrawable(vector.resizePicture(height,width); //resize picture is a custom function in SVG-Android
            drawablesArray[i]=drawable;
        }
    }
}).start();

while(drawablesArray[20]==null){
    loadingView.animate().setDuration(100).rotationBy(25);
}
</code></pre>

<p>With that code it will successfully hold off the later methods from firing until the background process completes, but the animation in the <code>while</code> loop will never actually play. I've also tried using an indeterminate <code>ProgressBar</code> for loadingView, both with and without the <code>while</code> loop (altered to not actually do anything), and it will animate up until the background thread starts, at which point it will freeze. </p>

<p>If I take the animation code that's there out of the <code>while</code> loop, the animation will fire <em>after</em> the background thread finishes, not concurrently with the background thread.</p>

<p>How do I keep the animation going while the background thread is running?</p>

Is there a description of this style of documenting objects, methods, properties?</p>

<p>FYI, the idea to ask this question came because I referred a user here on SO to the socket.io documentation and they came back and said that wasn't javascript, did I have a link to the javascript documentation.

I've tried importing using the Image extensions for retina images. The images are supplied using:</p>

<p>I've provided both a standard and a retina image with both the filename.png and the filename@2x.png names.</p>

<pre><code>CGImageCreateWithImageInRect

<p>And specify the rect that I want to create the image within, the image's scale is increased meaning that the main button's resolution is fine, but the image that is returned and superimposed on the button downpress is not the correct resolution, but oddly scaled to twice the pixel density, which looks terrible.</p>

I need this to appear in the format below:</p>

<p>I posted on StackOverflow yesterday to find out how to correctly write the SQL query and ASP.NET C# code for one many-to-many relationship. For simplicity’s sake the info I provided was very much paraphrased and basically contained only half of the loop you see above. However I’ve since failed in my attempt to apply the same principles to the full loop.</p>

<p>The SQL query (which works for the first half of the loop, i.e. to provide the court address details and a list of the specific contact points) looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>string myQuery = 
""SELECT C.court_id, court_name, court_addr1, court_town_name, court_county_name, "" +
""court_country_name, court_addr_pcode, court_addr_dx, court_code, court_note, "" +
""court_contacts_name, court_contacts_no, CCT.court_contact_type_desc "" +      
""FROM court C "" +
""JOIN court_addr CA ON C.court_addr_id = CA.court_addr_id "" +
""JOIN court_town CT ON CA.court_town_id = CT.court_town_id "" +
""JOIN court_county CC ON CT.court_county_id = CC.court_county_id "" +
""JOIN court_country CCO ON CC.court_country_id = CCO.court_country_id "" +
""JOIN court_contacts CCON ON C.court_id = CCON.court_id "" +
""JOIN court_contact_type CCT ON CCON.court_contact_type_id = CCT.court_contact_type_id "" + 
""WHERE C.court_id = '25' "" + 
""ORDER BY C.court_id"";
</code></pre>

<p>Whilst the C# looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (myDataReader.HasRows)
{

    string last_id = string.Empty;

<pre><code>""JOIN court_contacts_general CCG ON C.court_id = CCG.court_id "" +                                  
""JOIN court_contacts_general CCG ON CCT.court_contact_type_id = CCG.court_contact_type_id "" +

<p>Whilst in the C# I’ve added a new string for <strong>court_contact_general_no</strong> and tried creating another if/else loop based on writing the response received from this new variable.</p>

<p>Either way, all I’m getting is a big blank page or the SQL related errors above.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

My problem is, that nginx opens a new session everytime it connects to glassfish and that session is in no way connected to the client. The client itself has an active session on nginx. </p>

<p>Glassfish seems to be aware of the fact, that something is wrong with the way the sessions are being handled. It manipulates links within the application to keep the session intact:
"".../ProxyTest/page2.jsf;jsessionid=4372da9b75a2043875c73b12f998""
It does not do that if I connect directly to the webserver(without the proxy)
This behaviour is totally unacceptable to me, I need that manipulation gone, but still have the session.</p>

<p>I would like to have an individual and persistent session on glassfish for every user that connects to it via the proxy without having to pass the sessionID in the url.</p>

<p>nginx does set the cookie, but the browser does not send it back. I'm assuming the cookie is formatted correctly:</p>

<pre><code>Set-Cookie:""JSESSIONID=84c5e4e43538da045cc1d8f2a629; Path=/ProxyTest; HttpOnly""

<p>The problem is now, that the browser does not send back the cookie, or for some reason it doesn't get throught to the server. On every request the server generates a new session ID. Confirming that is that data stored in a @SessionScoped bean gets lost.</p>

<p>Now i want to allow them to add more pictures. Now i don’t know if i must save it all in the database or save it in folders???? </p>

<p>Reason why i think folders will be better is because there are so much nice articles with fancy silver light kinda features that i can use but all of them only cater for images saved in folders.</p>

<p>And since i am not THAT good its hard for me to change the code to look at the database instead of the examples that uses folders for image retrieval.</p>

<p>I would like to add something like this to my website (browsing through the images).
Any code examples for me on how to do this when images are saved in the database? I am using ASP.NET with VB.net.

I can’t see how the new <a href=""http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtgui/qabstractopenglfunctions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenGL classes</a> are supposed to be useful.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.kdab.com/opengl-in-qt-5-1-part-1/#more-3420"" rel=""nofollow"">There are classes for each version and profile of OpenGL</a>. These classes have explicit methods for all the OpenGL calls supported by each version. Here's a partial list:</p>

<ul>
<li>QOpenGLFunctions_1_0</li>
<li>QOpenGLFunctions_1_1</li>
<li>QOpenGLFunctions_1_2</li>
<li>QOpenGLFunctions_1_3</li>
<li>QOpenGLFunctions_1_4</li>
</ul>

<p>I assume it would be something like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>query the video card and ask which version(s) of OpenGL it supports.</li>
<li>instantiate a copy of the class for the highest version supported using QOpenGLContext::versionFunctions()</li>
</ul>

<p>So how do I write code using this class? I can't predict which object I will get at run time without knowing explicitly what hardware it will run on. The base class contains no methods since they're different for every derived class. I could write a giant switch but that seems a step backward from using QOpenGLFunctions or just getting the function addresses manually.</p>

    int range = 625;
    int movement = 300;
    int damageMin = 44;
    int damageMax = 55;

<p>And from my main window on menu item clic, i am doing it the following way :</p>

<pre><code>case WM_SYSCOMMAND:
        {
            switch (LOWORD(wParam))
            {
                case ID_TEXT_CHAT:

                        thisClass-&gt;m_pTextChat = new TextChat(thisClass-&gt;m_pApp,thisClass);
                    thisClass-&gt;m_pTextChat-&gt;DoDialog();
</code></pre>

<p>So i am using VS2008 and while debugging, the debugger goes inside TextChatDlgProc , but never goes inside WM_INITDIALOG and returns just like that. Hence, the chat window (resource IDD_CHAT_DIALOG) never get displayed. Any pointers towards resolving this problem is greatly appreciated. TIA</p>

I need to retrieve some records which satisfy certain conditions(<strong>include pagination+sorting)</strong> and also get <strong>total count</strong> of records. </p>

<p>Now, I perform next steps:
1. Create $match operator: <em>{ ""$match"" : { ""year"" : ""2012"" , ""author.authorName"" : { ""$regex"" : ""au"" , ""$options"" : ""i""}}}</em> 
2. Added sorting and  *{ ""$sort"" : { ""some_field"" : -1}} , { ""$limit"" : 10} , { ""$skip"" : 0}*</p>

<p>After querying i received expected result: 10 documents with all fields.</p>

<p>For pagination i need to know a total counts of records which satisfy this conditions. in my case 25.</p>

<p>I use next query to get count : <code>{ ""$match"" : { ""year"" : ""2012"" , ""author.authorName"" : { ""$regex"" : ""au"" , ""$options"" : ""i""}}} , { ""$group"" : { ""_id"" : ""$all"" , ""reviewsCount"" : { ""$sum"" : 1}}} ,  { ""$sort"" : { ""some_field"" : -1}} , { ""$limit"" : 10} , { ""$skip"" : 0}</code> </p>

<p>But i don't want to perform <strong>two separate queries</strong>: one for retrieving documents and second for total counts of records which satisfy certain conditions.</p>

<p>I want do it in one <strong>single query</strong> and get result in next format:</p>

<pre><code>{
        ""result"" : [
                {
            ""my_documets"": [
                        {
                        ""_id"" : ObjectId(""512f1f47a411dc06281d98c0""),
                        ""author"" : {
                                ""authorName"" : ""author name1"",
                                ""email"" : ""email1@email.com""
                            }
                        },
                        {
                        ""_id"" : ObjectId(""512f1f47a411dc06281d98c0""),
                        ""author"" : {

                                ""email"" : ""email2@email.com""
                            }
                        }, .......

                    ],
                    ""total"" : 25
                }
        ],
        ""ok"" : 1
}
</code></pre>

<p>I tried modify the group operator :   <code>{ ""$group"" : { ""_id"" : ""$all"" , ""author"" : ""$author""  ""reviewsCount"" : { ""$sum"" : 1}}}</code> 
But in this case I got : ""<strong>exception: the group aggregate field 'author' must be defined as an expression inside an object</strong>"". If add all fields in _id  then reviewsCount always = 1 because all records are different.</p>

<p>Nobody know how it can be implement in single query ? Maybe mongodb has some features or operators for this case? Implementation with using two separate query reduces performance for querying thousand or millions records. In my application it's very critical performance  issue.</p>

<p>I've been working on this all day and haven't been able to find a solution, so thought i'd turn to the stackoverflow community.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9235581/python-xlwt-formula-parse-error"">Python xlwt Formula Parse Error</a></p>

<p>I am using xlwt to write out a XLS file.
One the formula i need to write out is
HLOOKUP(cell value, table array in another XLS, row index, FALSE)
Example: HLOOKUP(R32, reference.xlsx!ref_array, $A$1, FALSE)</p>

<p>When i use xlwt.Formula(HLOOKUP(R32, reference.xlsx!ref_array, $A$1, FALSE)), i get '<strong>can't parse formula</strong>' error message.</p>

<p>I tried simple HLOOKUP formula in which the table_array was in the same xls sheet i am writing out. For such cases i dont get any error.</p>

<p>So it looks like complex HLOOKUP formula with reference to other XLSX sheets are an issue.
As a workaround, instead of doing xlwt.Formula, i wrote out a string instead with = before the formula<br>
'=HLOOKUP(R32, reference.xlsx!ref_array, $A$1, FALSE'<br>
With this i approach dont get the error.</p>

<p>But the generated XLS file doesn't treat the data i wrote out as formula.
It treats it as text.
If i open the generated XLS sheet in Microsoft Excel and delete the leading space before the '=' it gets converted to a formula.</p>

<p>Every time i generate the XLS, i have to do this manual step of editing the xls.</p>

<ol>
<li>I wanted to know if there is a better way to handle this?</li>
<li>Is there a way to configure xlwt.formula from doing any formula parsing?</li>
</ol>

<p>I also get a number of problems when trying to use the github.com website: I also can't create a new repository using the website; the repository name checking takes very long, and after a while a red warning with no message is displayed. Sometimes browsing repos takes forever, and sometimes the main website doesn't even load. If I try to browse the website using a Chrome's incognito window (as in no cookies/cache) it works perfectly for a while(!!!), and after a few minutes stops working again. This is very weird. I can use all other websites (and also push to other git repos hosted in bitbucket for example) normally.</p>

Ie. the user changes the currency from EUR -> USD, or about 13 other currencies.  I have a few other use-cases such as dates but this one is the easiest to explain.  Currency basically just updates a session variable by calling the currency controller and then uses some JS to reload the page, but I'd like to only fetch certain elements of the page (ie that reflect the currency change and nothing else)... </p>

<pre><code>$(""#places_list"").html(""&lt;%= escape_javascript(render :partial =&gt; 'places/list') %&gt;"");
</code></pre>

<p>or if another controller</p>

<pre><code>$(""#locations"").html(""&lt;%= escape_javascript(render :partial =&gt; 'locations/places') %&gt;"");
</code></pre>

<p>but these elements are specific to the current controller, ie rendering a controller specific partial such as a list... (the currency math itself is in a an application helper, so no new logic is going on), and the currency controller is simple a partial loaded by different controllers.  (Locations, Places, etc)</p>

<p>Other than making an action in every controller specific for this purpose, how can I make it behave in a way that I can render elements specific to the current controller, so I can replace them intelligently over js, instead of reloading?  Ie. I can pass in to currency the current controller</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= hidden_field_tag :info, controller.controller_name %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if any of that makes sense, but I hope it does, at least in my own brain if not in anyone else's.</p>

As you may know, code coverage is blue when reached, red when not reached, yellow when partially reached a line of code.</p>

<p>I coded a little mapper that receives a IDataReader and turns into object thanks to reflection.</p>

<pre><code>internal IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; Convert&lt;T&gt;(System.Data.IDataReader dataReader) where T : new()
{
    var columns = this.GetColumns(dataReader); // get a list of column name... not important.
    var result = new List&lt;T&gt;();

    while (dataReader.Read())
    {
        var nuevoObjeto = new T();  // &lt;-- this line is yellow in code coverage.

        foreach (var item in columns)
        {
            var pi = nuevoObjeto.GetType().GetProperty(item);

            pi.SetValue(nuevoObjeto, dataReader[columns.IndexOf(item)]);
        }

        result.Add(nuevoObjeto);
    }

    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the yellow line is not a conditional like IF or WHILE... is just a simple ""new T""
And if you debug this code, debug reaches very well that line, in fact test is green with expected results.</p>

<p>Test performs this steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Fake IDataReader (with nSubstitute)</li>
<li>Only 1 result on the datareader.</li>
<li>T is tested with only one TestClass... like USERTEST.</li>

<li>Make an interface app that links to each of my apps in the app store (too many steps).</li>
<li>Create a big apk file containing all my apps that would drop my apps in a folder on the device and run a script to install them all (not sure if possible).</li>
<li>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Any help very much appreciated.</p>

I am trying to replace the front page posts section of a WP template.  I have the code below running fine on my index.php page (it gets the posts) when the WP theme is set to settings>reading>your latest posts BUT the way the WP theme ""the thinker"" is setup reading is set to static page and the posts are gotten through a blog template page (in same location as the index.php file) which gets the posts from loops in separately included files.  I'd like to keep it set to static for a few reasons.  My question is ""Is there a reason why the code below would only work in an index.php file and not out of a blog-template file which is is in the same location as the index.php file.  I've checked and the the template-parts called in the code are being called.  It seems like there's just no posts to get (which there are).</p>

In this page, I want to dynamically display a Div, which itself gets header and other text dynamically. The text comes from the database. The Div looks somewhat like this and the height can vary depending upon the text it contains.</p>

<p>The table from which this dynamic Div is to be displayed is like this:

<p>It should appear as a set of two(dynamically) as far there is another record available else only one should be displayed.</p>

<p>I attempted this code with a sample Div, but I want to know if there is a smarter way to this:</p>

<pre><code>HtmlGenericControl divBlock = new HtmlGenericControl(""div"");
divBlock.ID = ""Blockdiv"";
divBlock.Attributes[""style""] = ""width: 120px; height: auto; background-color:grey"";
divBlock.InnerHtml = ""&lt;div&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;This is sample Div&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"";

I can see that the student is properly preserved, but the added model validation isn't.</p>

These 6 databases will each contain a macro used to build data bound for a table called <code>DispenseExport</code>. </p>

<p>Originally each of these databases had their own version of this table but now we have to have them all write to the one application - which I've affectionately codednamed <strong>Omega</strong>. </p>

<p>Omega will contain the <code>DispenseExport</code> table that all the others will write to. It will also be the database that calls the macros from the others to write to it. </p>

<p>So - what is the best way to accomplish this? </p>

<p>I already have a sample sub to call a macro from another database (and works) but the problem here is that it opens the database as any normal user would - Omega will sit on a server and needs to bypass this - by possibly using the <strong>SHIFT-KEY</strong> access method, if best?</p>

<p>How do I do that programmatically in VBA, assuming it's the best way to do so? </p>

<p>Here's what I have so far:</p>

Option Explicit

'Sub to call a macro from another database

Debug.Print ""Opening Macro""
    '/x tells the database to run the macro as soon as it is opened
    Call Shell(""msaccess.exe C:\path-to-database\database.mdb /x mcrTestCall"", 0)
Debug.Print ""Completed Macro""

ErrHandler:

    'Create a message box with the error number and description
    MsgBox (""Sorry but error number "" &amp; Err.Number &amp; "" occurred; "" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; Err.Description)
End If

End Sub

<p>So far I've <a href=""http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/485730"" rel=""nofollow"">successfully implemented</a> the tool you would call ""Magic Wand"" in graphic editors like Photoshop: user clicks somewhere on the map (say, on the lake or forest) and script selects whole area covered by same color and creates a polygon for landmark.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/bHJkL.png"" alt=""Pixels marked as boundary after image processing""></p>

<p>Everything works great except that I am using convex hull algorithm to obtain the... well... convex hull :) That is: the polygon connecting the most outer points of the found points cloud.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WCoKh.jpg"" alt=""Automatically created landmark""></p>

<p>But as everyone understand only few landmarks have a convex shape while most of real world objects have a polyline shape with concave areas. On the picture above you can see that the area has few sharp edges and a farmfield in the right bottom corner covered by convex hull -- that's wrong.</p>

<p>I was Googling for suitable algorithm and digging through math papers but still have no luck finding one. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/83593/is-there-an-efficient-algorithm-to-generate-a-2d-concave-hull"">The most popular question</a> about concave hulls here on Stackoverflow refers to Alpha-shapes along with Delaunay triangles. Though I don't understand how to use it in case: all points are connected to each other forming a continuous polyline thus it seems that I cannot find suitable alpha-radius as even circle with radius equal to 1 pixel with be alpha-exposed.</p>

<p>Any ideas how to archive the goal of building a concave hull will be much appreciated! May be I am moving in a wrong direction and need to look at bitmap vectorization algorithms?</p>

<p>For a project I use a module called IfcOpenShell which allow for easy retrieving the data specified in an ifc file. An Ifc file is an express based language to describe building data.</p>

<p>Now I want to retrieve all the relevant material data fit for lighting analyses from an ifc file and convert them to a Radiance format. Radiance is open source lighting analyses software</p>

<p>So far I have written this script:</p>

<pre><code>import ifcopenshell

ifc_file = ifcopenshell.open('Example_A.ifc')

materials = ifc_file.by_type('IfcMaterial')

print 'There are ' + str(len(materials)) + ' different types of  materials in the file:' + '\n'

for x in range(0):
    materials = ifc_file.by_type('IfcMaterial')[x] 
    colour = ifc_file.by_type('IfcColourRgb')[x]
    styles = ifc_file.by_type('IfcStyledItem')[x]
    surfacestyles = ifc_file.by_type('IfcSurfaceStyleRendering')[x]

#DECLARING THE VARIABLES FOR RADIANCE DEFINTION
rad_material = materials.Name
rad_red = colour.Red
rad_green = colour.Green
rad_blue = colour.Blue
rad_specular = surfacestyles.SpecularColour
rad_roughness = 0.1 #&lt;- Roughness is not defined in IFC, the value of 0.1 is  merely put there as an example


print 'RETRIEVES DATA FROM IFC FILE PRINTS THEM ACCORDING TO A RADIANCE READABLE DEFINITION'
print ''

print '#material name: ' + rad_material
print '#material type: ' + 'No definition found in the specified ifc file'
print 'void ' + ' plastic ' + rad_material
print '0'
print '0'
print rad_red , rad_green, rad_blue,rad_specular[0], rad_roughness
</code></pre>

<p>I found there were exactly 100 different materials specified in the ifc file. And when I run this code, it outputs :</p>

<pre><code>There are 100 different types of  materials in the file:

RETRIEVES DATA FROM IFC FILE PRINTS THEM ACCORDING TO A RADIANCE READABLE DEFINITION

#material name: SH_resin Floor
#material type: No definition found in the specified ifc file
void  plastic SH_resin Floor
0
0
1.0 1.0 1.0 0.5 0.1
</code></pre>

<p>This is exactly what I wanted to do, however, when I change:</p>

<pre><code>for x in range(0):
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>for x in range(0,100)
</code></pre>

<p>it only outputs the last material of the range:</p>

<pre><code>There are 100 different types of  materials in the file:

Essentially my JavaScript code passes strings to the Firebreath plugin very quickly (40-100ms between each command), which then forwards those strings to the serial port.</p>

<p>Though everything works, occasionally a string is missed or the serial port freezes and has to be reset. I've verified that it's not the hardware device I'm using and suspect the problem could exist within these functions. Any suggestions for optimizing the speed of receiving the string (something like: ""Sc48E"") from JavaScript, parsing it into a char (unfortunately this is required) and sending it to the serial port?</p>

<p>...and in SerialAPI.cpp:</p>

<pre><code>void SerialAPI::do_multi_send(const std::string&amp; msg) 
{
    bool write_in_progress = !send_msg.empty(); // is there anything currently being written? 
    const char *cMsg = msg.c_str();

    // logging
    FBLOG_TRACE(""do_multi_send()"", ""debug cMsg: "" &lt;&lt; cMsg);

    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
        send_msg.push_back(cMsg[i]); // store in write buffer 
    }

    if (!write_in_progress) // if nothing is currently being written, then start 
    send_multi_start();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the minimal output I get:</p>

<p>Do it seem as though I have everything set up right? </p>

<p>On another note, I can't debug the app for the life of me. I've followed all the steps I can find for debugging Chrome on Windows, have the correct process chosen, breakpoints set, they're actually active in VS2010, yet when I run the app or send the function, they don't hit.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>There are several data QAQC checks and fixes that I would like to perform in the same loop. For example, I wish to remove spaces from entries in the data frame. I can do this easily outside the loop, but struggle with the referencing and name assignments within the loop. Outside of a loop, this command removes all the spaces in the data:  </p>

<pre><code># the function I want to apply to each map immediately after I read it
as.data.frame(apply(get(mymap)@data[],2,function(x)gsub('\\s+', '',x)))  
</code></pre>

<p>This function also works within the loop, but I can't reassign the new no-spaces data to replace the original data. Here is some example code to show what I am trying to do and where I get stuck.  </p>

<pre><code># vector of names from map objects
farmnames &lt;- c(""Gardner"",""Mistletoe"",""Omni"",""Sturgill"")  
library(rgdal)  
# create vector of filenames based on farmnames
filenames &lt;- paste0(farmnames[],""_Farm_Fields_FINAL"")  
# loop to read maps and correct data
for (i in 1:length(farmnames)){  
    name &lt;- farmnames[i]  
    assign(name, readOGR(""."", filenames[i])) # create map object  
    get(name)@data[]&lt;- as.data.frame(apply(get(name)@data[],2,function(x)gsub('\\s+', '',x))) # remove spaces from map dataframe
}  
</code></pre>

<p>But this last line returns the error: ""Error in get(name)@data[] &lt;- as.data.frame(apply(get(name)@data[], 2,: could not find function ""get&lt;-"". I'm guessing that I can't put a function on the left side of an assignment? Because if I just type ""get(name)@data[]"" R returns the correct answer without errors.  </p>

<p>I've also tried various methods creating a temporary dataframe, changing the temporary dataframe, and then using the assign function to replace the dataframe within the map object.  But again, this works outside the loop (assign(mymap@data[],d)) and not within the loop (assign(get(name)@data[],d)).  </p>

<pre><code># method 2
d &lt;- as.data.frame(apply(d,2,function(x)gsub('\\s+', '',x)))  
assign(get(name)@data[],d)  
</code></pre>

<p>But this method returns the error: ""Error in assign(get(name)@data[], d) : invalid first argument"". Presumably because the first argument in assign is supposed to be a single element (variable name), not a dataframe?  </p>

<p>I've also created a subloop to iterate through the variable names making corrections column by column - but this seems very inefficient when I could perform all corrections with a single line in the main loop - if I could just get the assignments to work. I'm hoping someone has a solution for using either of the two examples I pasted above.  </p>

<p>I am not sure how to attach example raw data for an object of class SpatialPolygonsDataFrame within StackOverflow.  If there is not enough information here to help me, I can perhaps create a public folder on GitHub and provide a link?  But I expect this is a pretty basic assignment problem as I am still very new to R and programming.</p>

<p>What I would like, however, is if the <code>Button</code> controls (the gray ones with text in the middle) in the <code>Window</code>'s main <code>Grid</code> had an opacity of 1, totally opaque.  As I inherited this project the opacity was set to 0.75 at the top level, inside the opening <code>Window</code> tag.  Now as I understand this will automatically enforce that on all children and that said children cannot override.</p>

<p>How then can I accomplish the transparent background but opaque buttons?  The only way I have found so far (as a relative novice in WPF) is to have two separate Windows, one which is the transparent background, and the other has no background but contains the opaque controls.  This is terribly hacky though and I want to avoid it if I can.</p>

<p>I can supply code if requested, but it is really as simple as a <code>Window</code> with windowstyle=none and opacity .75 containing a <code>Grid</code>, which contains some very basic <code>Button</code> etc controls.</p>

<p>Has anyone built such a <code>Window</code> before or otherwise have insight into generating one?  Thanks.</p>

<pre><code>def log_error(error)
    puts error.backtrace
    puts ""RECONCILE_TAX_RATES [#{Time.now}] ERROR [#{error.message}]""
  end

<p>I am trying to test it and I cant figure out the syntax for the test.  WHat I had before is: </p>

<pre><code>it 'logs errors' do
    time = ""Tue, 16 Sep 2014 20:18:19 UTC +00:00""
    Timecop.freeze(time) do

<p>Edit:  For anyone with a similar problem the solution I used was: </p>

After the insertion, the db is around 50Mb.</p>

<p>This is how I get the <code>byte[]</code>:</p>

    int id = context.getResources().getIdentifier(filename, ""raw"", context.getPackageName());
    ByteArrayOutputStream blob = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

<p>edit: the problem was, I should not be putting bitmaps into the database, but just the raw (compressed in jpeg format)files. So for reference, here is a correct way of getting a byte[] from a bitmap file, so it's still small in size:</p>

<pre><code>private static byte[] getByteArrayFromRawByFileName(Context context, String filename) throws IOException {
        int id = context.getResources().getIdentifier(filename, ""raw"", context.getPackageName());
        InputStream is = context.getResources().openRawResource(id);
        ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        int bytesRead;
        byte[] b = new byte[1024];
        while ((bytesRead = is.read(b)) != -1) {
            bos.write(b, 0, bytesRead);
        }
        return bos.toByteArray();

So with that in mind, I have a VB.NET search routine, part of which is provided, below, that checks all Text cells in a DataGridView for a given string (inclusive), using a basic set of nested loops to perform the search:</p>

<pre><code>' Search for the first occurrence of the given string
For Each row As DataGridViewRow In dgvMembers.Rows
    ' Skip the new row
    If row.IsNewRow Then Exit For

    ' Loop through all the cells in the current row
    For Each cell As DataGridViewCell In row.Cells
        ' Skip non-text cells
        If cell.GetType IsNot GetType(DataGridViewTextBoxCell) Then Continue For

        ' Search for our matching text
        If cell.Value.ToString.ToUpper.Contains(searchText) Then
            ' Select the cell if we have a match
            dgvMembers.CurrentCell = cell
            WriteMessage(""String '{0}' found."", searchText)
            Exit Sub
        End If
    Next
Next

' If we get to this point, we didn't find anything
WriteMessage(""String '{0}' NOT found."", searchText)
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty straightforward.  Now, my question is: is there a way to replicate this behavior using LINQ?  Basically I would like the query to select (or return) the first DataGridViewCell whose text contains the search string.  I've done some tinkering with sub-queries and the like, but I'm still having trouble wrapping my brain around the concepts (too many years of writing T-SQL, I guess).  </p>

<p>Obviously the nested loop works fine, so this is more of a curiosity, really.  Thanks in advance!  </p>

"3395438","1","3396049","","2010-08-03 10:02:02","","1","1007","<p>I have an application which records statistics. When a user submits their statistics the information is stored and the date/time is recorded as UTC e.g.</p>

<p>In the UK if I recorded figures at <code>03/08/2010 10:30</code> my recorded date/time would be <code>03/08/2010 09:30</code> as we are currently observing DST.</p>

<p>If I was in say Australia, and I recorded my statistics at the same time locally my recorded date/time would be <code>02/08/2010 23:30</code> as I think they are around 10 hours ahead.</p>

<p>My application needs to generate a statistical report at 7am every morning (local time) for everyone. So when it runs it does something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var currentUtc = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-1); // UTC date/time 24 hours from current
</code></pre>

<p>This date (time is ignored) is then used to pull the statistics from the database. Now this is working fine for the UK. It is other international countries I am finding the problems. More specifically Australia.</p>

<p>The issue I have is Australia are 10 hours ahead so my application is being triggered to run at around <code>03/08/2010 22:00</code> UK time to generate a report for <code>04/08/2010 07:00</code> Australia time. So what is happening is something like:</p>

<pre><code>// the date/time at this point would be 03/08/2010 22:00 (UTC 03/08/2010 21:00)
var currentUtc = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-1);
// so currentUtc is set to 02/08/2010 22:00 (which makes sense for UK, but not for Aussie)
</code></pre>

<p>If the above was a report for someone in the UK it means they would receive a report for 02/08/2010 on 03/08/2010 which is correct. However, for Australia (as they are 10 hours ahead) that means they would be receiving a report for 02/08/2010 on 04/08/2010 which would be 2 days behind. </p>

<p>What should be happening is when my application runs at 22:00 hours on 03/08/2010 it should be generating a report for Australia which is <em>for</em> 03/08/2010. However, as per the setup above you can see why this isn't happening.</p>

<p>I can't quite seem to put my finger on this one? I have a feeling it is something to do with my ignoring the time and just relying on the UTC date but I am not sure.</p>

<p>When I run the website, ASP.NET tries to find the xml file in the <em>source</em> path, where the C# file in which name is hard coded is.

<p>It looks like the Cassini web server gets its current directory set by VS, and indeed it is set to the path of my library project.  I'm not sure exactly how VS determines which project to use for the path, but this at least explains what is happening. Thanks Joe.</p>

<p>Logging in used to work as I have an AccountController that does this:</p>

<pre><code>$auth = Auth::attempt(array(
    'username' =&gt; Input::get('username'),
    'password' =&gt; Input::get('password'),
    'active'=&gt;1);
if ($auth) {
     return Redirect::route('home');
}

return Redirect::route('account-sign-in');
</code></pre>

<p>And the home route looks like so:</p>

<pre><code>Route::get('/', array('as'=&gt;'home', 'use'=&gt;'HomeController@show'));
</code></pre>

<p>The app would usually return to home page immediately upon successful login. And in my home.blade.php, I would have an <code>@if(Auth::check())</code> in place to make sure that once a user is logged in, the home page would serve a different set of texts.</p>

<p>Recently however, I noticed that after submitting a request to log in, there's an intermediate page showing a message ""Redirecting to <code>http://localhost.com/</code>"". The message was not there prior to this, and the errors started showing up along with this message.</p>

<p>I looked up all the information I can online, and someone suggested that there were line break/space issues with the source code. I looked at all the source code I had and nothing would've suggested there's something wrong. </p>

<p>Desperate at the time, I removed Redirect::route('home') and replaced that with View::make('home') instead. That stopped the message from showing up, and I'm able to login as usual again.</p>

<p>So I have two questions: 
1) what is causing this odd issue? 
2) is there anything wrong with using View::make() in this case vs Redirect::route()? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>//@@@@ Start of myViewport Plugin @@@@\\
(function($) {

  $.fn.myViewport = function(options) {
    var $opts = $.extend({}, $.fn.myViewport.defaults, options);

    //Plugin Here
    return this.each(function() {           

        alert('Initialising Plugin!' + $opts.privateText + $opts.publicText);
        myPrivateFunction();
    });
  };

  // private functions
  function myPrivateFunction($opts) {
        alert($opts.privateText);
  };

  // public functions
  $.fn.myViewport.myPublicFunction = function() {
        alert($opts.publicText);
  };

  // plugin defaults
  $.fn.myViewport.defaults = {
    privateText: 'This is a text from the privateText defaults',
    publicText: 'This is a text from the publicText defaults'
  };

})(jQuery);

&lt;label class=""error"" for=""postCode""&gt;This field is required&lt;/label&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

<p>I'm using jquery autocomplete to successfully display a list of options in the suburb field:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qNvZ9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You can see its split by comma, so I am then splitting those values up and putting them in their respective fields - ie, ""VIC"" goes to state field, ""3088"" goes to postcode - these work as you can see below, but also as you can see, I cannot get the suburb to set correctly:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VJCij.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So the code in the 'select' of the jquery is ( i wont put the whole thing in for sake of brevity):</p>

<pre><code>messages: {
            noResults: '',
            results: function() {}
        },
        select: function (event, ui) {
            $subpost = ui.item.value.split("", "");

            $(""#postCode"").val($subpost[2]);
            $(""#state"").val($subpost[1]);
            $(""#suburb"").val($subpost[0]);

            //alert('suburb = ' + $subpost[0]);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>So the code is the same for all 3 fields, but for some reason the suburb itself just wont change. 
You can also see the //alert function which correctly displays the suburb by itself but it just wont set in the field ?</p>

<p>There is a method AppOpen(ref bool ShowQuickStart, ref bool Continue); which is executed when the program first opens.  How do a for example pop a message box open during that method without having to implement all of the other methods?</p>

<p>As far as I understand I have to create a ClassLibrary in VS and then mark is as a ComVisible and inherit from the interface and add the GUID attribute and ClassInterfaceType but that is where I get lost.</p>

<p>I know once this is created I have to register the COM object and perform some registry changes for the Program to consume the plugin.  </p>

I have 3 applets for a DDE server/client, the first loads the required files, the second starts the server and the third starts a client to send a command to a desktop app. The 1st and 3rd applets print to a console and the second opens it's own console.</p>

<p>This is causing problems in the form of UnsatisfiedLinkErrors as the native dde client library is being used concurrently. </p>

<p>I know this is not much to go on, but I'm stumped. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
The problem is corrected when I use JS alerts in the JSP page that's home to the applets, see below. </p>

<p>1) index.jsp includes an applet tag for the <code>InstallDDEFiles</code> applet, plugin cached. When <code>InstallDDEFiles</code> applet verifies the required DDE libraries are placed in the JRE, it sets an instance variable <code>installed = true</code>.</p>

<p>2) In $(document).ready, I call the <code>InstallDDEFiles</code> getter for <code>installed</code>, and if true, I add source to an iframe on the page with the applet tag for the <code>DDEServer</code> with <code>document.getElementByID().src = ''</code>. The <code>DDEServer</code> applet is in the same jar as the <code>InstallDDEFiles</code>.</p>

<p>The following results in 2 separate java consoles opening, which leads to <code>UnsatisfiedLinkErrors</code> further along in the process when I try to load the DLLs for DDE. 
Now, if I add an alert() with the results of the <code>InstallDDEFiles.isInstalled()</code> just after it's called, the applets print in the same console, and I don't get the <code>UnsatisfiedLinkErrors</code> I normally get. If I simply log the results of the <code>isInstalled()</code> call, I see the correct value of <code>true</code> but I still get the 2 consoles and still get the link error.</p>

<p>When I launch the Gui project from VS, it works great. When I publish that Gui to the vs add-ins folder and run it, it works fine. When I launch the Gui from the add-in in VS, it loads up fine, but anything that tries to hit the database fails. EF complains about the metadata files.</p>

<p>The only thing I can think of is that the ""res://*/"" portion maps differently when the starting assembly is different, but I've tried using absolute paths to the csdl/msl/ssdl files without any success.</p>

<p>What is different about launching the Gui from an Add-In that breaks the configuration?</p>

"4732262","1","4732909","","2011-01-19 06:09:55","","0","662","<p>I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong, or if this is just a quirk in how everything is processed in MySQL. Here's the setup: (I can't seem to find this exact topic anywhere else)</p>

<p>I have two tables <em><strong>order</strong></em> and <em><strong>menu</strong></em>.</p>

<p><em><strong>menu</strong></em> has an '<em><code>id</code></em>' (for the item), an '<em><code>item</code></em>' and three prices ('<em><code>prc1</code></em>' '<em><code>prc2</code></em>' '<em><code>prc3</code></em>') in each row.</p>

<pre><code>menu +----+----------+------+------+------+
     |'id'|  'item'  |'prc1'|'prc2'|'prc3'|
     +----+----------+------+------+------+
     |  1 | 'tshirt' | 3.00 | 4.50 | 4.00 |
     |  2 | 'socks'  | 1.00 | 2.50 | 2.00 |
     +----+----------+------+------+------+
</code></pre>

<p><em><strong>order</strong></em> also has an item id to match against the order menu, ('<em><code>i_id</code></em>'), and an integer I use for filtering the prices later in php ('<code>prc_id</code>').</p>

<pre><code>order +------+--------+
      |'i_id'|'prc_id'|
      +--------+------+
      |  1   |   1    | # i_id matches id - tshirt and informs to use prc1
      |  2   |   3    | # i_id matchis id - socks and uses prc3
      +--------+------+
</code></pre>

<p>I use JOIN to match the orders up to the items</p>

<pre><code>""SELECT order.prc_id, menu.item, menu.prc1, menu.prc2, menu.prc3
        FROM order 
        LEFT JOIN menu 
        ON order.i_id = menu.id""
</code></pre>

<p>I then get the result back, and initially to make sure everything panned out, I printed the array:</p>

<pre><code>$result = mysql_query($query)
while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result))
    {
        print_r($row);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This is the array I get back (obviously dummy info for the initial tests):</p>

<pre><code>Array 
 ( 
    [0] =&gt; 1 [prc_id] =&gt; 1         #the value (1) for 'prc_id' is given twice
    [1] =&gt; tshirt [item] =&gt; tshirt #the value (tshirt) for 'item' is given twice
    [2] =&gt; 3.00 [prc1] =&gt; 3.00     #the value (3.00) for 'prc1' is given twice
    [3] =&gt; 4.50 [prc2] =&gt; 4.50     #etc
    [4] =&gt; 4.00 [prc3] =&gt; 4.00

    [0] =&gt; 3 [prc_id] =&gt; 3
    [1] =&gt; socks [item] =&gt; socks
    [2] =&gt; 1.00 [prc1] =&gt; 1.00 
    [3] =&gt; 2.50 [prc2] =&gt; 2.50 
    [4] =&gt; 2.00 [prc3] =&gt; 2.00
 )
</code></pre>

<p><strong>So my question</strong>(finally, right? xD)... Why is duplicate data sent back in the array response?</p>

<p>Have I done something wrong? Am I overlooking something? </p>

<p>It's not a huge issue, it doesn't affect my end result, I'd just like to be as precise as possible.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time. :)</p>

<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Form Designer requires a compiled assembly in order to display an inherited form. If the base form class is contained within an assembly that was compiled using the x64 or Itanium options, they cannot be opened by the Form Designer. This is because Visual Studio is a 32-bit process, and cannot execute code in a 64-bit (x64 or Itanium) module.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make sure the base form(s) are defined in an assembly that is compiled using the ""AnyCPU"" build option. This allows form classes defined within the assembly to be used in either a 32-bit process (such as Visual Studio), or in a 64-bit custom process.</p>

It is my understanding that this means that the array is also 32 bytes since a character variable is 1 byte big therefore <code>32 characters * 1 byte = 32 bytes</code>.  The problem is when having a function that has a void pointer that is pointing to an array of characters as described before.  I believe that the code segment</p>

Also tried different syntax for the test.</p>

page.should have_selector('h1', :text =&gt; 'Sample App')
page.should have_selector('title', text: 'Sample App')

<p>My system is Windows 7, and my rails version is 4.0.8 and Ruby version is 1.9.3.</p>

<p>Tried searching around for the ""rack-test requires a rack application, but none was given"" error, and it seems I somehow need to change so that rack is not the default driver.
Well this is how my config file looks like.</p>

<p>I have developed a CUDA kernel which aims to run in a single SM (Multiprocessor) where the threads perform an operation several times (with a loop).</p>

<p>The kernel is prepared to create only a block, therefore to use only one SM.</p>

<p>So if I execute the kernel:</p>

<p><code>time ./simple</code></p>

<p>I get </p>

<p><code>real   0m36.659s
 user   0m4.033s
 sys    0m1.124s</code></p>

<p>Otherwise, If I execute two instances:</p>

<p><code>time ./simple &amp; time ./simple</code></p>

<p>I get for each process: </p>

<p><code>real   1m12.417s
 user   0m29.494s
 sys    0m42.721s</code></p>

<p><code>real   1m12.440s
 user   0m36.387s
 sys    0m8.820s</code></p>

<p>As far as I know, the executions should run concurrently lasting as one (about 36 seconds). However, they last twice the base time. We know that the GPU has 13 SMs, each one should execute one block, thus the kernels only create 1 block.</p>

<p>Are they being executed in the same SM?</p>

<p>Shouldn’t they running concurrently in different SMs?</p>

<p>EDITED</p>

<p>In order to make me clearer I will attached the profiles of the concurrent execution, obtained from nvprof:</p>

<p>Profile, first instance

<p>Now, I would like to show you the behavior of the same scenario but executing concurrently two instances of matrixMul sample:</p>

<p>Profile, first instance
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Unibe.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Unibe.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> </p>

<p>As you can see, in the first scenario, a kernel wait for terminating the other. While, in the second scenario (matrixMul), kernels from both contexts are running at the same time.</p>

<p>I am a mediocerly experienced java developer, and I am seeking to expand my expertise to Servlets and jsp-programming. I am in the process of experimenting with this.</p>

<p>I have gotten help to set up a maven3/eclipse (kepler) work station, and I have successfully gone through a couple of basic tutorials. However, I am experiencing severe difficulties getting external .jar's to work with my code. I have tried several solutions. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>One bullet-proof solution offered online was simply putting my jars in WEB-INF/lib, and importing them through &lt;%@ page import=...
the import works with packages already included, i.e. Math etc. It does not work with external jars, in the lib-folder. Build path is configured like a normal eclipse java project.</p></li>
<li><p>After suspecting that I failed to specify that I was using maven, when searching for a solution, and that it was indeed an important detail, I found a lot of different suggestions in regards to the pom.xml-file. Dependencies and repositories were the buzz-words. I tried a few different copy-paste solutions, but now my project won't even build anymore. Here is my error message when i try to start up the jetty server, and build the project:</p>

<p>So, I have connected to the database using - </p>

<pre><code>$results = $wpdb-&gt;get_results( ""SELECT * FROM wp_myEventDates ORDER BY `StartDate` ASC"" );
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to group the events by the month, so for example there are 10 events in June, then 12 events in July -</p>

<p>I have used a foreach loop and tested several methods to output the date and used var_dump but I am unsure of how to manipulate the results.</p>

<pre><code>$event_id = $myevent-&gt;StartDate;
// var dump from event id gives me 
string(10) ""2013-04-04""

<p>Example two:</p>

<pre><code>$event_id = $myevent-&gt;StartDate;  
$dateArray = getdate(strtotime($event_id));
$mythingmonth = array($dateArray['mon']);
foreach ($mythingmonth as $monthsplit =&gt;$myvalue) {
var_dump($myvalue);
//var dump from myvalue this

}

<p>I have done some reading and the general consensus is to install the gems 'execjs' and 'therubyracer'. 'execjs' installed just fine, however when I tried to install 'therubyracer' I got the following error:</p>

<p>I then did some more reading and found a couple of people said to check that they had the gem 'libv8', which was required for 'therubyracer'. I did that and discovered that I didn't have it, so I then went to install that and got the same error that I did for 'therubyracer'.</p>

<p>I get a small iOS project, which is a weather searching app. Basically it is easy to implement overall, but there are some rules I have to follow:</p>

<p>One parent context on a background thread which is linked to the persistent store (on disk);
one child context on the main thread for the UI;
one child context on a background thread for talking to the web service.</p>

<p>After seeing this, I found an image online:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/eMVVU.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This image shows what exactly should do for this project. And I get few problems right now.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As image shows, I use <code>[[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] initWithConcurrencyType:NSMainQueueConcurrencyType]</code> to define my main UI MOC, and use NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType to define my webMOC and diskMOC. Question is that, shall I put everything into [UIMOC performBlock: ^{......}] ?</p></li>
<li><p>I am quite confused right now, isn't UI runs on main thread? so what is the point of NSMainQueueConcurrencyType?</p></li>
<li><p>After reading lot of documents, I found that the way to share data between childMOC and parentMOC are either make childMOC run ""save"" function, or call merge function through notification.
(a) for the first one, do I need to [childMOC save] then do [parentMOC save]? or after [childMOC save], parentMOC automatically get updated?
(b) I am not sure which way is more appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>The image above have 3 levels MOC. If I do ""save"" function at the lowest level MOC and can highest level MOC get data shared?</p></li>
<li><p>As what I thought about, why couln't the lowest level MOC combined with highest level MOC and to read and write? meantime, the UIMOC in the middle, do I have to put it into performBlock function of Context to run NSFetchedResultController?</p></li>

What I want to do is flicker images of random faces on the die, then end with the face that shows the number rolled. <em>After</em> this happens, I want the function to continue and return the number of the die roll. Here's what I have</p>

<pre><code>public int RollDie()
{
    RollNum = dieRoll.Next(1, 7);
    DispCount = 0;
    Timer Time = new Timer();
    Time.Interval = TimerInterval;
    Time.Tick += DisplayRollHandler;
    Time.Start();
    System.Threading.Thread DispThread = new System.Threading.Thread(Time.Start);
    DispThread.Start();
    DispThread.Join();
    return RollNum;
}
private void DisplayRollHandler(object sender, EventArgs evt)
{
    if (DispCount &lt; TargetDispCount)
    {
        Random Nums = new Random();
        Display.BackgroundImage = Faces[Nums.Next(0, 6)];
        DispCount++;
    }
    else
    {
        ((Timer)sender).Stop();
        Display.BackgroundImage = Faces[RollNum - 1];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>dieRoll</code> is a random object and <code>Display</code> is a Panel. The image flicker works, and it does return the number of the roll consistently. Unfortunately, it doesn't wait for the display flicker to finish before continuing, which is a problem when I have automatic messages that pop up after the die is rolled.</p>

<p>I'm a fairly inexperienced programmer, so I'm probably missing a really basic concept. I know that if I could abstract this into a method call, I can wait for a method call to finish, but I can't figure out how to do that without using a <code>Thread.Sleep</code> call and freezing the program.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>I do not see pagination link on any of the rails_admin index page for models.</p>

<p>There is no error in the log or firebug console.</p>

<p>I do not see any configuration option which affect pagination, except one below</p>

<p>If in <strong>config/initializer/rails_admin.rb</strong> I set:</p>

<p><strong>config.default_items_per_page = 5</strong></p>

<p>It just show 5 records, changing it change the number of item displayed on the page,
but pagination link do not appear.</p>

<p>The strange thing I noticed, that changing <strong>item_per_page</strong>, also change the total count.
I mean, if at bottom of the page it show total record 20(there is 20 record in database), without the above option set.</p>

<p>setting it to 5 as above, also change total count to 5.</p>

<p>To accomplish this I first convert the pojo to a JsonNode with nulls intact to preserve property order, then I follow a path through the structure to set some strings and create nodes as necessary. Finally, I have the ObjectMapper serialize the JsonNode to a string. The logic looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>ObjectMapper nonNullMapper = new ObjectMapper();
nonNullMapper.setSerializationInclusion(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL);

ObjectMapper includeAllMapper = new ObjectMapper();
includeAllMapper.setSerializationInclusion(JsonInclude.Include.ALWAYS);

// NullNodes create stubs to maintain property order
JsonNode node = includeAllMapper.valueToTree(pojoInstance);
insertStrings(node);

String json = nonNullMapper.writeValueAsString(node); 
// Halp, there's still nulls
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I'm aware there's a <code>@JsonInclude</code> annotation so I don't actually need two mappers, but it turns out that I want to serialize the pojo instances without nulls elsewhere, so I can't use it to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Anyway, how can I avoid having the NullNodes serialized into my string of json? I've found two approaches so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Convert to a Map and then serialize to a String, with <code>SerializationFeature.WRITE_NULL_MAP_VALUES</code> disabled. This seems inefficient and hacky.</li>
<li>Remove NullNode instances manually before serializing the JsonNode. Seems like it shouldn't be necessary given the support for excluding nulls for pojos and maps, and it adds (perhaps?) unneeded complexity.</li>
</ol>

<p>I tried registering a <code>JsonSerializer</code> for <code>NullNode</code>, but it doesn't appear to get used. I notice that <code>NullNode</code> itself implements <code>JsonSerializable</code>, which simply delegates to the <code>SerializerProvider</code>'s null value serializer. I hesitate to attempt to overwrite this and I feel like the null filtering should be taking place before the values are serialized, but I didn't dig deep enough to understand exactly how it works.</p>

<p>Is there a better way?</p>

<p>How can I solve this conflict? </p>

<p>p.s. I tried help-> check for updates but it says no updates found!! I am using eclipse from sdk package. (C:\Program Files (x86)\Android SDK\eclipse) </p>

<p>I have eclipse luna installed at other location which I use for Java development. It also has adt plugin installed (latest one)</p>

<p>pps: I have deleted the eclipse folder from location (C:\Program Files (x86)\Android SDK\eclipse)  and replace it with new one from adt bundle and then downloaded adt plugin..
so things are fine now</p>

<p>So I tried this on the client:</p>

<pre><code>        return _client.GetTable&lt;Score&gt;().WithParameters(new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;
        {
            { ""Level"", level.ToString() },

            { ""Friends"", friends.Aggregate(new StringBuilder(), (b, s) =&gt; b.Append(s).Append(',')).ToString() }

        }).ToListAsync();
</code></pre>

<p>Which is weird I only have the option to pass in strings for custom parameters.</p>

<p>So I did this on the server's read:</p>

<pre><code>function read(query, user, request) {

    query.where({ Level: request.parameters.Level, UserId: request.parameters.Friends.split(',') });

    request.execute();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't seem like a comma-delimited list is going to work. I get this error on the server:</p>

<pre><code>Error in script '/table/Score.read.js'. Error: Unsupported literal value chucknorris,bobloblaw,
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: I passed <code>chucknorris</code> and <code>bobloblaw</code> as Facebook ids for a test.</p>

<p>Is there another way to make this work? The ""Level"" value filters just fine if I take out the string delimited stuff.</p>

<p>I'm writing selenium tests in python, and basically my base test class looks like that:</p>

<pre><code>chromedriver = ""../selenium-tests/chromedriver""
os.environ[""webdriver.chrome.driver""] = chromedriver

class TestsFoo(unittest.TestCase):
    base_url = None
    language = None

    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(chromedriver)
        self.verificationErrors = []
        self.accept_next_alert = True
        self.driver.set_window_size(1100, 800)
</code></pre>

<p>Then all of my other test classes extend from that class. Example:</p>

<pre><code>class TestsFooChild(TestsFoo):
    def test_something(self):
        driver = self.driver
        driver.get(""{}{}/myurl.html"".format(
            self.base_url,
            self.language)
        )
        # do stuff

        print driver.current_url
        self.assertTrue(somethingTrue)

    def tearDown(self):
        self.driver.close()
        self.driver.quit()
</code></pre>

<p><code>language</code> and <code>url</code> are defined thanks to this:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    TestsFoo.base_url = os.environ.get('URL')
    TestsFoo.language = os.environ.get('LANGUAGE')
    unittest.main()
</code></pre>

<p>So that's a lot of informations for a very very tiny question:
When doing unittest, if you let a <code>print</code> somewhere, it'll only be printed if the test fails.</p>

<p>Then why in my case, are every <code>print</code>s printed no matter what the result of the test is? I only want to print my <code>current_url</code> when the test fails.</p>

<p>Also, I'm just looking at why it does that. I'm actively working on finding a way to only print it when my test fails. So that part is taken care of. But I'm curious..</p>

        sesion.close();                 
    }
     catch (HibernateException he) {
        FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().addMessage(null, new FacesMessage(FacesMessage.SEVERITY_ERROR, ""Error salvando el USUARIO."", null));
        sesion.getTransaction().rollback();
        sesion.close();
        }    
    }

        sesion.close();
        }    
    }

<p>The 2 Hibernate objects are detached so that's why I merge them.
When I try to execute the above code the User is inserted correctly in the DB.
But when I try to insert the Datosusu this error happens:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""6. Is JavaFX replacing Swing as the new client UI library for Java
  SE? Yes. However, Swing will remain part of the Java SE specification
  for the foreseeable future, and is included in the JRE. On one hand,
  Swing is widely used in existing Java desktop applications, but relies
  on an old architecture, which requires a certain level of expertise
  and specialization. On the other hand, JavaFX features a set of modern
  UI controls that can be skinned using standard CSS techniques. While
  we recommend developers to leverage JavaFX APIs as much as possible
  when building new applications, it is possible to use Swing and JavaFX
  within the same application, allowing developers to extend existing
  Swing applications.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we heard that Oracle donate the JavaFX toolkit to the open source community and  OpenJDK Community had agreed to take it on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The JavaFX toolkit evolved from the F3 project at Sun. Initial
  releases were based around the JavaFX scripting language, however, in
  2011 the toolkit was completely rewritten in Java and released by
  Oracle as JavaFX 2.0. In October 2011 Oracle announced that it would
  donate the JavaFX toolkit to the open source community and by November
  2011 the OpenJDK Community had agreed to take it on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not think so JavaFX is stable. It has no quick support. Document are not enough explanatory. It does not release internal memory when stage is closed. My application is multithreaded application and most of time taken by my application in updating status of each individual thread. Self contained copy of JRE in native bundle does not reliable, we have to replaced it with JRE folder that resides into JDK. </p>

<p>It's really frustrating and I wonder, if JavaFX is fit to develop the Java Desktop application.  </p>

<p>is it the remote compiler or something else? i clicked in start debugging and i got a default simulator view, but i don't see what symbian version is the simulator running, or where or how should i change that?</p>

<p>i want to test and build applications for the Symbian 9.3 edition (3750 ExM models)</p>

FFmpeg's command line interface for doing this is simply <code>ffmpeg -i InputFile OutputFile</code>, but is there a way to make use of it as a library, so I can do something like <code>ffmpeg_convert(InputFile, OutputFile)</code>?</p>

<p>I'm hoping I won't have to use libavcodec directly, as I imagine it will be far more complex than a one-line function to convert between formats. If FFmpeg can't be easily retrofitted to do this, is there perhaps another library based on it that does? I've heard of libvlc, but that seems to only expose a video <em>playing</em> API, not video conversion.</p>

<p>Since i have specified the commit interval as 5 my understanding is that when 5 items are processed by a partition, it will call JDBCItemWriter with a List of 5 Users object to perform a batch JDBC update. However with the current setup, i'm receiving 1 User object at a time during batch update.</p>

<p>Is my understanding above correct or am i missing any step/configuration ?</p>

Each log contains the type (NXDOMAIN, SOA, CNAME, Q, A, AAAA, MX, etc) and the domain name and I am trying to create packets from each log.</p>

<p>I've parsed each log so that through each iteration of the log, the type and domain names that I need to specify are strings, but when creating the packet, we must say something like <code>qtype=A</code>. So then since qtype isn't/doesn't take a string or anything, how do I specify what it is for each packet?</p>

<p>I'm developing a C library which will work both in POSIX and Windows, so instead of using <code>errno</code> and <code>GetLastError/SetLastError</code> I've decided to stick to my own error type. Every my function returns error code as <code>cg_error</code> object, where <code>cg_error</code> is just a typedef. However, for some functions like custom allocators it is still better to use something like <code>errno</code>, but with my own <code>cg_error</code> type.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>AFAIK errno in glibc is implemented this way:</p>

<p><code>#define errno (*__errno_location ())</code></p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>I'm trying to implement a similar function using <code>pthreads</code> on Linux and <code>TlsAlloc</code> and friends for Windows. Here is what I have now (yet only POSIX, seems to be a Solaris implementation from article <em>""Thread-Specific Storage pattern""</em> found on the Web):</p>

<pre><code>cg_error * CG_ERRNO_TLS(void)
{
#if CG_FEATURE_POSIX
  static int once;
  static pthread_key_t key;
  static pthread_mutex_t lock;
  cg_error * error = NULL;
  if (once)
  {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;lock);
    if (once)
    {
      (void) pthread_key_create(&amp;key, cg_free);
      once = 1;
    }
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;lock);
  }
  error = pthread_getspecific(key);
  if (!error)
  {
    error = cg_malloc(sizeof(*error));
    (void) pthread_setspecific(key, error);
  }
  return error;
#endif
}

#define cg_errno (*CG_ERRNO_TLS())
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I try to set or get <code>cg_errno</code>, its int value is <code>6344768</code>, which is not what I want. What am I doing wrong? What's the right way to define something like <code>errno</code>? Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I know that I could use <code>__thread</code> and <code>__declspec(thread)</code>, but such things are compiler-specific (and probably system specific; I've heard that <code>__thread</code> doesn't work e.g. for MacOSX with gcc).</p>

<p><strong>P.P.S.</strong> Base value of <code>cg_error</code> is <code>CG_ERROR_NONE</code>, which is always 0.</p>

<p><br/><br/>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>I changed my code in the form's Load event from:</p>

<pre><code>var colHeadName = new ColumnHeader { Text = Resources.RateRequestForm_RateRequestForm_Load_Billing_Account_Client, Width = 160 };
var colHeadRate = new ColumnHeader { Text = Resources.RateRequestForm_RateRequestForm_Load_RatePlan_ID, Width = 120 };
listViewCustomerBillAccountsClients.Columns.Add(colheadName); //colHeadName);
listViewCustomerBillAccountsClients.Columns.Add(colheadRate); //colHeadRate);
</code></pre>

<p>...to:</p>

<pre><code>ColumnHeader colheadName = new ColumnHeader();
ColumnHeader colheadRate = new ColumnHeader();
listViewCustomerBillAccountsClients.Columns.Add(colheadName); 
listViewCustomerBillAccountsClients.Columns.Add(colheadRate);
</code></pre>

<p>...and it made no difference at all.</p>

<p>It would seem that the ColumnHeader constructor should be able to take a string of what it should display, but even when I do that:</p>

<pre><code>ColumnHeader colheadName = new ColumnHeader(""This"");
ColumnHeader colheadRate = new ColumnHeader(""That"");
</code></pre>

<p>...there is still no change (according to Intellisense or whatever it's called, the string arg is an ImageKey, but I thought I'd try just out of thoroughness/frustration.</p>

<p>I create a Incident through a API to a Ticketsystem.</p>

<pre><code>private void create_Incident(string computer_idn, string swidn_choice, 
string swName_choice, string CI_Number, String windows_user)
{
    string msg_id = """" + computer_idn + ""_"" + swidn_choice + """";
    string username = ""BISS"";

    hajas211ilt3.ILTISAPI api = new hajas211ilt3.ILTISAPI();
    api.BeginInsertIncident(username, """", msg_id, """", """", ""2857"", 
    ""BISS - Software Deployment"", """", """", ""NOT DETERMINED"",
    """", """", """", """", """", """", ""5 - BAU"", ""3 - BAU"", """", 
    ""Interface"", """", """", """", """", """", """", 
    delegate(IAsyncResult r) 
    { InsertIncidentCallback(api, r, username, msg_id); }, null);

}
</code></pre>

<p>This method called as a callback in the create_Incident method.</p>

<pre><code>private void InsertIncidentCallback(server3.ILTISAPI api, IAsyncResult result,
 string username, string msg_id)
{
    api.EndInsertIncident(result, out message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I need the message in a if, but I need the safety, that there is a message. So I have to wait for the InsertIncidentCallback and the message.</p>

<p>In a other Method I ask, if the message is ok:</p>

<pre><code>private void checkIncident(string omputer_idn, string swidn_choice, 
                           string swName_choice, string CI_Number,

    {
        if (message == null)
        {
            string responseXML;
            api.REMEDY_ReadResponseXML(username, out responseXML, out msg_id);
            XDocument doc = XDocument.Parse(responseXML);
            inquiryId = (string)doc.Root.Element(""inquiry_id"");

            if (inquiryId == null || inquiryId == """")
            {
                information_text.Text = ""....."";
            }
            else
            {
                information_remedyID.Visible = true;
                information_remedyID.Text = inquiryId;
                create_LanDesk(computer_idn, swidn_choice, 
                swName_choice, inquiryId);
            }
        }

            information_text.Text = ""...."";

<p>How can I implement a WaitHandle to the Callback? Is the WaitHandle the right option in this case?</p>

<p>The issue is it is sending mails but only sending the first 2, and then displaying a timeout error. Is there any setting that I need to change or is it a problem with my code? Have edited it in many ways but it ends up sending only 2 mails instead of 3. Appreciate any help :) Thanks!</p>

The device has USB video and audio in/out is through 3.5mm Jack. The audio originating from the pcDuino3 mic is very feeble. We tried with standard headset mic as well electret microphone. The result is: very feeble voice level. The microphone recording was tested with Smart Voice recorder and found to be satisfactory. The voice call using Skype on this board was perfect. Voice call between two mobile phone devices using Qmunicate was good.</p>

<p>However, on the pcDuino3, with audio input level was very feeble (one has to keep the mic very close) and he audio is also choppy/distorted.</p>

<p>It looks like something is not all that good with Qumunicate when it runs on pcDuino3. We did try to set the HAL parameters for audio but did not find any improvement. We also tried to set the AudioSource paramters. Even this did not help. It looks liek Qumunicate is handling audio stream differently (using native streams?). </p>

<p>Can someone explain what could be going wrong and how to increase the microphone levels such that the person on the other side can hear the voice properly in a video/voice call?</p>

<p>EDIT: The app uses webRTC and native getUserMedia with native streams.</p>

Everything works fine until we test disrupting the internet connection and then re-enabling the internet connection (the uploader is meant to automatically resume when the internet comes back on).  When the handler tries to re-open the file after the internet connection comes back up the error (""The process cannot access the file"") shows up.</p>

The problem i have is this xml (which i have no control over) has a wierd xml namespace.  I changed it to abc.com just for this example, but its something else.  Anyway, when that namepace is present, the T-SQL returns a null in the result.  So it doesn't play nicely with the namespace.  If I remove the namespace manually or doing a search and replace via T-SQL, it works just fine.  I guess i can just do a search and replace but that solution just bothers me.  Was wondering if anyone else nows a better way around this?  And maybe an explanation of why it doesn't like namespaces?  Would really appreciate some advice.  Thanks!</p>

I utilize AutoLayout to attach the label to its container cell at the top, bottom, trailing and leading edges. In iOS7, the label's height updates dynamically with its content, however in iOS8 it truncates prematurely (usually at 1 line, but sometimes at 2). In iOS8, I have confirmed that the <code>intrinsicContentSize</code> of the label is dynamically updating as expected, but the label's frame is not following suit. Here is the difference seen between iOS7 and iOS8:</p>

<p>I have read of similar bugs in iOS8, but have been unable to implement a workaround. I have tried setting the label's text to <code>@""""</code> and back to <code>@""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter""</code> (as mentioned <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25270918/auto-resizing-tableviewcells-in-ios8-still-truncate-uilabel-text"">in this question</a>), but that does not remedy the issue. Also notice that in iOS8, the cell size does increase according to the label's <code>intrinsicContentSize</code>, but for whatever reason, the height of the label itself does not. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I would be glad to provide more information as well.</p>

I have always used javascript, not jQuery as a rule so am a little unsure of my footing here. Hence needing the snippet initially.</p>

<p>My code performs exactly as expected but it seems I have a memory leak somewhere, and over time (abut 10 minutes) the browser - (IE, chrome and FF) will accrue about 500MB RAM usage. </p>

<p>I cannot fathom why, as there are no queued instructions - as helped by the <code>setTimeout</code> - and no loading images etc. </p>

<p>(The <code>IF</code> statement is to allow me to at some other time - alter the class to my 50 '#z' divs, and turn off animation.)</p>

<p>Anyone know about debugging these kind of issues? It crashes the browser over time so is essentially useless as a production page as is. 
One more thing, FF's online crash reports are flipping awful, there's been no 'dump' after submitting, and the issue is less pronounced on chrome/IE - so no crash reports available. 
Will update as soon as I get something useful.</p>

Basically, I'm doing a microblogging appliation and inserting a tweet when a button is clicked, which calls the jQuery ajax function. Here's the respective code:</p>

<pre><code>home.js
</code></pre>

<p>This is the ajax jquery call</p>

<pre><code>function sendTweet(single_tweet) {
var tweet_text = $(""#compose"").val();

tweet_text = tweet_text.replace(/'/g, ""&amp;#39;"");
tweet_text = tweet_text.replace(/""/g, ""&amp;#34;""); 

var postData = {
    author      :   $(""#username"").text().split(""@"")[1],    // be careful of the @! - @username
    tweet       :   tweet_text,
    date        :   getTimeNow()
};

$.ajax({
    type        :   'POST',
    url         :   '../php/tweet.php', 
    data        :   postData,
    dataType    :   'JSON',
    success     :   function(data) {
        alert(data.status);
    }
})
}
</code></pre>

<p>The ajax call works successfully, and the tweet is inserted, but I can't get the alert call to fireback under the success parameter. I tried something basic like <code>alert('abc');</code> but it didn't work either. </p>

<pre><code>tweet.php
</code></pre>

<p>This is just a wrapper, looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
include 'db_functions.php';

$author = $_POST['author'];
$tweet  = $_POST['tweet'];
$date   = $_POST['date'];

insert_tweet($author, $tweet, $date);

$data = array();
$data['status'] = 'success';
echo json_encode($data);
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This just inserts the tweet into the database, and I wanted to try sending simple JSON formatted data back, but <code>data.status</code> didn't work on the success callback. </p>

<pre><code>db_functions.php
</code></pre>

<p>This is where the insert_tweet function is in, and it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>function insert_tweet($author, $tweet, $date) {
global $link;
$author_ID = get_user_ID($author);
$query =    ""INSERT INTO tweets (`Author ID`, `Tweet`, `Date`) 
            VALUES ('{$author_ID}', '{$tweet}', '{$date}')"";
$result = mysqli_query($link, $query);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tested it, and I'm pretty sure this runs fine. I doubt this is the cause of the problem, but if it is, I'm all ears. I've tested the <code>$link</code>, which is defined in another file included in the top of the <code>db_functions.php</code> file, and this works. </p>

<p>Would appreciate some advice regarding this, thanks!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Changed <code>success</code> to <code>complete</code>, and it works. However, the <code>data</code> object seems a bit odd:</p>

<p><code>data.status</code> pops up 200 in the alert</p>

<p>I tried changing the JSON array element name to <code>data['success']</code> in PHP, and accessed it in the front end with <code>data.success</code>, and it outputted this in the alert box:</p>

<pre><code>function () {
            if ( list ) {
                // First, we save the current length
                var start = list.length;
                (function add( args ) {
                    jQuery.each( args, function( _, arg ) {
                        var type = jQuery.type( arg );
                        if ( type === ""function"" ) {
                            if ( !options.unique || !self.has( arg ) ) {
                                list.push( arg );
                            }
                        } else if ( arg &amp;&amp; arg.length &amp;&amp; type !== ""string"" ) {
                            // Inspect recursively
                            add( arg );
                        }
                    });
                })( arguments );
                // Do we need to add the callbacks to the

                if ( firing ) {

                // With memory, if we're not firing then

                } else if ( memory ) {

<p>In case you're wondering why i would want this, here's a brief explanation of waht i'm trying to achieve.</p>

<p>Basically i have a FreightTable model, that is used to calculate the value of a freight, so it should have method to do this. But the problem is that there are several different ways to calculate it, and each instance of the FreightTable should calculate on its specific way.</p>

<p>At first i thought about solving this using some kind of polymorphism, but then i would have to create an specific model for each different algorithm, and they would also be in different tables in the DB, what would be a problem for me. I also thought about using <a href=""https://django-polymorphic.readthedocs.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Django Polymorphic</a>, but i heard it doesnt really scale well, so it's also not a good idea.</p>

<p>My thought is that if I could just reference this different algorithms on a Model Field, I'll have an ellegant and eficient solution.</p>

I'm not looking for someone to code this for me but just give me some guidance. </p>

<p>The game goes through multiple stages: first a user connects and logins. After he is given the option to host/join a game. After he joins a game or someone joins his game, the client moves on to the game stage. The game is 1v1 and only needs to send data back and forth every 5 seconds (if that's important?). I just need some guidance on how you could design a client/server to move through these ""stages"".</p>

<p>This is how I'm currently thinking of implementing it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When a connection is made the connection will have a corresponding variable that describes state on the server. For example: 0 is before login, 1 is after login, 2 is hosting, etc...</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever the client sends data to the server it checks for the state and deals with it accordingly. Like before login if data is sent, the server will assume it's login details and if they're valid it changes the variable to 1 and tells the client to advance.</p></li>

I have to create a table for each output of letter frequency but I have no idea how to do it. Here is the output I should have to have:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/QtVcI.png"" alt=""output of the exercise""></p>

<p>At the beginning I thought to work on the HTML but I can't as that part is related to test my code has to pass. Here I will show some of them:</p>

<pre><code>display_letter_frequency(letter_frequency(""Hello""),document.getElementById(""frequency_table""));
    var rows = document.getElementById(""frequency_table"").querySelectorAll('tr')
    equal(rows.length, 4, ""With input String 'Hello' there should be 4 table rows"")
    equal(rows[0].querySelectorAll('td')[0].innerHTML, 'H', ""1st td of 1st tr should have the value H"");
    equal(rows[0].querySelectorAll('td')[1].innerHTML, '1', ""2nd td of 1st tr should have the value 1"");
    equal(rows[1].querySelectorAll('td')[0].innerHTML, 'E', ""1st td of 2nd tr should have the value E"");
    equal(rows[1].querySelectorAll('td')[1].innerHTML, '1', ""2nd td of 2nd tr should have the value 1"");
    equal(rows[2].querySelectorAll('td')[0].innerHTML, 'L', ""1st td of 3rd tr should have the value L"");
    equal(rows[2].querySelectorAll('td')[1].innerHTML, '2', ""2nd td of 3rd tr should have the value 2"");
    equal(rows[3].querySelectorAll('td')[0].innerHTML, 'O', ""1st td of 4th tr should have the value O"");
    equal(rows[3].querySelectorAll('td')[1].innerHTML, '1', ""2nd td of 4th tr should have the value 1"");
</code></pre>

<p>Also I cannot use the console.log but write just the code of the function that will be called back by the tester. Here is what I did but I don't know if it's right and how to go forward:</p>

<pre><code>function display_letter_frequency(a,dom) {
if(a === undefined){
    return undefined
} else {
    var tbl     = document.createElement(""table"");
    var tblBody = document.createElement(""tbody"");
    for(var x in a){
        var row = document.createElement(""tr"");

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code is related to a function I wrote before which count in command line the frequency letters of the user:</p>

<pre><code>function letter_frequency(s) {
if(s === undefined){
    return undefined
} else {
    var freq = {};
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; s.length; i++) {
        var character = s.charAt(i).toUpperCase();
        if (freq[character]) {
            freq[character]++;
        } else {
            freq[character] = 1;
        }
    }
}
    return freq;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that the problem is clear and you can help me and the people who will need it. I looked around the web and they talks about some frequency table to define my problem. I don't know if t's right</p>

<p>I try to build a gui to interact with a slqlite database 
   in order to manipulate some distant network configurations on several servers.</p>

<p>So i make three files :</p>

<p>Mygui.py wich contains all pygtk instructions; 
   Mydata.py wich contains all sqlite manipulations 
   and finally Myapp.py wich should conduct the interactions between Mygui and sqlite.</p>

<p>But i don't see how to implement the callback fonctions and their definitions :</p>

<p>with theses lines in Myapp.py :</p>

<pre><code> class Myapp():
   def __init__():
      self.data = Mydata()
      self.gui = Mygui()
</code></pre>

<p>...</p>

<p>and with lines like these in Mygui.py :</p>

<pre><code> class Mygui():
   def __init__():
</code></pre>

<p>...
           self.Base_menu = gtk.Menu()
           self.contenu_item = gtk.MenuItem('contenu base"")
           self.Base_menu.append( self.contenu_item )
... # others </p>

<pre><code>       self.contenu_item(""activate"", contenu_callback )
</code></pre>

<p>i think ( probably false ) that ""contenu_callback"" 
should be in Myapp.py has it connect the database with the display 
but i don t understand how to ?</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>(edit after 5 minutes )
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks for the answer but i'm not sure if i understand correctly :
So what i understand from your last line is that in the module ""MyGui.py"",
i should add <code>""import Myapp.py()""</code> to be able to call
<code>""Myapp.activate_callback"" ( ""other.module"" in this case being Myapp )</code>.</p>

<p>So globally i will have ""Myapp.py"" wich contain ""import Mydata"" and ""import Mygui"" and also the Module ""Mygui.py"" wich will contain ""import pygtk"" and ""import Myapp"" . </p>

<p>I feel not very satisfied by the circular relation between ""Myapp.py"" wich import ""MyGui"" 
and ""MyGui"" wich will import ""Myapp""</p>

<p>. </p>

<p>Is this really what i should do to separate the gui procedings from the application processing ?</p>

<p>The event listener prepends a div with the content sent from the server, but there are 2 problems:</p>

activate: -&gt;
    self = @
    source = new EventSource('/api/v1/testposts')

</code></pre>

<p>'savedId' is set in the Posts.new controller after a post is saved. This is hit or miss...</p>

<p><strong>Method 2 Using store.push</strong> - </p>

<pre><code>Auth.NotebookIndexRoute = Ember.Route.extend(

model: -&gt;
    @modelFor('notebook').get('notes')

activate: -&gt;
    self = @
    source = new EventSource('/api/v1/testposts')

            content: data.content
</code></pre>

<p>The push method does not update the template.</p>

<p><strong>Method 3 - Works <em>SOME</em> of the time</strong></p>

<pre><code>Auth.NotebookIndexRoute = Ember.Route.extend(

The position numbers must be sequential from top to bottom starting with 1. The problem is that some of the ad tags are defined in the master/layout page and others are defined within the page markup.</p>

<p>Please see the following example code:</p>

<p>_Layout.cshtml:    </p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Ad Position Test&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
  @Html.SequentialNumber()
  @RenderBody()
  @Html.SequentialNumber()
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Index1.cshtml:</p>

<pre><code>@{Layout = ""~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml"";}

@Html.SequentialNumber()
</code></pre>

<p>Index2.cshtml:</p>

<pre><code>@{Layout = ""~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml"";}

@Html.SequentialNumber()
@Html.SequentialNumber()
</code></pre>

<p>Helpers.cs</p>

<pre><code>public static class HtmlHelperExtensions
{
    public static HtmlString SequentialNumber(this HtmlHelper html)
    {
        var tile = (int)(html.ViewData[""Tile""] ?? 1);
        html.ViewData[""Tile""] = tile + 1;

        return new HtmlString(tile.ToString());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output of this setup for Index1.cshtml is: ""2 1 3"" and for Index2.cshtml it is: ""3 1 2 4"". This is of course the result of the RenderBody method being executed before the master content is executed.</p>

<p>So question is, how do you output a correctly ordered sequence of numbers that spans both the master page and the content page such that the output will be ""1 2 3"" and ""1 2 3 4"" respectively?</p>

<p>Can I make a local html file that submits a form to a website, and have that data accepted?</p>

<p>At work I basically copy info, from an xml source that arrives email by email, into multiple tools. This feels a bit like a job for a robot. I'd like to make a webpage that accepts the xml file and automatically sorts the data into form fields that I can submit via POST directly to the web tools.</p>

<li>Can't be done without a webserver right?</li>
<li>And even then, cross domain posting is usually disallowed?</li>

<p>I don't have access to the databases or apis unfortunately. And we use IE9, so I don't think there's an approach like greasemonkey or a homemade extension that I could leverage to move the data directly into the webform on page.</p>

In the app I was using jythonc to convert the python scripts to java classes and then include these classes in my webapp like any other.
So I was able to assign package name to python scripts and access these classes like any other java class.</p>

<p>Now I plan to migrate to Jython 2.5. Jython 2.5 has removed support for jythonc.
So I tried to use</p>

<pre><code>jython -m compileall /path/to/my/python/scripts. 
</code></pre>

<p>When I do that I get all the compiled bytecode files in the same folder. Each of the files have names like myclass$py.class (where my python file is myclass.py).</p>

<p>My questions -</p>

<ol>
<li>First of all can I access these classes in another normal java
class?</li>
<li>If so, what is the class name I should use ? When I use it like new
myclass() my code does not compile.</li>
<li>Is there a way, I can assign / force a package name or class name
for the generated bytecode with compileall?</li>
</ol>

<p>Note -</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to upgrade to jython 2.5 because I need newer versions of
python that it supports. </li>
<li>I would like to stick with pre-compiling the
python code into bytecode, as I want to do optimizations on the
bytecode. So the <a href=""http://www.jython.org/jythonbook/en/1.0/JythonAndJavaIntegration.html"" rel=""nofollow"">recommended</a> object factory method is only a
last resort. I am assuming the object factory approach will not allow
me to process the generated bytecode.</li>

<p>So let's take that list: </p>

<pre><code>    (list (cons 1 2) (cons 3 4) (cons 5 6))
</code></pre>

<p>Then what I want, is to endup with a string formatted like this:</p>

<pre><code>    ""?1=2&amp;3=4&amp;5=6""
</code></pre>

<p>What I did come up with so far is:</p>

<pre><code>    (defvar *s* 
      (make-array 0 
              :element-type 'character 
              :adjustable t 
              :fill-pointer 0))

    ;; (serialize-params) will return a properly formatted string 
    ;; that will be used elsewhere in another function
    (defun serialize-params (params)
      (loop for (a . b) in params
         do (format *s* ""~a=~a&amp;"" a b))
      (concatenate 'string ""?"" (trim *s*)))

    ;; Utility function to remove the last character of a string
    (defun trim (str)
      (subseq str 0 (- (length str) 1)))
</code></pre>

<p>It kind of work, but I really don't like this for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't want to use a special variable</li>
<li>everytime I run <code>(serialize-params (...))</code>, <code>*s*</code> just append to the previous call</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that to solve my issue, I have to use <code>loop</code> in some special way and probably that I would have to bind a lexical variable within my function. The problem is that I am not sure how I could append each iteration of <code>(format nil ""..."")</code> to that lexical variable...</p>

<p>I have added <code>Cache-Control:Max-Age=604800</code> to the response headers in the request.</p>

<p>I have added the following code my apps AppDelegate.m file:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{

    //set up the URL cache
    NSURLCache *URLCache = [[NSURLCache alloc] initWithMemoryCapacity:4 * 1024 * 1024

    [NSURLCache setSharedURLCache:URLCache];
}
</code></pre>

<p>And my request in the code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *myURLString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""http://domain.com/api/?location=%@,%@&amp;date=%@&amp;method=%@"", latitude, longitude, curDate, methodString];

NSLog(@""%@"", myURLString);

NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:myURLString];

NSData *jsonData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:url];
</code></pre>

<p>I do not think this is working, because when running with instruments network profile I see a spike in network request each time the view is loaded and if I load the app then put the phone in plane mode no data loads (whereas I suspect it would use the cache).</p>

<p>Is this proof that no cache is being made/used? And, if so, does anyone have any ideas why not? And, if it's not proof, does anyone know how I can better test the caching?</p>

<p><strong>Code Setting:</strong> There is an array of integers which is filled with values inside a for loop.<br>
<strong>VS Project Settings:</strong> Two profiles(configuration settings) are used. The first is the default <strong>Release</strong> profile and the second, let's call it <strong>D_Release</strong>, is an exact copy of the Release profile with only one difference; the D_Release profile uses the <strong>Multi-threaded Debug DLL(/MDd)</strong>.</p>

<p>I ran the code for the two profiles and for each profile I stored the array in the heap, stack and bss (so 6 different configurations).</p>

<p>The times I measured are the following:  </p>

<pre><code> ------+---------+-----------
|      |   /MD   |   /MDd    |
|------+---------+-----------|
| Heap |  8,5ms  |   3,5ms   |
|------+---------+-----------|
| Stack|  3,5ms  |   3,5ms   |
|------+---------+-----------|
| bss  |   10ms  |   10ms    |
 ------+---------+----------- 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>[START EDIT]</strong><br>
After some comments, I measured the working set size just before the loop and got the following results</p>

<pre><code> ------+---------+-----------
|      |   /MD   |   /MDd    |
|------+---------+-----------|
| Heap |  2.23mb |  40.6mb   |
|------+---------+-----------|
| Stack|  40.4mb |  40.6mb   |
|------+---------+-----------|
| bss  |  2.17mb |  2.41mb   |
 ------+---------+----------- 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>[END EDIT]</strong></p>

<p>When using the Multi-threaded Debug DLL(/MD)(default Release profile) and storing the array in the heap the code runs much slower and in the bss I get slow performance in either profile.</p>

<p><strong>Actual Question:</strong> I find it strange that the <strong>Debug dll gets runs faster</strong>. Can someone explain the differences in performance?</p>

<p><strong>Extra Info:</strong> I tried manually defining and undefining the _DEBUG flag and making sure that the difference comes from the use of the different dll. I also used different timers (e.g. QueryPerformanceCounter), tried running the executables from the VS and from the command line and tried setting _NO_DEBUG_HEAP=1. I also used aligned malloc(_mm_malloc) to see if anything changed, but it didn't make a difference</p>

I am not exactly sure if it was this way from the beginning or only lately, but when I add new class that inherit from <code>UITableViewController</code> and such, <code>Xcode</code> does not add the <em>pre-generated</em> methods as it usually does. On top of that, when I add a new class and choose <code>Swift</code>, the file imports <code>Cocoa</code> on default instead of <code>UIKit</code>, so I have to change it manually every time.</p>

<p>As it doesn't prevent me from creating <code>classes</code> etc., it is a bit annoying to deal with that every time. I would appreciate some help with that issue, searching for an answer led me nowhere so far. Thanks!</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like to ensure latest binary is submitted in the same change list as the code changes.</p>

<p>My requirements are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The code should be recompiled and binary should be checked out when source code dependencies change.</li>
<li>Related documentation / non-source files do not affect binary</li>
<li>Perforce should complain when sources are changed and submitted but the binary isn't included in the change list.</li>
</ul>

<p>How could I enforce these rules?  Is it possible to create a P4 script that runs before each submission?  Also, is it possible to write a Visual Studio script that automatically checks out the executable before compiling?</p>

<p>I already set up tomcat and it works find but i'm still having some problems here.
The thing is I can normally access a controller's action from my browser without a problem, but when I started adding annotations and ContextLoaderListener it gave me a 404 status all the time. I don't know what I did, but by tweaking some things around, my browser at least tries to reach the controller again. But throws a huge error log which I will share at the end of this post.</p>

Previously, I have just been using a mix of a text editor and the terminal to write and run my models but I am currently experimenting with using Enthought Canopy Editor. I have a model that is works when I run in in the terminal using <code>python model.py</code> but when I try doing<code>%run model.py</code> in Canopy's iPython shell I get:</p>

<p>My guess is that the terminal and Canopy look for modules in different places but I don't know how to rectify it. I found this reference on the Gurobi group site about <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gurobi/ArCkf4a40uU"" rel=""nofollow"">Enthought Canopy and Gurobi on OS X 10.8</a> but didn't know how much those instruction would differ from doing it on Linux and even what he meant about installing Gurobi in Canopy's site-packages.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Based on information found the first link I clicked on, I did in fact leave the boxed clicked making Canopy my default directory. You have to manually prepend the PATH variable, which I missed them saying that I had to do. So I did that. I now have Canopy's version of iPython running in my terminal (check by using sys.path); however, I get a huge list of errors when I try run python.</p>

This question has been asked before, but I couldn't exactly figure out the solution, especially what is the latest solution because it seems that lot of these repositories get updated constantly, probably so are the solutions. I thought of posting this in the previous post with this issue, but noted that I should only provide an answer to teh issue, not post my problem there! So here I am creating a new post.
I know this post will be voted down, blocked, chided.... but please be kind in also pointing to what exactly could be the issue I have.  I have scoured through the web, particularly stackoverflow for ways to install scipy in the linux system I am using, and to the best of my knowledge and abilities (limited, I am not a software pro) have used various suggestions posted here.
So here is what I have: 
1) I am on linux system:</p>

<pre><code>Linux compute-0-25.local 2.6.18-164.el5 #1 SMP Tue Aug 18 15:51:48 EDT 2009 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
</code></pre>

<p>2) Installed virtualenv, created and activated a virtual environment:</p>

<pre><code>curl -O -k https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-1.9.1.tar.gz
tar xvfz virtualenv-1.9.1.tar.gz
cd virtualenv-1.9.1
/usr/local/python/2.6.5/bin/python virtualenv.py myVE
. virtualenv-1.9.1/myVE/bin/activate
</code></pre>

<p>3) Installed numpy:</p>

<pre><code>pip install numpy
</code></pre>

<p>4) Tried installing scipy:</p>

<pre><code>pip install scipy
</code></pre>

<p>Got the following error in the pip.log file:
<a href=""https://gist.github.com/hariiyer16/5910959"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/hariiyer16/5910959</a></p>

<p>Also tried (based on a previous post here):</p>

<p>pip install git+<a href=""http://github.com/scipy/scipy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/scipy/scipy/</a></p>

<p>This did not work however. Also tried easy_install which did not work.  Will post these errors too if it helps.</p>

<p>From going through some of the previous posts, I might have to get the scipy dependencies (libamd2.2.0 libblas3gf libc6 libgcc1 libgfortran3 liblapack3gf libumfpack5.4.0 libstdc++6 build-essential gfortran libatlas-sse2-dev python-all-dev).  Can someone tell me if that's the case?  In that case, I have to check with our admin since I do not have superuser privileges (can only install stuff in my directory).  But before asking teh admin, I want to be sure of what dependencies needs to be installed.
It would be great to get some pointers along with some vote-downs.  Would really appreciate that. Previously, I was able to install numpy, scipy etc on my Mac (snow leopard) with help from folks here, and grateful for that.  But this one has been pretty daunting and have spent far too much time on it.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

But I want this to be handled automatically by grails or by hibernate. It is similar to Sharding where a new table would be created  and data belonging to a month will be inserted in that months table. whenever I give a select query with a date range, the appropriate months are queried and data is retrieved. 
It would differ from the classical Sharding in that there is no limit on the data in each table and separation is based only on the month index.
I saw that there is a  grails Sharding plugin, but it looks like it is used for something different?</p>

<p>Right now I have created this structure of 12 tables manually and for every select I get the date range and get a list of month domains to query on and retrieve individually and then again combine this data.. </p>

<p>I want to know if I am not using something out of the box instead of doing the whole implementation manually</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9780099/asp-net-mvc-4-minification-background-images"">ASP.NET MVC 4 Minification &amp; Background Images</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except that I want to stick with MVC's own bundling if I can. I'm having a brain crash trying to figure out what the correct pattern is for specifying style bundles such that standalone css and image sets such as jQuery UI work.</p>

<p>I have a typical MVC site structure with <code>/Content/css/</code> which contains my base CSS such as <code>styles.css</code>. Within that css folder I also have subfolders such as <code>/jquery-ui</code> which contains its CSS file plus an <code>/images</code> folder. Image paths in the jQuery UI CSS are relative to that folder and I don't want to mess with them.</p>

<p>As I understand it, when I specify a <code>StyleBundle</code> I need to specify a virtual path which does not also match a real content path, because (assuming I'm ignoring routes to Content) IIS would then try to resolve that path as a physical file. So I'm specifying:</p>

<pre><code>bundles.Add(new StyleBundle(""~/Content/styles/jquery-ui"")
       .Include(""~/Content/css/jquery-ui/*.css""));
</code></pre>

<p>rendered using:</p>

<pre><code>@Styles.Render(""~/Content/styles/jquery-ui"")
</code></pre>

<p>I can see the request going out to:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost/MySite/Content/styles/jquery-ui?v=nL_6HPFtzoqrts9nwrtjq0VQFYnhMjY5EopXsK8cxmg1
</code></pre>

<p>This is returning the correct, minified CSS response. 
But then the browser sends a request for a relatively linked image as:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost/MySite/Content/styles/images/ui-bg_highlight-soft_100_eeeeee_1x100.png
</code></pre>

<p>Which is a <code>404</code>.</p>

<p>I understand that the last part of my URL <code>jquery-ui</code> is an extensionless URL, a handler for my bundle, so I can see why the relative request for the image is simply <code>/styles/images/</code>. </p>

<p>So my question is <strong>what is the correct way</strong> of handling this situation? </p>

<p>CheckUrl, takes 3 parameters, $file link of file to download, $url url to request at and $headerz are header values.</p>

<p>Now I uploaded a test file</p>

<p>a.txt</p>

<p>with contents</p>

<p>ABCDABCDABCD</p>

<p>Then upon making a successful request and printing responce on Web browser using ti outputs this</p>

<p>Where ABCDABCDABCD is contents ot TXT file. if it is an audio file it outputs some random characters after downloading it completely.</p>

<p>I need to prompt this data to user to download instead of first saving it on server or in a variable.</p>

<p>is there a way, I can check responce header if returned is a file and if a file then prompt user to download.</p>

<p>any solution by this CURL method?</p>

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;form action=""d.php"" method=""POST""&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>This HTML form sends request to target URL and on success prompts user with file to download but problem is in case of error it takes user to THAT website error or waiting page that I don't want to be visible to user.</p>

<p>Please provide a solution, either using curl or using HTML form post.</p>

<p>First I made a Model for Projects:</p>

<pre><code>class Project extends AppModel {
public $belongsTo = array(
    'Responsibleperson' =&gt; array(
        'className' =&gt; 'User',
        'foreignKey' =&gt; 'responsibleperson_id'
    ),
    'Creator' =&gt; array(
        'className' =&gt; 'User',
        'foreignKey' =&gt; 'creator_id'
    ),
);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Person responsible and the person qho created the project may be different, but they are both users.</p>

<p>This works fine. Really.</p>

<p>Lateron I added in the User Model following:</p>

<pre><code>public $virtualFields = array(
    'fullname' =&gt; 'CONCAT(User.prename, "" "", User.name)'
);
</code></pre>

<p>Now nearly any $this->Project->find() call in the controller fails with</p>

<pre><code>Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'User.vorname' in 'field list'
</code></pre>

<p>When you look at the mysql-query, you see that the Query did not take over the changed Model name and it is still serarching for a User...</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
`Project`.`id`, 
`Project`.`projectname`, 
`Project`.`responsibleperson_id`, 
`Project`.`creator_id`, 
`Responsibleperson`.`id`, 
`Responsibleperson`.`username`, 
`Responsibleperson`.`prename`, 
`Responsibleperson`.`name`, 
(CONCAT(`User`.`prename`, "" "", `User`.`name`)) AS `Responsibleperson__fullname`, 
`Creator`.`id`, 
`Creator`.`username`,  
`Creator`.`prename`, 
`Creator`.`name`, 
(CONCAT(`User`.`prename`, "" "", `User`.`name`)) AS `Creator__fullname` 
FROM 
`database`.`projects` AS `Project` 
LEFT JOIN 
`database`.`users` AS `Responsibleperson` 
ON 
(`Project`.`responsibleperson_id` = `Responsibleperson`.`id`) 
LEFT JOIN 
`swdevel`.`plantbook_users` AS `Creator` 
ON 
(`Project`.`creator_id` = `Creator`.`id`) 
WHERE 
(`Project`.`projektname` LIKE '%Searchsometing%')
</code></pre>

<p>Leaving the ""User"" in the virtual field away and just writing CONCAT(prename, "" "", name), would make it abigous. How do I teach cake to change the Model name for the virtual fields?</p>

<p>Is there any solution except making a view in the database to have a ""second"" Model?</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>

<p>In Ryan's application he has a structure like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Surveys ---> 2. Questions ---> 3. Answers</li>
</ol>

<p>So a user can create a survey and add/delete questions, with corresponding answers that they can add/delete.</p>

<p>I'm trying to do it a little differently. I have:</p>

<ol>
<li>Surveys ---> 2. Questions ---> 3. Answers Or Comment</li>
</ol>

<p>For my application, after a user has created a question, the user can create an answer (just like Ryan's app). But there is a select box next to each answer, with the default being ""Answer"" and the other being ""Comment"". I'm trying to get basically the same functionality of Ryan's app, but with two tables: <strong>comments</strong> table and <strong>answers</strong> table.</p>

<p>My code mimics the railscast, except for my answer_fields partial looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;fieldset&gt;
   &lt;%= f.label :content, ""Answer"" %&gt;
   &lt;%= f.select :switch_answer_table options_for_select([""Answer"", ""Comment""]), class: ""change-type"" %&gt;
   &lt;%= f.text_field :content %&gt;
   &lt;%= f.check_box :_destroy %&gt;
   &lt;%= f.label :_destroy, ""remove"" %&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and I have a comment_fields partial that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;fieldset&gt;
   &lt;%= f.label :content, ""Comment"" %&gt;
   &lt;%= f.select :switch_answer_table options_for_select([""Comment"", ""Answer""]), class: ""change-type"" %&gt;
   &lt;%= f.text_field :comment_content %&gt;
   ... (leaving out some stuff) ...
   &lt;%= f.check_box :_destroy %&gt;
   &lt;%= f.label :_destroy, ""remove"" %&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My question.rb model looks like:</p>

<pre><code>class Question &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :survey
  has_many :answers
  has_many :comments
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :answers, allow_destroy: true
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :comments, allow_destroy: true
end
</code></pre>

<p>I've been working on this, and I'm stuck. My jQuery only looks like this so far:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery -&gt;
   $('form').on 'click', '.remove_fields', (event) -&gt;
     $(this).prev('input[type=hidden]').val('1')
     $(this).closest('fieldset').hide()
     event.preventDefault()

   $('form').on 'click', '.add_fields', (event) -&gt;
     time = new Date().getTime()
     regexp = new RegExp($(this).data('id'), 'g')
     $(this).before($(this).data('fields').replace(regexp, time))
     event.preventDefault()

   $('form').on 'change', '.change-type', (event) -&gt;

<pre><code>public void ConvoManager(final String npcID, final String dialogNode, final String previousNode) {
    final Dialog convoDialog = new Dialog(MainActivity.this);
</code></pre>

<p>Then I populate it with info from the dialogNode passed in, and response options are generated dynamically in TextViews. Click the TextView, and the next dialog happens, etc.</p>

<p>This works great in Android 2.2 (API 8), but in higher versions such as 4.4.2 (API 19), what's happening is every time I click a response option, it's creating whole new instances of the conversation dialog. In other words, if I get three or four responses deep into the conversation, I've created three or four dialogs that all behave independently. On API 8, this doesn't happen. My listener on the response options that step through the conversation are like so (from within the same method):</p>

            rowTextView.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.customborder);

    }
});

<p><code>((A++))</code> seems to return <code>1</code> if and only if <code>A</code> equals <code>0</code>. (Disclaimer: I have not done exhaustive tests. Tested in bash 4.1.2 and 4.2.25). So the final question boils down to:</p>

<p>Why does <code>A=0; ((A++))</code> return <code>1</code>?</p>

<p>Can you tell me how can we ensure strong consistency (R=Q, W=Q)? </p>

<p>For example, let's assume I have a Riak cluster consists of 3 nodes. My Riak Java Driver based client communicates with the ring via HAProxy. What happens if the client wants to write entries w=quorum? How can the client be sure that at least two nodes confirmed the write if it only communicates with the HAProxy? I would assume that my client would think as it only communicated with a 1-node Riak cluster. Therefore it can never be sure how many Riak nodes confirmed the store operation. Is it correct or am I mistaken? </p>

<p>Then the html writes that width of the cells is 100px, but it is still trying to auto fit everything.</p>

<p>What I want it to do is if it is too big, to h-scroll, but I always want each cell to be exactly 100px.</p>

<p>I have this style for scrolling:</p>

<pre><code>#calendar
{
    overflow-x:auto;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But the elements are still showing up as variable widths based on the date.
Here is what it looks like:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/UpspG.png"" alt=""enter code here""></p>

<p>Clearly, each of my columns are not 100px as I have requested, and the resource columns are not 150px as requested. What can I do to get the desired look?</p>

<p>The other problem is there is no class defined for a new week. I would really like to show the columns where week X is written as different colors.</p>

<p>Any insight into either of these would be very helpful.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>2) checking the validity of the file name: I used the 'isempty' and 'strfind' functions, but I know there is an easier option to do this. In my code, I have to check each letter in other case:</p>

<pre><code>    while isempty(strfind(answer,'=')) == 0 || isempty(strfind(answer,'*')) == 0 || ...
</code></pre>

<p>maybe with 'regexp' function, but I don't know how to do this :/</p>

<p>so my code is:</p>

<pre><code>prompt={'Enter the File name:'};
name='Input for file name';
numlines=1;
answer=inputdlg(prompt,name,numlines);

<p>I did a search and somewhere it said to encapsulate the page in Iframe. I wrapped this pushpin page in an Iframe (by implementating another page with IFrame with source to this page ). In Pushpin.js I removed all code and just kept below :</p>

<pre><code>map = new google.maps.Map(document.body.getElementById('map'), {
                zoom: 3,
                center: new google.maps.LatLng(40, -187.3),

<p>But it just shows blank screen in app.</p>

<p>I am not getting any help on this. I would like to know your thoughts around this and if what I am trying to achieve is possible/feasible. Would also love some pointers also.</p>

<li>I have tried renaming the extension to <code>php_curl.new.dll</code> and adjusting <code>php.ini</code> but I get an error message about the new filename. I have also downloaded a fresh new copy of the DLL from <code>windows.php.net</code>, but that made no difference.</li>
<li>I have checked the file permissions for <code>php_curl.dll</code> (Right-click on the file >> Properties >> Security tab) and they are the same as the permissions for extensions that load successfully</li>

<li>I am certain that I am editing the right <code>php.ini</code> since the PHP startup error messages changed when I changed the <code>extension_dir</code> value from <code>ext</code> to <code>C:\php\ext</code> as I explained above.</li>
<li>I have made sure to restart the Apache server between <code>php.ini</code> configuration changes.</li>
<li>If in a PHP script I execute <code>var_dump(file_exists('C:\php\ext\php_curl.dll'));</code>, I get <code>boolean True</code> so PHP can see the file!</li>

There are only a couple types of errors that can happen, so I have variables named to describe the error such as <code>$login_error</code> and <code>$timeout</code>.</p>

<p>At the end of the script, if an error was encountered, an e-mail is sent to my team. In the e-mail, I include a brief error message describing what the error was. The problem I'm getting is that the error messages contain a <code>\n</code> character, but my embedded e-mail doesn't preserve the newlines.</p>

<p>I'll show you what I mean. Here's the function that checks for failures and e-mails me:</p>

<pre><code>checkFailure () {
    if [[ $error_encountered -eq 1 ]]; then

    [[ $timeout -eq 1 ]] &amp;&amp; msg=""Error 1: The device timed out\n""
    [[ $login_error -eq 1 ]] &amp;&amp; msg=""${msg}Error 2: Failed to login to device\n""
    [[ $sky_fall -eq 1 ]] &amp;&amp; msg=""${msg}Error 3: The sky is falling\n""

Content-Type: text/plain

$(printf ""%b"" ""$msg"")

Sent on: $(date)
.
quit
EOF
    } 1&gt;/dev/null

}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, every thing here works as intended except that the newlines in <code>$msg</code> get seemingly stripped from my e-mail. If I wasn't e-mailing this text, then printf will happily interpret the newlines and show me two lines with text.</p>

<p>Let's say that an error 1 and an error 2 happened, I'll get this in my e-mail:</p>

<pre><code>Error 1: The device timed outError 2: Failed to login to device
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Why no new line?</strong></p>

<p>If I change the <code>$msg</code> texts to have two <code>\n\n</code> characters at the end, like so:</p>

<pre><code>[[ $timeout -eq 1 ]] &amp;&amp; msg=""Error 1: The device timed out\n\n""
[[ $login_error -eq 1 ]] &amp;&amp; msg=""${msg}Error 2: Failed to login to device\n\n""
</code></pre>

<p>then I get this in the e-mail:</p>

<pre><code>Error 1: The device timed out

Error 2: Failed to login to device
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Notice the extra new line between them now.</strong></p>

<p>Does anyone know why I either get no newline or two newlines, but never the desired one newline.</p>

<li>I had been experimenting with code changes that affected config/database.yml  </li>

<p>and the problem I have now is a bit different.</p>

<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>

<p>My pagination links are working and i see the url change like this: <a href=""http://example.com/home/searchresults/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/home/searchresults/2</a> (for the second page of pagination) etc.
But all the searchresults are shown. When I edit the limit to 1 I get more links, so that's working properly.</p>

<p>Code is working fine in real controller when I'm logged in, there is Tester user in my test database (in another test I'm testing this this account and it's ok), but I can't convince blameable to use this account in test.</p>

        android:showAsAction=""always|collapseActionView"" /&gt;
&lt;/menu&gt;

<p>Then I inflate it and :</p>

<pre><code>public override bool OnCreateOptionsMenu (IMenu menu)
{
    MenuInflater.Inflate (Resource.Menu.actionMenu, menu);
    _actionBarMenu = menu;
    // Get the SearchView and set the searchable configuration

    var searchView = (AppSearchView)searchMenuItem.ActionView;

    searchView.SetSearchableInfo (searchManager.GetSearchableInfo (ComponentName));
    searchView.SetSearchViewListener (this);   
    return base.OnCreateOptionsMenu (menu);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a custom Search View implementation:</p>

<pre><code>public class AppSearchView : SearchView
{
    private IAppSearchViewListener mListener;

    public AppSearchView (Context ctxt) : base (ctxt)
    {

    }

    public override void OnActionViewCollapsed ()
    {
        if (mListener != null)
            mListener.OnSearchViewCollapsed (this);
        base.OnActionViewCollapsed ();
    }

    public override void OnActionViewExpanded ()
    {
        if (mListener != null)
            mListener.OnSearchViewExpanded (this);
        base.OnActionViewExpanded ();
    }

    public interface IAppSearchViewListener
    {
        void OnSearchViewCollapsed (SearchView sView);

        void OnSearchViewExpanded (SearchView sView);
    }

    public void SetSearchViewListener (IAppSearchViewListener listener)
    {
        mListener = listener;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>searchMenuItem.ActionView</code> is null (Consequently, search view is null). But this same code works in another application I have. Both applications are using <code>Xamarin.Android.Support.v13</code>.
Also, if I use <code>android.widget.SearchView</code>, it works fine and <code>ActionView</code> is not null. 
Could someone please shed some light on the same?</p>

I know it happens when the HTML 5 app is refreshed in browser / webview, but how can I make it happen ""manually"". Reason is that we wrap the Sencha app in a webview, and it is often not recreated, the activity it just in the background, and therefore a full reload of the app is not done and the check for update request is not done. I want to be able somehow to force user to update, but for that I need to know exactly how the Sencha upgrade process internally work</p>

Thanks to Brandon that solved half of the problem by giving me one of the missing pieces. See my own answer to see my solution (i dont want to mix things here).</p>

<p>I have the following (simplified) models:</p>

<pre><code>Order(models.Model):
    status = models.CharField( max_length=25, choices=STATUS_CHOICES, default='PENDING')
    total = models.DecimalField( max_digits=22, decimal_places=2)

    def clean(self):
        if self.estatus == 'PAID' or self.estatus == 'SENT':
            if len(self.payment.all()) &gt; 0:
                raise ValidationError(""The status cannot be SENT or PAID if there is no payment for the order"")

Payment(models.Model):
    amount = models.DecimalField( max_digits=22, decimal_places=2 )
    order  = models.ForeignKey(Order, related_name=""payment"")

    def clean(self):
        if self.amount &lt; self.order.total or self.amount &lt;= 0:
            ValidationError(""The payment cannot be less than the order total"")
</code></pre>

<p>In my admin.py i have:</p>

<pre><code>class paymentInline(admin.StackedInline):
    model   = Payment
    max_num = 1

class OrderAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    model   = Order
    inlines = [ paymentInline, ]
</code></pre>

<p>The validation in the clean method of the Order does not work because there is no payment saved when the validation occurs (obviously it has not been saved to the database).</p>

<p>The validation inside the payment works fine (if editing or adding a new payment).      </p>

<p>I want to validate if the order has a payment if the status is 'PAID' or 'SENT', but as i cannot doit the way is in the clean method.</p>

<p>My question is, how can i access the 'payment.amount' value entered by the user in the inline (payment) of the Order form, to accomplish my validation? (considering im in the clean method of the Order model)</p>

<p>My drupal site: <a href=""http://jameshayekserv.com/drupal"" rel=""nofollow"">jameshayekserv.com/drupal</a></p>

<p>my wordpress site: <a href=""http://jameshayekserv.com/wordpress"" rel=""nofollow"">jameshayekserv.com/wordpress</a></p>

<p>tells me: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your PHP installation appears to be
  missing the MySQL extension which is
  required by WordPress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then tried to install the php5 port and get the same exact error as above, autoconf: required version 2.68 not found, although it is installed.</p>

<p>I also tried the command:</p>

<pre><code>make config
</code></pre>

<p>while in the php5 directory. I did not see any options pertaining to MySQL</p>

<p>At one point I got tired of using ports and downloaded Drupal-7.0 from the Drupal site and then scp the file to my server.</p>

<p>I then renamed my /usr/local/www/drupal6 folder to RENAMED_drupal6
Placed the drupal-7.0 folder in the /www directory.
I then changed the drupal.conf file from:</p>

<pre><code>jameshayekserv# less /usr/local/etc/apache22/Includes/drupal.conf
Alias /drupal ""/usr/local/www/drupal5/""
&lt;Directory ""/usr/local/www/drupal5/""&gt;

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>jameshayekserv# less /usr/local/etc/apache22/Includes/drupal.conf

AllowOverride All
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I then restarted apache:</p>

<pre><code>apachectl graceful

<p>After thinking I was done I tried to visit my drupal site:</p>

<p><a href=""http://jameshayekserv.com/drupal"" rel=""nofollow"">jameshayekserv.com/drupal</a> and was greeted with a blank page. </p>

<p>I can't install from ports after updating, I can't install by placing the folder in the directory and I can't get rid of the ""autoconf: required version 2.68 not found"" error even though I installed the latest port of autoconf.</p>

I'm print out the cart on the home page with this code:</p>

<p>I have a multi step attributes selection. So, the idea is, when the user click on the attribute button in the last step, the product variation should be added to the shopping cart via ajax:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).on('click', '#step-4 input', function() {
$.ajax({
    type: 'POST',

});
});

<p>But for some reason it doesn't work for me at all.
What is work is this '/?add-to-cart=456', but in this case the $cart_item array, which used in the cart.php template:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ( WC()-&gt;cart-&gt;get_cart() as $cart_item_key =&gt; **$cart_item** ) {
        $_product     = apply_filters( 'woocommerce_cart_item_product', $cart_item['data'], **$cart_item**, $cart_item_key );
        $product_id   = apply_filters( 'woocommerce_cart_item_product_id', $cart_item['product_id'], **$cart_item**, $cart_item_key );
</code></pre>

<p>contains the empty string with key ['variation'], but ['variation'] should be a key of an array to use it in the get_item_data() method (cart.php template):</p>

<pre><code>echo WC()-&gt;cart-&gt;get_item_data( $cart_item ).

<p>My current solution is to make a single-pixel Rect using the point I want to check for, then using <code>collidelist</code> to compare that point against the list I want to search for. </p>

<p>It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>tgtrect = pygame.Rect(coords, (1,1)).collidelist(rectlist)
</code></pre>

<p>...wherein <code>coords</code> is the point checked (usually, not always, a mouse location) and <code>rectlist</code> is the list of Rects to be evaluated.
<code>tgtrect</code> receives the index number of a colliding Rect, or -1 if there are none.
I need this index value to resolve the identity of the colliding Rect elsewhere.</p>

<p>I feel like there's a better way to get this information (that is, to check <code>coords</code> against a list, returning an index (or False/None/-1 if there are no hits), without having to make a Rect each time), but I don't know what it is (or if it exists at all).</p>

<p>Basically, what I need is <code>&lt;Rect&gt;.collidelist(rectlist)</code>, but for an (x,y) tuple and not a Rect, or <code>&lt;Rect&gt;.collidepoint(coords)</code>, but for a list of Rects and not a single one. (I could use this second method with an iterator for rectlist, but it would be more difficult to get the index for the colliding Rect.)</p>

<p>I looked around a bit and found this,
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12150957/pygame-action-when-mouse-click-on-rect"">Pygame action when mouse &#39;click&#39; on .rect?</a>, 
which offers a way to check for single Rects, but not a list of many. The significance is that my list of target Rects is dynamic; the number of Rects and their locations changes frequently.</p>

<p>I also read through this,
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18554629/pygame-rect-wont-collide-with-mouse"">Pygame .Rect won&#39;t &quot;collide&quot; with mouse</a>,
which gave a solution that didn't really suit the situation for the same reasons.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>((Auth. note: This is my first question, so please forgive me if it's kind of ugly. Please let me know if it does not supply enough information, or there are things I can do to improve it.))</p>

<p>Sheridan's answer does not work for me. There may be something else on the page that's causing the issue. </p>

<p>I've updated the question to include the entire page code. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> </p>

<p>This post was incorrectly tagged as WPF when in fact the issue is in a Windows Store app. This code works perfectly in WPF, hence the confusion. However it does NOT work in a Windows Store app</p>

For some reasons <code>Metadata.Model</code> is null and I cannot get property name. What I mean is I have expected to get a value specified in <code>[Display]</code> attribute. For instance</p>

    return MvcHtmlString.Create(tags.ToString());
}

<p>I have a stored procedure that I create a temp table later on in it, but I need the number of rows that gets returned in that temp table.</p>

<p>The way that I get the temp table is from a select with a few joins. Is there any way to get the number of rows that is returned in that select statement?</p>

<p>I have something similar to:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Book.Title,
       Book.Year,
       BookGenre.Genre
  FROM Book
  JOIN BookGenre ON Book.BookNum = BookGenre.BookNum
 WHERE Book.Title IS NOT NULL
</code></pre>

<p>and before then, I need to get the count of the rows that will be returned from that query. So, essentially:</p>

<pre><code>COUNT(SELECT Book.Title,
             Book.Year,
             BookGenre.Genre
        FROM Book

<p>I'm also pleased with some tutorial</p>

<p>I ended up using <a href=""https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-less"">grunt-contrib-less</a></p>

<p>copy by hand the file</p>

<p><em>/less/bootstrap.less</em>

<p>in my src folder ie

<p>than in my grunt file</p>

<pre><code>less: {
            bootstrap: {
                options: {
                    strictMath: true,

I calculate the VALUE in the users controller:</p>

<pre><code># Calculate percentage complete
  if @hours_total &lt;= 120
    @hours_total_raw = @hours_total                            
    @hours_total_percentage = (@hours_total).to_f/120.to_f.round(0)
  else @hours_total &gt;= 121
    @hours_total_raw = 120
    @hours_total_percentage = 100
  end
</code></pre>

<p>In the user's status page, I have the Bootstrap progressbar code (as shown by Minddust, above):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""progress""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""progress progress-bar-success"" role=""progressbar"" aria-valuenow = ""VALUE""
  aria-valuemin=""0"" aria-valuemax=""100""&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As an aside, Minddust says to replace aria-valuenow with data-transitionsgoal.  Unfortunately, that ""bricked"" my progressbar (in Chrome on a Mac) to use Minddust's term, so I reverted to aria-valuenow.  </p>

<p>The VALUE is passed TO - not from - the following javascript to render the progressbar:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
  $("".progress .progress-bar-success"").progressbar({
});
</code></pre>

<p>This is the basic functionality show in Minddust's demos.  The progressbar correctly renders as a percentage of 100% whatever number I manually make VALUE.  How do I pass a number to VALUE - which is inside the div brackets &lt; div ... aria-valuenow = ""VALUE""  >.  ""VALUE"" is an instance variable that has not been saved to the database; it is calculated on the fly.</p>

<p>The answers I found on Stackoverflow, e.g., the excellent answer to question # 21182058 (passing a pre-defined value from a checkbox), all recommend using javascript; however, they all deal with situations where one is passing in a value from html and not dynamically changing that value.  </p>

<p>I've tried a variety of approaches, even passing the value as ""data"" attached to the link that re-directs the user to the status page with no luck.  Is what I want to do even feasible?  Is there a gem - or different approach all together - that will accomplish this?  Thank you in advance for your help.</p>

Turns out, that <em>some</em> of my regexes need to be compiled as binary to avoid type errors when matching against the bytes that some other function produce. </p>

<p>So I thought to write something like this</p>

<pre><code>@classmethod
def contains(cls, pattern, value):
    """"""
    :param pattern: A regular expression pattern. If input is plain string, will be compiled on the fly
    :param value: A string that might contain the given pattern (can be multi line string)
    :returns: True if pattern is found in value
    """"""
    compiled_pattern = pattern
    if type(pattern) is str:
        if type(value) is bytes:
            print(""binary pattern"")
            compiled_pattern = re.compile(b'{}'.format(pattern))
        else:
            print(""normal pattern"")
            compiled_pattern = re.compile(pattern)        

    if compiled_pattern.search(value) is None:
        return False
    return True
</code></pre>

<p>Creating the ""normal"" patterns works nicely, but for ""binary"" ones, I get</p>

<pre><code>compiled_pattern = re.compile(b'{}'.format(pattern))
AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'format'
</code></pre>

<p>(this error is for python3; python2 directly throws a syntax error at me)</p>

<p>So, how do I instruct python to compile a regex from a variable, but as binary?</p>

<p>( I know that there are other ways to solve the underlying problem; for example by doing a value = str(value) in that very method )</p>

<p>Anyways, I've followed his instructions, and upon successful authentication, it redirects to home/index. I know AD is working because if I use a bad password, the redirect doesn't happen and it presents an error on the login page, which is supposed to happen. The issue is... Upon redirection to the home page, the auth is lost. I still have the option to log in which is wrong. Other than the inclusion of the AD auth, I'm just using the MVC site template from VS2013. I can provide plenty more code if necessary. Ideas?</p>

The coding guidelines of many projects specify that code should be indented using spaces and not tabs. Fair enough. But is there any way that, when I am working with their code, to still see and use my preferred shift width?</p>

<p>For example, this piece of code is indented using 8 spaces:</p>

<pre><code>function foo() {
        return 'foo';
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way that, when I open this in Vim, it displays (and indents, for edits) as this (shiftwidth of 4):</p>

<pre><code>function foo() {
    // edited to add this comment
    return 'foo';
}
</code></pre>

<p>But, when I save it, it saved like so (8 space indents):</p>

<pre><code>function foo() {
        // edited to add this comment
        return 'foo';
}
</code></pre>

<p>This happens quite naturally when you use tabs for indenting. Just adjust your <code>shiftwidth</code> and voila, you can edit in whatever indent you personally prefer. But, most projects these days seem to require indents using spaces. And it seems impossible to edit a file in my personally preferred shiftwidth, yet still conform to a project's indent guidelines when using spaces.</p>

<p>I've got a Model 'Person' which has_many :addresses. This Person model accepts nested attributes of 'Addresses'.
I am creating Addresses only along with a Person model.</p>

<p>the lookup doesn't find the translation for addresses.street, since it is just address.street in the yml file. </p>

I need to manage a hierarchical model where some of the sub-categories may have multiple parents, something like crossing sets. Similiar problems described here.</p>

<p>To be exact i have some structure of categories in which each item can belong to multiple categories (and also on my way i'll need to provide some mean of category inheritance, if item belongs to TVs then it also belongs to Home_electronics, so the regular tag-cloud won't do here).</p>

<p>tl;dr: need a simple way / approach (maybe complex in realization, but simple in managment, like delete, add and find path) to manage model of categories with M:M relations. </p>

<p>Sadly i'm limited to MySQL only, but if this task can't be solved with SQL only, i'll move on to implementing this functionality in PHP (and thus i'll be glad to hear any out-of-the-box solutions of this problem - libraries or just sources, but thats for the worst case scenario).</p>

<p>Looks like the thing i'm looking for is named Directed Acyclic Graph (which was pretty obvious but i was probably too dumb to think about it :)). </p>

<p>It'll be good to see some implementation of it which has good managability. </p>

<p>And by the way, regular ID, ParentID, Data thing is not an option because MySQL doesn't have recursion and thus can't retrieve data by one query (well it can if you make PHP create a query with 1000 JOINs and pass it to MySQL, but thats retarded).</p>

<p>PS: Using only MySQL is not my decision, it's simply given, i know that any NoSQL DBMS would be more suitable. </p>

Normally that content is paid (for eg. additional levels) and it's available via in-app purchase, so I'm trying to find any way to give them something like normal promo codes. (Promo codes are not working with in-app purchase). Is that possible to set up Test Accounts for testing in app purchase after going live (my apps are already in the App Store), so I could configure them for winners? If not, what would be solution as an alternative for promo codes? Many review sites are asking for promo codes too, so answer would be helpful in other cases. Thanks</p>

These consumers will then run alongside my other webapps under the same Tomcat instance.  As the number of consumers that I use has grown, however, I've realized that this is turning into a bit of a maintenance nightmare.</p>

<p>My solution was to convert these webapps to ""main method"" standalone apps deployed as jars.  In fact, I was able to successfully package them all together in an attempt to reuse as many resources (DAO, dependencies, etc) as possible.</p>

<p>Here's what my main method looks like:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {

    ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(""applicationContext.xml"");

    try {
        FooListener fooListener = (FooListener) context.getBean(""fooListener"");

        fooListener.start();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        logger.error(e.getMessage(), e);
    }

    try {
        BarListener barListener = (BarListener) context.getBean(""barListener"");

        barListener.start();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        logger.error(e.getMessage(), e);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question(s):</p>

<ol>
<li>Do I need to do anything special to shut down my JMS connections in my main method application, or will they shut down just fine as the application terminates?</li>
<li>Does anyone have any personal preferences or otherwise regarding whether to deploy jms consumers using tomcat or as standalone apps?</li>
</ol>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>A bit more information: FooListener and BarListener extend the following abstract class.  They inherit their values from the corresponding beans in the applicationContext.xml file, and they both override the onMessage() method to asynchronously consume messages.</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class TextMessageListener implements MessageListener {

    protected ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;

    protected String queueName;

    protected String selectors;

    public void start() throws JMSException {
        Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();

        Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE);

        MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(session.createQueue(queueName), selectors);

        consumer.setMessageListener(this);

        connection.start();
    }

    public abstract void onMessage(Message message);

It seems regardless of which method I use to register my types with properties, the properties are always null unless they have public setters.

<p>Is this possible with Autofac? Or is there another approach when working with property injection to keep the assignments secure?</p>

I recently updated the coldfusion image hotfix (kb403411) &amp; discovered that suddenly CF started needing use of a new directory for some image manipulation functions [imageresize()] </p>

<p>{coldfusionh_home}/tmpCache &amp; it subdirectories /CFFileServlet/_cf_image/. Initially tmpCache  did not exist &amp; had to be created, it's subdirs were created automatically. However there are 3 problems here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Coldfusion does not appear to be deleting temporary files from the subdirs</li>
<li>An error is thrown on the first attempt to write something to these dirs ONLY after the FIRST restart of coldfusion. Subsequent read/write attempts are fine. [trace posted below]</li>
<li>A directory entry has to be added to the sandbox settings to allow access to this directory [actually this is more of a PIA than an issue - it is correct behavior for sandboxes]</li>
</ol>

<p>so I have several questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I test/ensure that CF is deleting these files when no longer needed</li>
<li>what is the possible cause of the startup error &amp; how to fix?</li>
<li>the sandbox thing is a pain, can CF be told to use /tmp or /var/tmp or something instead</li>
</ol>

<p>I've tried several different owner/permission combinations on the directory structure &amp; Am convinced it is not permissions.</p>

<p>Any thoughts/ideas?</p>

<p>Here is the error trace:</p>

<p>where <code>left</code> is the pointer to the first element of the array and <code>right</code>, the pointer to the last element (excluded). I wrote the following code:</p>

<pre><code>static inline
int* choose_pivot(int *left, int *right) {
  return &amp;left[(right - left)/2];
}

void swap(int *a, int *b)
{
    int c = *a;

    *b = c;

}
void quick_sort(int *left, int *right) {

        return;

    int *pivot = partition(left, right, choose_pivot(left, right));
    quick_sort(left, pivot-1);
    quick_sort(pivot + 1, right);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am running 3 kind of tests: one on a sorted array, one on a reverse sorted one and,
one on reverse sorted one. the first test works well, but the second and this ones fails. Basically meaning the functions doesn't work. I can't find any documentation on what I am supposed to do since all quick sort algorithm uses its length instead of a pointer on the last element and I couldn't adapt the ones I've found to my representation. What is going wrong here?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>My new partition function now looks like this after the comments:</p>

<pre><code>int* partition(int *left, int *right, int *pivot) {
    int *i, *q;
    q = right;
    i = left ;
    int p = *pivot;

    while ( q &gt; pivot )
    {
        while ( p &lt; *i )
            pivot++;
        while ( *q &gt; *i )
            q--;
        if ( q &gt; pivot )
        {
            swap(pivot,q);
        }
    }
    swap(left, q);
    return q ;

I have commented the lines to deactivate the default embedded derby DB in properties file. My <code>sonar.properties</code> have following content: </p>

<p>Also, I have environment variable set for maven as <code>MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx700m -XX:MaxPermSize=420m</code>.<br>
Interesting thing is when I tried to run the sonar execution on other machine the same configurations and same DB, it worked. Only thing different is variable <code>MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx890m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m</code>. I can not set it as 890 and 512 on my machine due to memory crunch. If I do maven fails at startup shouting:</p>

<p>Please, see <em>addSubject</em> method in SubjectManagedBean class.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>What is the programming best practice for injecting UserBean into another? Should I use @Inject, @ManagedProperty, etc..</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing your comments.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p><em>Solved:</em></p>

<p>I've change the @ManagedBean to @Named annotation and added the enterprise context to my scopes instead of standard. </p>

<p>I've used <strong>@Inject</strong> to import my jsf managed bean into another.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>parent<br>

<p>The <code>base</code> module contains all my source files but with dependencies I want to import into my own namespace. This shaded module is described by my <code>base-shaded</code> module which basically only contains a POM which configures a dependency on <code>base</code> and the Maven Shade plugin.</p>

<p>This works fine. The Shade plugin includes all the dependencies and creates a shaded artifact, including a source artifact. However, I am missing a <code>javadoc</code> artifact which is not created by the Shade plugin. Therefore, I attempted to copy the <code>base</code> module's javadoc artifact. However, the <code>release:release</code> goal ignores these artifacts which prevents me to deploying to Maven Central. Still, I managed to include copy these files and include them in install target.</p>

<p>Is there a canonical way of including a non-assembled file in a build? I start to think that I might be the wrong approach.</p>

<p>Here is the plugin configuration of my <code>base-shaded</code> POM. Sorry that it is so much, but in the end, it is Maven XML:</p>

<p>I have an app that i am starting to build that has the ""subscriber/publisher"" situation on it's core. </p>

<p>For those who don't know, the idea behind this schema is that:</p>

<p>1) Someone creates a ""Topic""</p>

<p>2) End points subscribe to a ""Topic""</p>

<p>3) Any message published to a certain ""Topic"" is pushed to the subscribers of this ""Topic""</p>

<p><strong>Considerations:</strong></p>

<p>I am going to use Xamarin.IOS and Xamarin.Android as the framework to build this mobile app (so that it can be crossplatform from the begining).</p>

<p><strong>RabbitMQ:</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.google.com.br/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rabbitmq.com%2F&amp;ei=uc8PU9aYLMbMkQfMloH4DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDosbIEgmvo7ybtwDm3q37XqGfbA&amp;sig2=XTkCTEJv8j9UQgehvic62w&amp;bvm=bv.61965928,d.eW0"" rel=""nofollow"">RabbitMQ</a> service is built on top of the AMQP pattern which solves my entire problem of modeling the ""Topic/Subscriber/Publisher"" problem.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>

<p>Now that i have the problem modeled via the RabbitMQ framework, i basically need those ""Messages"" that are ""pushed"" to each endpoint (mobile device) to actually be a ""Push Notification"" instead of the standard message that will arrive to that device.</p>

<p>How can i model my solution to acomplish that ? </p>

    Vector3 destination = transform.position + delta;
    destination.z = transform.position.z;
    transform.position = Vector3.SmoothDamp(transform.position, destination, ref velocity, dampTime);

//Vector3 destination = new Vector3(player.transform.position.x, player.transform.position.y, transform.position.z);

rightSite.position = new Vector3(rightSite.position.x, 

player.position.y, rightSite.position.z);
}

<pre><code>//move player

<p>I think that my question can apply to all languages where winform can run</p>

The question I have is where should those classes live?</p>

<p>So that there is something concrete to use as an example namespace structure and to limit the question to package structure rather than file structure, lets assume the following namespaces:</p>

<pre><code>app
  domain
    exception
    hibernatemapping
  mvc
    propertyeditor
    tags
  persistence
    hibernate
</code></pre>

<p>Domain classes live in the <code>domain</code> namespace, and related exceptions and hibernate mapping files in <code>exception</code> and <code>hibernatemapping</code> respectively. <code>persistence</code> holds DAO interfaces, with hibernate-based implementations in <code>hibernate</code>. All of the MVC controllers live in <code>mvc</code>, with specialized property editors (this is Spring MVC) in <code>propertyeditor</code> and classes that back custom tags in <code>tags</code>.</p>

<p>My gut says that <code>Comparators</code> should live under the <code>domain</code> namespace, perhaps in <code>domain.comparator</code>, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Where would you put them and why?</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: A number of people have suggested using a general <code>Util</code> package. When going that route, would you separate out the <code>Util</code> classes by UI helpers vs. domain helpers? For example, if the domain needed to sort things for business logic reasons, but the UI needed additional sortings that the domain doesn't care about? Basically, would you tend to have a helper package per-layer?</p>

<p>Testing to see whether the objects <code>OAuth</code> (for <a href=""https://build.phonegap.com/plugins/962"" rel=""nofollow"">oauth.io</a>) or <code>window.plugins.pushNotification</code> (for <a href=""https://build.phonegap.com/plugins/1199"" rel=""nofollow"">PushPlugin</a>) are defined or not, I am always getting that they are undefined. </p>

<p>In the folder I have everything together, like:</p>

<ol>
<li>(Essential  Files)
<ul>
<li>config.xml</li>
<li>icon.png</li>
<li>index.html</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(App-specific files)
<ul>
<li>printR.js</li>
<li>pushNotif.js</li>
<li>tAuth.js</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>(Everything is in one folder, I just separated them in the list.)</p>

<p>So it's pretty simple and straightforward, just as I thought the instructions entailed. However, it's not working, unfortunately. </p>

<p>I tried having the phonegap.js file included, including cordova.js instead, having the file cordova.js, and including the js for the plugins, but I don't think it works that way, so the way I presented is what I think is supposed to be how it's supposed to be set up.</p>

<p>This is the script I'm using to handle and check for the phonegap plugin pushplugin:</p>

    alert(""phonegap pushplugin plugin IS included"");//this worked
    handlePushNotif();
} else {
    alert(""phonegap pushplugin plugin not included"");
}

function handlePushNotif(){
    //https://github.com/phonegap-build/PushPlugin/tree/93067b9303252d5ed7394819bf220db56d99d22c

    var pushNotification;
    pushNotification = window.plugins.pushNotification;

    //register
    //Get your senderID by signing into to your google dashboard. The //senderID is found at Overview-&gt;Dashboard-&gt;Project Number.
    if ( device.platform == 'android' || device.platform == 'Android' )
    {
        pushNotification.register(
            successHandler,
            errorHandler, {
                ""senderID"":""888264849750"",
                ""ecb"":""onNotificationGCM""
            });
    }
    else
    {
        pushNotification.register(
            tokenHandler,
            errorHandler, {
                ""badge"":""true"",
                ""sound"":""true"",
                ""alert"":""true"",
                ""ecb"":""onNotificationAPN""
            });
    }
    // result contains any message sent from the plugin call
    function successHandler (result) {
        alert('result = ' + result);
    }

    // result contains any error description text returned from the plugin call
    function errorHandler (error) {
        alert('error = ' + error);
    }

    //tokenHandler (iOS ony) - called when the device has registeredwith a unique device token.
    function tokenHandler (result) {
        // Your iOS push server needs to know the token before it can push to this device
        // here is where you might want to send it the token for later use.
        alert('device token = ' + result);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I include the <code>PushNotification.js</code> script,  I see that <code>window.plugins.pushNotification</code> is not <code>undefined</code>. However, with phonegap build, I think it may be designed to include it automatically. If I don't include it manually (copying the file <code>PushNotification.js</code> from the git repository to the project files and including it specifically), I get that that object is not defined. However, in the phonegap build dashboard, it shows me that the plugin is indeed included.</p>

<p>My table A and table B has same column names(name,id,age,date,class,...) but different number of rows. Table B is a duplicate table of table A and has fewer rows. What I want to know is how I can retrieve the records if they have the same primary key(id) and any of the other column fields (name, age, date, class,...) are different. However, there is one condition. Although the records have same primary key, if only date is changed, records should not be retrieved.Only when the two tables have same primary key, date is different and any of the column fields is changed, the records should be retrieved.</p>

<p>Since there are around 200k records, and around 100 columns, I would like to use advanced SQL, since my SQL will be too long if I use <code>Select.. from... where</code>, but I don't know which SQL to use.</p>

<p><code>TableA</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class Paperboy{

     private string _mobile;
     private string _phone;

     private IList&lt;string&gt; _additionalPhoneNumbers;

<p>The List is mapped as bag with key and element.</p>

&lt;/class&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I try to select paberboys by their phone number (_phone, _mobile or in _additionalPhoneNumbers). _phone and _mobile are no problem but I am stuck with the additional numbers.</p>

<p>I tried with criteria api and with query over. </p>

<p>Criteria Api does not know the property AdditionalPhoneNumbers</p>

<pre><code>ICriteria criteria = session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Paperboy));
criteria.CreateAlias(""_additionalPhoneNumbers"", ""AdditionalPhoneNumbers"");

Disjunction or = Restrictions.Disjunction();
or.Add(Restrictions.Eq(""_phone"", number));
or.Add(Restrictions.Eq(""_mobile"", number));
or.Add(Restrictions.Eq(""AdditionalPhoneNumbers"", number));

criteria.Add(or);
criteria.SetMaxResults(1);
return criteria.UniqueResult&lt;Paperboy&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Query Over does not know Contains:</p>

<pre><code> return query.Where(p =&gt; p.Mobile == number || p.Phone == number p.AdditionalPhoneNumbers.Contains(number)).Take(1).SingleOrDefault();
</code></pre>

<p>Could someone help me out?</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I was pointed to the elements-keyword. After implementing I get an SQL-Exception.</p>

<pre><code> ICriteria criteria = session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Paperboy));
 criteria.CreateAlias(""_additionalPhoneNumbers"", ""APN"");

 Disjunction or = Restrictions.Disjunction();
 or.Add(Restrictions.Eq(""APN.elements"", number));

 criteria.Add(or);
 criteria.SetMaxResults(1);

<p>Exception like this.</p>

<p><code>System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Der mehrteilige Bezeichner 'apn1_.PhoneNumber' konnte nicht gebunden werden.</code></p>

<p>Problem is the alias for join is not used in the where clause for the property.
apn1_ (where) vs. additiona4_ (join).</p>

<p>When click to go to the post, the template blog_post.html is loaded according to $route.current.templateUrl but the browser shows the same content than blog.html and doesn't show the content of blog_post.html template. Without the html5mode, this works correctly and there aren't problems. Maybe html5mode doesn't work well with the parameters links (/blog_edit/:blogId). Below I explain this better with images.</p>

<p>With html5mode enable:</p>

<p>I'm an idiot -- I figured out the problem. In a gem I had written a while back, I had <code>VERSION='0.0.1'</code>, and for some reason that overrode the version number of bundler.</p>

<p>Won't do that again...</p>

<hr>

<p>Some background information: on an OS X Lion computer I'm using RVM with Macruby on a Rails 3.0.7 project. I set Macruby and my current gemset to be the default. When I try to run bundle install, I get the following message:</p>

<pre><code>Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem ""bundler"":
  In Gemfile:
    bundler (~&gt; 1.0)

  Current Bundler version:
    bundler (0.0.1)

Your version of Bundler is older than the one requested by the Gemfile.
Perhaps you need to update Bundler by running `gem install bundler`.
</code></pre>

<p>When I run <code>gem list bundle</code>, it shows exactly one installation at version 1.0.18. I suspect that somehow the RVM default setting is not applied all the way through the system. But the system ruby does not have any bundler installed, much less this elusive 0.0.1.</p>

<p>Anybody know what might be going on here?</p>

<p>Previously I would use the D flag in the manifest file which would copy empty directories. However due to the way I generate the manifest files (as part of our build process) I can sometimes end up with two D entries with the same destination folder. e.g:</p>

<pre><code>D;${A_LIB}/all/pysys/${PYSYS_VERSION}/lib/python2.7/site-packages;./third_party/python/lib/python2.7/site-packages;COMMON;${UNIX}
D;${A_LIB_BT}/python/${PYTHON_VERSION};./third_party/python;COMMON;${ALL}

<p>This causes InstallAnywhere to fail to build the installer.</p>

<p>To get around this I rewrote the manifest generation code to parse the directories previously pointed to by a D and replace the D entry with F entries for each file in the directory. </p>

<p>Unfortunately this will not include empty directories (which we may / may not need in the installer but in general it's just safer to create them than have some piece of code fail because they're not there).</p>

<p>I've tried the following in the manifest. Reference, Reference3 and Reference4 are empty, Reference2 contains a single directory (which is itself empty). Only Reference2 is present in the install - the other three which are empty directories seem to get excluded.</p>

<pre><code>D,$IA_PROJECT_DIR$/samples/pysys/cor_002/Reference,./samples/pysys/cor_002/Reference

"14615308","1","14615446","","2013-01-30 22:43:24","","6","11774","<p>We have a USB device controlled by FTDI's D2XX drivers.  It's currently controlled from a windows machine via a python interface and as a fun project I tried moving the control to a Raspberry Pi (about 1/10th the cost of a PC, not including the OS cost).  There were many hurdles to clear but after a few weeks I finally found all the answers and got it working.  The answers were spread across several forums so as a thank you to the StackOverflow community I thought I'd consolidate them here.</p>

<p>First, the project required:</p>

<ul>
<li>An operating system: I picked up the latest ""wheezy"" raspbian (hard-float 2012-12-16) from the <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads"">Raspberry Pi webpage</a>.  This included python</li>
<li>The <a href=""http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm"">FTDI D2XX drivers</a> to talk to our FTDI device</li>
<li>A python interface to the D2XX driver.  I used <a href=""http://bleyer.org/pyusb/"">PyUSB</a></li>
<li>Our python script</li>
</ul>

<p>I downloaded the wheezy distribution and using Win32DiskImager wrote to a 4Gb SD card.  The RPi booted with no problems.  I then unpacked the D2XX library (libftd2xx.so) and installed it into /usr/local/lib. </p>

<p>PyUSB (1.6)  currently is tested only against Windows, but they provide the source code.  It's pretty straight forward to compile a copy for RPi.  Basically
modify setup.py to link to the libftd2xx.so library (no need to copy it). Also edit d2xx/_d2xx.c to comment out the routines with no linux implementation
(currently ftobj_Rescan, ftobj_Reload ftobj_GetComPortNumber). Copy WinTypes.h and ftd2xx.h from the FTDI D2XX driver download (in the release) directory into ftdi-win32 and run python setup.py install which will compile and install the python module.</p>

<p>Once all that was done I wrote a simple python script talk to the FTDI chip. Note you need to run via sudo.</p>

<pre><code>import d2xx
jd = d2xx.open(0)
pd = jd.eeRead()
print pd
</code></pre>

<p>The d2xx module could not seem to find the libftd2xx.so file.  So, I tweaked the setup.py script to link to the static copy of the library, libftd2xx.a.  Voila, I had my first clue of the problem: the D2XX library was built using soft-float, and my wheezy distribution was configured to use floating point registers.  That is, the gcc on my system generated code that was binary incompatible with the D2XX libraries and would not allow them to be linked to.  </p>

<p>To fix this I downloaded the <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads"">soft-float debian ""wheezy"" distribution</a> (2012-08-08) and wrote to the 4Gb SD card.  This time the image would not boot.  After looking around I found this <a href=""http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/2140/cant-boot-wheezy"">helpful answer</a>.  In short, there's a problem with the boot image for the soft-float so that for some RPi boards, it won't boot.  The solution is to replace the start.elf file on the soft-float distribution with one that does work e.g. a copy from the hard-float raspbian image.  Fortunately, the SD card has two partitions: a FAT one and an ext3(?) one.  The boot image is on the FAT partition, so it was trivial to pop the hard-float SD card into a Windows box, copy the start.elf file, pop in the soft-float SD card and update it's start.elf with the hard-float one.  After that, the RPi booted no problem.</p>

<p>After installing FTDI's D2XX drivers and building a d2xx python module from PyUSB, I tried the test script again.  Again it failed.  The d2xx module could read the libftd2xx.so library no problem, but for some reason could just not talk to the device.</p>

<p>Datacore Model:<br>
Report has multiple Items<br>
Item has attributes 'text' and 'position'<br>
Item is a superclass for TextItem and TitleItem<br>
They both have more specific attributes (those attributes are saved correctly)  </p>

<p>Models:<br>
We have an Item super for TextItem and TitleItem, and they are generated from the DataCore Model.</p>

<p>ViewControllers:<br>
ItemViewController is a super to TitleItemViewController &amp; TextItemViewController  </p>

<p>Views:<br>
TitleItemView &amp; TextItemView are subclasses to ItemView  </p>

<p>We are using the following code to save our textItem (in the ViewWillDisappear method in TextItemViewController):  </p>

<pre><code>[MagicalRecord saveUsingCurrentThreadContextWithBlock:^(NSManagedObjectContext *localContext) {
TextItem *ti = [self.textItem MR_inContext:localContext];
    NSString *newText = [self getText];
    ti.text = newText;
} completion:^(BOOL success, NSError *error) {
    if (!success) {
        NSLog(@""Could not save"");
    }
}];
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't save. We get the message that the there are no changes, although we logged the objects, and the text attribute DOES change. The weird thing is that the text is saved somewhere (even if the message says it's not). We can use the app and it keeps the correct text. Only when we rerun the application, the text has reset to default values (we create the textItem with some default text, but when it loads, it reads the text out of the loaded Model).    </p>

<p>We think the problem might be in the inheritence, because other values are saved correctly, but the text attribute is an attribute that is used for all of our Item type objects.    </p>

    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string FirstMidName { get; set; }

    public int AttendingDays { get; set; } // Total number of days for attendance
    public virtual ICollection&lt;Enrollment&gt; Enrollments { get; set; }
}

public class Enrollment
{
    public int EnrollmentID { get; set; }
    public int CourseID { get; set; }
    public int StudentID { get; set; }
    public virtual Course Course { get; set; }
    public virtual Student Student { get; set; }
}

public class Attendance
{
    public int AttendanceID { get; set; }
    public int CourseID { get; set; }
    public int StudentID { get; set; }
    public int AttendanceDay { get; set; }
    public bool Present { get; set; }
    public virtual Course Course { get; set; }
    public virtual Student Student { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>How would I go about building a ViewModel that would let me edit the Attendance Table appropriately adjusting the number of days of attendance for the specified class depending on the AttendingDays int from the Course class.</p>

<p>i.e. If Class X has an AttendingDays value of 10, I need 10 rows of attendance dates that I can go down and fill a checkox for present/absent for each student - while Class Y only has 3 AttendingDays, etc. . .</p>

<p>So a sample row from the attendance table would read something like: ID 25: For Course X, Student X on day 3 was present.  ID26: For Course X, Student X on day 4 was absent, etc. . .</p>

<p>What is the most efficient way to approach this?</p>

<p>UPDATE: </p>

<p>Now I create Attendance database entries where the student is marked as Present = false for every possible day of attendance once they are added to a class.</p>

<p>How would my ViewModel work now that I know I will always have the appropriate attendance days already in creation for each student?</p>

<p>I would need to generate a page that displays a row for every Student contained within a Course (this information is contained within the Enrollment table).  Each Student's row would contain checkboxes for each day of attendance (so there would be a grid of checkboxes going across the screen with student names listed on the left and the number representing the day of attendance across the top).</p>

<p>Would this be something jqGrid would be useful? </p>

When I tried proxy url calls or even fetching the data from code behind and wrapping in json I still do not get the data into the grid. So I gave up and went with extjs and nodejs and still using mongodb; this worked perfectly but I still have to learn to create a better UI using express/jade etc which is a different project now. But then I came across using MVC with extjs and with a sample project tried the same thing (the sample had hardcoded data) and I cannot for the life of me get it to display the data.</p>

<pre><code> Ext.require([
'Ext.grid.*',
'Ext.data.*',
'Ext.util.*',
'Ext.state.*'
 ]);

Ext.onReady(function () {
Ext.QuickTips.init();

// setup the state provider, all state information will be saved to a cookie
Ext.state.Manager.setProvider(Ext.create('Ext.state.CookieProvider'));

Ext.define('User', {
    extend: 'Ext.data.Model',
    fields: [
         { name: 'username', type: 'string' }
  ]
});

Ext.define('UserStore', {
    extend: 'Ext.data.Store',
    model: 'User',
    autoload: true,
    proxy: {
        type: 'ajax',
        url: '/dashboard.aspx/getDBData',
        reader: {
            type: 'json',
            root: 'users'
        },
        listeners:
        {
            exception: function (proxy, response, operation) {
                Ext.MessageBox.show(
                {
                    title: 'REMOTE EXCEPTION',
               msg: operation.getError(), icon: Ext.MessageBox.ERROR, buttons: Ext.Msg.OK
                });
            }
        }
    }

});

var myStore = Ext.getStore('UserStore');
</code></pre>

<p>the url I am including here is the codebehind function that I initially tried which accesses the mongodb and returns json result. Not working.
Now from the extjs node.js application I have results coming into localhost:3000/userlist which returns a list from mongodb and displays it as follows:</p>

<pre><code>extends layout

block content
h1.
  User List
 u1
 each user, i in userlist
    li
       a(href=""mailto:#{user.email}"")= user.username
</code></pre>

<p>Now would it be possible to use the same server and call the base url and then change the route.js file to return the mongodb json result or call the mongodb localhost:27017 and get a result. Really confused here</p>

<pre><code>exports.index = function(db) {
 return function(req, res) {
 var collection = db.get('usercollection');
 collection.find({},{}, function(e,docs){
      res.render('userlist', {
           ""userlist"" : docs
      });
 });
</code></pre>

<p>};
 };</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>First thing I realized from asp.net perspective was that I was not calling a webservice just a codebehind method. Any comments will still be appreciated.</p>

However, I'm having difficulty understanding how to structure my SQL within the query. My data consists of four columns and looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/cu9zb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I create this table using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE ct(id SERIAL, zone_id int, group_id int, area double precision);
INSERT INTO ct(zone_id, group_id, area) VALUES(1,2,6798.50754160784);
INSERT INTO ct(zone_id, group_id, area) VALUES(1,3,10197.7613124118);
INSERT INTO ct(zone_id, group_id, area) VALUES(2,1,85708.8676744647);
INSERT INTO ct(zone_id, group_id, area) VALUES(2,2,56006.5971338327);
INSERT INTO ct(zone_id, group_id, area) VALUES(2,3,5584.33145616642);
INSERT INTO ct(zone_id, group_id, area) VALUES(2,5,8611.99732832252);
INSERT INTO ct(zone_id, group_id, area) VALUES(2,6,36103.5509183704);
INSERT INTO ct(zone_id, group_id, area) VALUES(2,8,9801.14541428806);
INSERT INTO ct(zone_id, group_id, area) VALUES(5,1,45796.0020793546);
</code></pre>

<p>And following the <code>postgresql</code> documentation closely, I use the following code in my <code>crosstab</code> query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM crosstab(
  'select zone_id, group_id, area
   from ct
   ')
AS ct(row_name integer, 
      g_1 double precision, 
      g_2 double precision, 
      g_3 double precision, 
      g_4 double precision, 
      g_5 double precision, 
      g_6 double precision, 
      g_7 double precision, 
      g_8 double precision);
</code></pre>

<p>This results in the following table which is not what I want them to be:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZMNk0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>For example, in row two, I want the following values:</p>

<pre><code>85708.8676744647, 56006.5971338327, 5584.33145616642, NULL, 8611.99732832252, 36103.5509183704, NULL, 9801.14541428806
</code></pre>

<p>Instead the values are:</p>

<pre><code>85708.8676744647, 56006.5971338327, 5584.33145616642, 8611.99732832252, 36103.5509183704, 9801.14541428806
</code></pre>

<p>However, it seems that the <code>null</code> values are ignored, so that my column names <code>g1</code> to <code>g8</code>, do not correspond to the original groups.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble wrapping my head around how to deal with routes in association with views. Basically I have a view (let's call it <code>ListView</code>) that, depending on its <code>viewMode</code>, renders <code>ItemViews</code> using different templates. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var ListView = Backbone.View.extend({

    // Cache a bunch of templates here

    viewMode: 'list', // Default is list

    render: function() {

        switch(this.viewMode) {
            case 'list':
                // Render ItemView based on list template
                break;

            case 'gallery':
                // Render ItemView based on gallery template
                break;

        }

        // Render all items in list
        this.collection.each(function(model, index) {
            new ItemView(); // Maybe pass viewMode as a parameter
        });

    }

});
</code></pre>

<p>My goal is that whenever <code>ListView</code> uses the <code>viewMode</code> ""list"" or ""gallery"", this should be reflected in the address bar, and likewise manually entering or clicking a link that leads to e.g. <strong>mysite.com/page.html#items/list</strong> or <strong>#items/gallery</strong> should render the same results.</p>

<p>Is there a way of automating this process, or in some other way solve it?</p>

I've managed to configure this using WebDav (as our previous SVN installation also used WebDav) over HTTPS. Gettings this to work with the clients was a pain, but seems to be working correctly now.</p>

<p>However, during the troubleshooting the issues we had trying to connect to the server to clone and push etc. we read a few comments here and there that suggested that WebDav combined with Git was discouraged (for example, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5264949/cannot-push-git-to-remote-repository-with-http-https"">Cannot push Git to remote repository with http/https</a>). </p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be a very clear argument though, so I'm wondering if it would be worth switching to SSH. The biggest disadvantage of that approach to me would be that we have to create user accounts on the server for each of the users that requires access to the repositorie(s), allowing them to start an SSH session as well (also see <a href=""http://www.jedi.be/blog/2009/05/06/8-ways-to-share-your-git-repository/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jedi.be/blog/2009/05/06/8-ways-to-share-your-git-repository/</a>). With WebDav this seems much more contained to just the repositories, so for me that feels more 'safe'.</p>

<p>Since I'm not a very experienced sysadmin it could be that there are configuration options I'm unaware of that allow me to contain the user priviliges more when using SSH as well, so please educate me if that is the case.</p>

<p>So the bottom line question is, what are the disadvantages of using WebDav to connect to a remote Git repository and is it worth switching to SSH?</p>

Pushing the user name on successful login:</p>

<pre><code>NDC.push(credentials.getUsername());

<p>Which works, but the NDC is managed per thread, so once another thread processes a request from the same logged in user, the trace of this user name is lost.
I was thinking that there should be a common pattern to accomplish this simple task which is attaching each log message to the logged user, using the NDC or not, to know exactly what user triggered what action.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have a <code>&lt;input type=""range""&gt;</code> and I'm trying to set its value by jQuery. That basically doesn't do anything.</p>

<p>Then, I tried hiding/showing as I thought it would be a drawing problem, but to no avail did I so.</p>

<p>Lastly, I hid the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> and showed it using <code>show(1)</code>, which would mean a fading-in of 1ms. This <em>did</em> set the value, however after doing so the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> isn't draggable anymore.</p>

<p>I made this fiddle up: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/MhDf7/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/MhDf7/2/</a>.</p>

<p>Each tr has a class, odd is a white background and even have a gray background. Im using jquery that says if a button in one of the td is clicked then hide the entire tr row where the button was clicked. Some table rows have an additional tr right after it for notes, so the jquery detects if that is present as well, if so remove that tr as well. But the issue now is if I hide a tr that has a gray background the table row below it comes up and now I have 2 table rows that are white and breaks the odd/even design of the table rows. So I tried writing additional code below to do additional check but it stops the script from working. It doesnt give me an error, it just shows the script as aborted, any suggestions?</p>

<pre><code>        $('.button_clicked').click( function(e) {

        var row = $(this).closest('tr');

        // hide this row first
        row.hide();

        // next, get the next TR, see if it is a notes row, and hide it if it is
        var nxt = row.next();

        if (nxt.hasClass('show_notes')) {

            nxt.hide();

        }else

<p>I've been trying to rewrite a simple Ruby implementation of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi"" rel=""nofollow"">'Towers of Hanoi'</a>.</p>

<p>Here is some of my code so far:</p>

<pre><code>function Tower() {
  this.rods = [[8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [], []];
  this.gameOver = false;
}

Tower.prototype.showTowers = function () {
  var i;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
    console.log(i + 1 + ': ' + this.rods[i]);
  }
};

Tower.prototype.moveRod = function (from, to) {
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am struggling with writing the play loop. I think the issue is that I'm not familiar with asynchronous functions. My play loop pseudocode is something like:</p>

<pre><code>until game.win? {
  game.show_towers
  until valid_move?(move) {
    move = request_move
  }
  make_move(move)
}
game.congrats
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried <a href=""https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-prompt"" rel=""nofollow"">prompt</a> and <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/readline.html"" rel=""nofollow"">readline</a>. I'm assuming neither are 'blocking' because in both cases my while loop infinitely cycles through user input requests repeatedly without stopping.</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>This is working great! But only for the first 7 rows... When I attempt to click rows that were once off the screen, getChildAt() returns null. I know that getChildAt(i) gets the view of visible rows only, but once the view becomes visible it returns null. What do I need to do to tell the app the listview item is now visible?

  <p>A user runs a DDL statement such as

I have a lot of data at the start of my program that is generated and thrown into an ArrayList.  Example of what I'm doing below...</p>

<pre><code>m_aUnitsPhysical.add(new UnitData(""P01"", 1, 0, 0, false, false, 300, UnitType.PHYSICAL, 1, ""Unit Name""));
</code></pre>

<p>There's about 236 of these statements in my class constructor.  The array is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>private ArrayList&lt;UnitData&gt; m_aUnitsPhysical;   // Physical array listing
</code></pre>

<p>And in case it helps, the class constructor is...</p>

<pre><code>public UnitData(String p_szID, int p_iAtk, int p_iDef, int p_iUp, boolean p_bLoot, boolean p_bHonor, int p_iCost, UnitType p_Type, int p_iLevel, String p_szName)
</code></pre>

<p>UnitData is a class of mine that simply stores the data, kinda like the old C struct.  I know I'm chewing up huge amounts of memory during this operation.  When it completes however, the Garbage Collector (as shown in logCat) kicks in and free's up huge amounts of data.</p>

<p>So, what's going on?  Is the garbage collector angry with the way I'm doing the above statement, or is it telling me it's killing off memory from other applications?  Is there any way to tell?  Is there a better way of doing what I'm doing above that won't use so much memory?  Should I try and use the SqlLite database instead of doing it this way?  </p>

<p>I rarely get reports from my users that they've run into a memory issue, but they are occurring.  Predominantly its when they leave the app for some reason or another then come back to it; the data in the array dissapears.  I'm just trying to get a handle on how I <em>should</em> be doing this in case I'm doing it wrong.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<pre><code>actors_to_delete = find_by_sql(""SELECT * FROM `dvd_role` a
LEFT JOIN `dvd_actor2role` b ON a.id = b.`roleId`
LEFT JOIN `dvd_actor` c ON b.`actorId` = c.`id`
WHERE role LIKE '%uncredited%'

</code></pre>

<p>I've written it the Railsy way like this:</p>

<pre><code>actors_to_delete = Role.joins(""LEFT JOIN `dvd_actor2role` ON dvd_role.id = dvd_actor2role.`roleId`"").joins(""LEFT JOIN `dvd_actor` ON dvd_actor2role.`actorId` = dvd_actor.`id`"").where(""dvd_role.role LIKE '%uncredited%'"").group(""dvd_actor.id"")
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm wondering (apart from the fact that what is really the difference between these 2 queries, they both do the same thing, so why favour the Railsy way over the more straightforward sql way?) is how do I write it with the relations that are already established in Rails. </p>

<p>If I try do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Actor.actor2role.role.where(""role LIKE ?"", '%uncredited%')
</code></pre>

<p>I'll get undefined method actor2role because, even though the relationships have been established in Rails, they work for an instance of Actor, not the model itself. </p>

<p>So, in conclusion, just wondering what the best way to do it is. Coming from PHP and Mysql I tend to write a lot of these things out the sql way and am trying to change my evil ways :)</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I also have another problem and that's the fact that in the sql query I get all the info from all 3 tables, the Rails way gives me only the dvd_role table for some reason.</p>

<p>How can I get the data from the other 2 table as well?</p>

<p>I was able to do the latter by adding .select(""*"") in the beginning. Is this the appropriate way:</p>

<pre><code>actors_to_delete = Role.select(""*"").joins(""LEFT JOIN `dvd_actor2role` ON dvd_role.id = dvd_actor2role.`roleId`"").joins(""LEFT JOIN `dvd_actor` ON dvd_actor2role.`actorId` = dvd_actor.`id`"").where(""dvd_role.role LIKE '%uncredited%'"").group(""dvd_actor.id"")

But I really don't know how the appropriate error handling is done. Following example should demonstrate my problem:</p>

<p>Batch request:</p>

user2 - invalid (password change maybe?)
user3 - valid access_otken

<p>The answer from Facebook could look like this:</p>

<pre><code>successful answer
unsuccessful answer (OAuth Exception)
successful answer

<p>But reading the docs, it seems like that the ordering of the answer is <strong>not</strong> guaranteed. So my question is, how do I connect the answers with their specific partial requests from the batch request?</p>

<p>Handling the OAuth exception is quite hard when you don't get the information to which request this exception belongs.</p>

<p>I search stackoverflow and google, but nothing helped. I wasnt able to change the ActionBar Background color.</p>

<p>Inside my main Activity I use this code, maybe it is important to the fact that I cant change it.</p>

<pre><code> public void restoreActionBar() {
    ActionBar actionBar = getSupportActionBar();
    actionBar.setNavigationMode(ActionBar.NAVIGATION_MODE_STANDARD);
    actionBar.setDisplayShowTitleEnabled(true);
    actionBar.setTitle(mTitle);
}

<p>I tried not to use AppCompat, but then my name has alot of errors. It extends ActionBarActivity. If I change it to FragmentActivity I cant use ""getSupportActionBar(); and without it my getActionBar(), is always null.</p>

<pre><code>minSdkVersion 19
targetSdkVersion 21
</code></pre>

<p>So right now Iam not able to change it, I tried, renaming the parent of my Style theme.
I tried using andrioud:background and background. The only things that is changing, is when I use another parent like
Theme.App.Compat.Light or Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar</p>

<p>Does someone has an idea, how I could be able to change the colors and other sutff, on runtime?</p>

<li>Echo the 'id' and 'img' from the rows fetched from 3.  </li>

<pre><code>$(document).on('eventA.nameA', '#pageA', function(){

});

$(document).on('eventB.nameB', '#pageB', function(){

<p><strong>Question:</strong>  </p>

<p>Is there a limit (I found about 50 separate doc bindings ) and what's the advantage/disadvantage of setting this on a single selector like so:</p>

<pre><code>$(document)
    .on('eventA.nameA', '#pageA', function(){
        // do sth
    })
    .on('eventB.nameB', '#pageB', function(){

    .on('eventC.nameC', '#pageC', function(){
        // do sth
    });

<p>Most of the bindings are page-specific (it's a Jquery Mobile application, so once a page is pulled into the DOM, its bindings are set like this). So there is really no other place to put these bindings, because will be pulled in and out while <code>$(document)</code> persists.</p>

Next i am using the ForeachLoop containter and looping through for each of the file name and saving it into another string variable called strFileName.  So in my for each loop container, i have script task that checks first if the file exists and here is where i have the problem, for each file name that comes to the variable i want to check if that file name exist firs, if exists i want to load it into my table, if not exist then i want to check the next file name, if next file name does not exist then  i want to check the next variable name inline and so on.  I only want to load if the variable file name matches the files on the network drive, if it is not found then i want to check next one until i go through each one in my static list names.  My issue now script task stops when there is no match with the file names but i want it to go to the next variable name in the list and load it because there are a lot of other matches that are not loaded.  the script task stops at the first one where it finds non much.

<p>The exception does not tell me anything different than ""Not Found"" which really confuses me as I don't know where else to look.The URL failing is: <a href=""http://cbprod-app/InterAction/home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cbprod-app/InterAction/home</a></p>

<p>If I request the page without setting the proxy, comes back with an ""401 Not authorized"" as it requires the proxy authentication to be displayed, I am running out of ideas, any suggestion about what am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

<p>ArgumentOutOfRangeException occurs saying that <code>x</code> (or <code>y</code>) parameter passed to SetPixel method isn't positive &amp;&amp; greater than a given bitmap's <code>Height</code> property.

<p>How do I bind them? Or what am I doing wrong?</p>

I've been driven nuts enough by Perforce I'm now attempting to use a git repo beneath the covers. </p>

<p>My question is this:  </p>

<p>When I'm futzing around with the files via my git repo, is there an easy/automatic way for me to keep track of these in perforce? I've looked into git hooks, and there doesn't seem to be one that when I commit a file to the git repo, it automatically opens the file for edit in perforce, so the perforce server knows about the changes. Let alone anything to do with moving the file around, which git recognizes automatically but perforce needs to be specifically told about.  </p>

<p>I currently have perforce configured so that all files are writable, which makes things a lot easier when using things like emacs for editing. </p>

<p>Should I just be looking into git-p4? I had a few people say they were successfully using a git repo under the covers of another version control repo (perforce or otherwise).</p>

<p>I wanted to use the iOS 7 SDK because our App needs some modifications to work with the iOS 8 SDK.

All the texture information I've found in the SDK describes loading a bitmap from a file and assigning a texture to use that bitmap, but I haven't yet found a way to manipulate a texture as a bitmap pixel by pixel.</p>

<p>What I'd really like is a function such as</p>

<p><code>
void TextureBitmap::SetBitmapPixel(int x, int y, DWORD color);
</code></p>

<p>If I can't set the pixels directly in the texture object, do I need to keep around a DWORD array that is the bitmap and then assign the texture to that every frame?</p>

<p>Finally, while I'm initially assuming that I'll be doing this on the CPU, the per-pixel color calculations could probably also be done on the GPU.  Is the HLSL code that sets the color of a single pixel in a texture, or are pixel shaders only useful for modifying the display pixels?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The thing I got stuck with is the context variable used in the inner returnable function. I can not understand why we should use it here and what context it contains. 
I tried to use the same function with the simple call of debounced function without applying any context to it and it also worked well.
Here is my small fiddle with these two functions:

The background is drawn with using SKShapeNode. In order to save memory, I am drawing only a small part of the CGPath. The problem is that no matter what CGPath coordinates I use, the resulting frame of SKShapeNode will always contain the (0, 0) point. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>SKShapeNode *shapeNodePos = [SKShapeNode node];
CGMutablePathRef pathPos = CGPathCreateMutable();
CGPathAddRect(pathPos, NULL, CGRectMake(50, 50, 50, 50));
shapeNodePos.path = pathPos;
CGPathRelease(pathPos);
NSLog(@""Frame pos = (%f, %f, %f, %f)"", shapeNodePos.frame.origin.x, shapeNodePos.frame.origin.y, shapeNodePos.frame.size.width, shapeNodePos.frame.size.height);
</code></pre>

<p>The result is:</p>

<pre><code>Frame pos = (0.000000, 0.000000, 100.000000, 100.000000)
</code></pre>

<p>However, I would expect the SKShapeNode.frame to be limited only to CGPath contents:</p>

<pre><code>Frame pos = (50.000000, 50.000000, 50.000000, 50.000000)
</code></pre>

<p>Is it a bug in SpriteKit or actually an expected behaviour? If that small CGPath rectangle is drawn considerably far from the (0, 0) point can it also negatively impact the performance or will Sprite Kit ignore empty area of the frame?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Now I want to read and write settings on the robot via the ground station. Therefore I thought about implementing a ""virtual register"" on the robot that can be manipulated by the ground station.</p>

<p>It could be made up of structs and look like this:</p>

<pre><code>// accelerometer register
struct accel_reg {
  // accelerations
  int32_t accelX;
  int32_t accelY;
  int32_t accelZ;
};

// infrared distance sensor register 
struct ir_reg {
  uint16_t  dist; // distance
};

// robot's register table
struct {
  uint8_t     status;         // current state
  uint32_t    faultFlags;     // some fault flags
  accel_reg   accelerometer;  // accelerometer register
  ir_reg      ir_sensors[4];  // 4 IR sensors connected
} robot;

// usage example:

robot.accelerometer.accelX = -981;
robot.ir_sensors[1].dist = 1024;
</code></pre>

<p>On the robot the registers will be constantly filled with new values and configuration settings are set by the ground station and applied by the robot.</p>

<p>The ground station and the robot will be written in C++ so they both can use the same struct datatype.</p>

<p><strong>The question</strong> I have now is how to encapsulate the read/write operations in a protocol without writing tons of meta data? </p>

<p>Let's say I want to read the register <code>robot.ir_sensors[2].dist</code>. How would I address this register in my protocol?</p>

<p>I already thought about transmitting a relative offset in bytes (i.e the relative position in memory inside the struct) but I think memory alignment and padding may cause problems, especially because the ground station runs on a x86_64 architecture and the robot runs on a 32-bit ARM processor.</p>

<p>Thanks for any hints! :)</p>

<p>I have no idea where to start (i have the java in Eclipse) 
and the item on a (localhost) website which has multiple items u can choose from (shown by jquery)
I was thinking of using a database to keep track of what the user selected etc.. But it needs to be able to run for multiple users at the same time.</p>

<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction where to look for? Or a good ReadMe.</p>

<p>I tried using a record reader provided in hadoop streaming but can't figure out how to use it. Could anyone help me make the following code create a nice RDD with page records?</p>

<pre><code>import org.apache.hadoop.io.Text

  def main(args: Array[String]) {

    // configuration
    val sparkConf = new SparkConf()
      .setMaster(""local[4]"")
      .setAppName(""WikiDumpTest"")

    val jobConf = new JobConf()
    jobConf.set(""input"", ""enwikisource-20140906-pages-articles-multistream.xml"")
    jobConf.set(""stream.recordreader.class"", ""org.apache.hadoop.streaming.StreamXmlRecordReader"")
    jobConf.set(""stream.recordreader.begin"", ""&lt;page&gt;"")
    jobConf.set(""stream.recordreader.end"", ""&lt;/page&gt;"")

    val sparkContext = new SparkContext(sparkConf)

    // read data
    val wikiData = sparkContext.hadoopRDD(
        jobConf, 
        classOf[StreamXmlRecordReader],
        classOf[Text], 
        classOf[Text])

    // count rows
    println(wikiData.count)
  }
}

<p>It seems Spark refuses to use StreamXmlRecordReader. I get the following error:</p>

<p>First a question about transactions in .net and SQL Server. If I have something like this</p>

}

    throw;
}

<p>At which point should I call the database to ask for the code of the newly inserted question. Now my second question, before I ask I found this link <a href=""http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/a-sql-server-dba-myth-a-day-2630-nested-transactions-are-real/"" rel=""nofollow"">Nested Transaction</a> . In the light of the above link I want to still ask that if I have something like this</p>

    transactionOption.IsolationLevel = IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted;
    transactionOption.Timeout = TransactionManager.MaximumTimeout;

    using (var outerscope = new TransactionScope(TransactionScopeOption.RequiresNew, transactionOption)) {
        try {
            var transactionOption = new TransactionOptions();
            transactionOption.IsolationLevel = IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted;
            transactionOption.Timeout = TransactionManager.MaximumTimeout;

            using (var innerscope = new TransactionScope(TransactionScopeOption.RequiresNew, transactionOption)) {

                Helpers.CreateQuestionBankItem(ref mappedOldNewQuestionItemGuid, missingQuestionBankItems);

}
catch (Exception ex) {

</code></pre>

<p>If my innerscope completes, will querying SQL Server give me the code of the newly created question. </p>

<p>What happens if the inner scope throws an exception and I gobble it up, will the outer scope also be disposed off?</p>

<p>Does calling innerscope.Complete() completes that inner scope?</p>

The electricity bills are killing me and I thought: if I'm moving the applications to the cloud, why not my datacenter. So I created a Cloud Service, a VPN, and a corporate Domain Controller (along with the DNS setup). I downloaded the VPN installer for a 64 bit machine and, presto, my client machine here in the office is connected to a full-featured corporate network running in the cloud.</p>

<p>So now comes the tricky part.  I want my users and computers in the office to be part of the corporate domain.  However, simply turning on the VPN connection and joining the domain doesn't work.  The user profiles for the domain user in both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 are corrupted and basically unusable.  I suspect it has something to do with the fact that the VPN isn't available when the machine reboots into the new domain.</p>

<p>What am I missing?  Has anyone else tried moving their data center to the cloud?</p>

<p>I'm programming in C#. I have 2 questions:</p>

<p>1 - How to fix the arrows in C#?</p>

<p>2 - How to make the ellipses disapear in C#?</p>

<p>*I know I can use node [shape = none], but I don't know how to set it in C#.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> </p>

<p>Now I've got the following code:</p>

<pre><code>digraph g {
graph [rankdir=""LR"" ,compound=""true"" ];
    subgraph cluster0 {
        graph [label=""Ready\n\nPurchaser:\noperation1,operation2,Supplier:\noperation1,operation3,"" ];

    };
    subgraph cluster2 {

    3 -&gt; 5 [ ltail=""cluster2"" ,lhead=""cluster4"" ,comment=""9""  ];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which gives me:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/P2rYg.png"" alt=""Graphviz4net""></p>

<p>Don't worry about the label problems, I'll fix that.</p>

<p>The C# code is as it follows:</p>

<pre><code>Graph&lt;State&gt; Graph = new Graph&lt;State&gt; { Rankdir = RankDirection.LeftToRight };
</code></pre>

<p>A stringBuilder generates the subgraphs</p>

<pre><code>// returns new SubGraph&lt;State&gt;{ Label = stringBuilder.ToString()};
var stringNewBlock = ConvertBlockToSubgraph(state); 
</code></pre>

<p>Inside ConvertBlockToSubgraph</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var allowedOperation in allowedOperationList)
            {
                stringBuilder.Append(allowedOperation.Key +"":\\n"");

                foreach (var operation in allowedOperation.Value)
                {
                    stringBuilder.Append(!operation.Equals(lastAllowedOperation) ? operation + "","": operation);
                }
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Back to outside world:</p>

<pre><code>var subgraphNewBlock = new SubGraph&lt;State&gt;{ Label = stringBuilder.ToString()};


stringNewBlock.AddVertex(state);
Graph.AddSubGraph(stringNewBlock);
</code></pre>

<p>Then I generate the Edges with:</p>

<pre><code>public override IBlockHandling&lt;State&gt; GenerateLinks()
{
    foreach (var state in statesDictionary.Values)
    {
        foreach (var nextPossibleState in state.GetNextPossibleStateList())
        {
            if (statesDictionary.ContainsKey(nextPossibleState))
            {
                var sourceSubGraph = Graph.SubGraphs.Single(x =&gt; x.Label.Contains(state.GetMainHeaderName()));
                var destinationSubGraph = Graph.SubGraphs.Single(x =&gt; x.Label.Contains(nextPossibleState));
                var edge = new Edge&lt;SubGraph&lt;State&gt;&gt;(sourceSubGraph, destinationSubGraph);
                Graph.AddEdge(edge);
            }

        }
    }

    return this;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I convert to the DOT Format with:</p>

<pre><code>    public override IBlockHandling&lt;State&gt; ConvertDtoToDot()
    {
        var writer = new StringWriter();
        new GraphToDotConverter().Convert(writer, Graph, new AttributesProvider());
        var result = writer.GetStringBuilder().ToString().Trim();

        Console.WriteLine(result);

        return this;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I have simplified it very considerably but this is the basic idea of it. I have a form with a sortable list embedded in it.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""itemlist""&gt;
    &lt;ul id=""itemsort""&gt;
       &lt;li id=""Item_1""&gt;Item&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""itemid[]"" value=""itemsRowID01""/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;li id=""Item_2""&gt;Item&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""itemid[]"" value=""itemsRowID02""/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;li id=""Item_3""&gt;Item&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""itemid[]"" value=""itemsRowID03""/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;li id=""Item_4""&gt;Item&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""itemid[]"" value=""itemsRowID04""/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have JQuery and JQuery UI Loaded and the The Following code enables the sortable list function and posts the item ids and New sort order to a php script. the ""editor"" variable is a public variable that is set on load it works fine. The sorting works fine but the neworder value that posts doesn't seem to change when I re-order the list.</p>

<pre><code>//sorting feature  
    $(""#itemsort"").live('hover', function() {
        $(""#itemsort"").sortable({ 
            opacity:.5,
            update : function () {          

                var neworder =  $('#itemsort').sortable('serialize');
                var inputs = serializePost('#itemlist');

                $.post(""core/actions.php"",{
                   'order': editor,
                   'inputs': inputs,
                   'neworder': neworder},function(){

                       alert(""Order saved."", 1);

                });
            } 
        });
    });
</code></pre>

<p>On actions.php...</p>

<pre><code>    if(isset($_POST['order'])){

            //set a variable for each post
            $batchid = $_POST['inputs']['itemid'];

            parse_str($_POST['neworder'], $neworder);

            //count the number of entries to be ordered
            $count = count($batchid);        

            //use the count to create an incremental loop for each item to be updated.
            $i=0;
            while ($i &lt;= $count) {

   $query =""UPDATE {$_POST['order']} SET order=$neworder[item][$i] WHERE id=$batchid[$i]"";
                ++$i;
            }
        }

As a simple example, take <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/utilities/cmp.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>cmp</code></a>.</p>

<p>Now I would like to have an extra argument <code>--help</code> which shows a description of all arguments, which is important in this case. I have:</p>

<pre><code>po::options_description options(""Options"");
options.add_options()(""help"", ""Show this help output."")
                     ("",l"", ""(Lowercase ell.) Write the byte number (decimal) and the differing bytes (octal) for each difference."")
                     ("",s"", ""Write nothing for differing files; return exit status only."")

po::positional_options_description operands;
operands.add(""file1"", 1);//, ""A pathname of the first file to be compared. If file1 is '-', the standard input shall be used."")
operands.add(""file2"", 1);//, ""A pathname of the second file to be compared. If file2 is '-', the standard input shall be used."");

po::variables_map vm;
po::store(po::command_line_parser(argc, argv).options(options).positional(operands).run(), vm);
po::notify(vm);

if(vm.count(""help""))
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; ""cmp: compare two files\nUsage: cmp [ -l | -s ] file1 file2\n"" &lt;&lt; options;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>which is unable to show the <code>file1</code> and <code>file2</code> options' description. I can of course add them to <code>options</code>, but this would add at least two unwanted arguments <code>[-]-file{1,2}</code>, which I really do not want. I just want this output for <code>--help</code> (without obviously hardcoding it):</p>

<pre><code>cmp: compare two files
Usage: cmp [ -l | -s ] file1 file2
Options:
  --help                Show this help output.
  -l                    (Lowercase ell.) Write the byte number (decimal) and the differing bytes (octal) for each difference.
  -s                    Write nothing for differing files; return exit status only.
Operands:
  file1                 A pathname of the first file to be compared. If file1 is '-', the standard input shall be used.
  file2                 A pathname of the second file to be compared. If file2 is '-', the standard input shall be used.
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way to achieve this without hacking around the library? I'd think this is pretty basic stuff, but I can't find it in any of the <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/doc/html/program_options/tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorials</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> For everyone's benefit, I submitted a <a href=""https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/8430"" rel=""nofollow"">feature request</a> for this, in a hopefully backwards compatible way.</p>

<p>What would also be interesting to know is how I have a bad image format from this. I've checked to make sure that my release is debug in the IDE, as well.</p>

<p>My main question is to know exactly what I am doing wrong, if possible.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I tried moving <code>glew32.dll</code> to <code>SysWOW64</code>, and unfortunately that did not work. I also tried the suggestion which involved moving my <code>draw_window</code> function to the top of main, and that did not work either.</p>

<p>I would like to now configure my cart to send a discount to the gateway.  My first thought was to modify the 'AMT' value that is sent to the gateway.  However, it seems that Paypal validates the 'AMT' field by calculating the total of the <code>ITEMAMT</code>, <code>TAXAMT</code> and <code>SHIPPINGAMT</code> fields to ensure the total is unchanged:</p>

<pre><code>[L_AMT0] =&gt; 49.99
[L_NUMBER0] =&gt; 3706{3}8
[L_QTY0] =&gt; 1
[L_TAXAMT0] =&gt; 0.00
[ITEMAMT] =&gt; 49.99
[TAXAMT] =&gt; 0
[SHIPPINGAMT] =&gt; 14.95
[AMT] =&gt; 64.94
</code></pre>

<p>How many I send a discount to Paypal?  I have looked through what documentation I can find, with no luck; the similar questions here on SO were no help, either.  Thanks.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>: I've noticed I can pass through the field <code>SHIPDISCAMT</code>.  I don't know if this will let me do what I need it to though - I am still getting errors that indicate soemthing is 'mismatched'.</p>

<p>I have a site that must be able to function and set cookies while running inside a frame. In IE, with default security settings, this is a problem, because a framed site's cookies are treated as third party. Now, I've read all the info on P3P, and I've created a compact privacy policy, served via HTTP header, an XML policy file, and an XML reference file. I have checked, and the header is being sent properly, and IE can read the policy file.</p>

<p>However, it is STILL blocking cookies from the site. I've created a stripped-down example here: <a href=""http://www.hankshelper.com/privtest.php"">http://www.hankshelper.com/privtest.php</a>
Note that cookies in the framed site are being blocked by IE (6, 7, and 8).</p>

<p>If anyone could check out my compact policy</p>

<pre><code>Header set P3P ""policyref=\""/w3c/p3p.xml\"", CP=\""IDC DSP COR NID DEVi OUR BUS INT\""""

<p>and/or XML policy
<a href=""http://www.searchtempest.com/w3c/searchtempest.xml"">http://www.searchtempest.com/w3c/searchtempest.xml</a></p>

<p>and let me know wtf, I would be eternally grateful. I've stripped them down as much as possible, and I just can't see anything that IE would have a problem with. (And of course IE itself is wonderfully verbose as far as exactly WHY it's blocking cookies...) I'm happy to provide any additional information you need.</p>

I would like to hide specific implementations of the interface from my program as I will only ever have one ""active"" accounting system.  So I planned on making the methods of the interface unexported (hidden), and then having exported functions native to the base package that call a the same function from a local adapter.</p>

<pre><code>package accounting

import ""errors""

type IAdapter interface {
    getInvoice() error
}

var adapter IAdapter

func SetAdapter(a IAdapter) {
    adapter = a
}

func GetInvoice() error {
    if (adapter == nil) {
        return errors.New(""No adapter set!"")
    }
    return adapter.getInvoice()
}


__________________________________________________

package accountingsystem

type Adapter struct {}

func (a Adapter) getInvoice() error {return nil}


__________________________________________________


package main

import (
    ""accounting""
    ""accountingsystem""
)

function main() {
    adapter := accountingsystem.Adapter{}
    accounting.SetAdapter(adapter)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is that the compiler complains, due to not being able to see the implementation of <code>getInvoice()</code> by <code>accountingsystem.Adapter</code>:</p>

<pre><code>./main.go:2: cannot use adapter (type accountingsystem.Adapter) as type accounting.IAdapter in argument to accounting.SetAdapter:
accountingsystem.Adapter does not implement accounting.IAdapter (missing accounting.getInvoice method)
    have accountingsystem.getInvoice() error
    want accounting.getInvoice() error
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way of being able to implement an interface with unexported methods in another package?  Or am I thinking about this problem in a non-idiomatic way?</p>

<p>After looking into suggestions from @AriBFriedman and @PaulHiemstra and subsequently figuring out how to merge .shp files, I have managed to produce the following map using the following code and data (For .shp data, cf. links above)</p>

<p>code:</p>

<pre><code># Merging Mor and Sah .shp files into one .shp file

MoroccoData &lt;- rbind(Mor@data,Sah@data) # First, 'stack' the attribute list rows using rbind() 
MoroccoPolys &lt;- c(Mor@polygons,Sah@polygons) # Next, combine the two polygon lists into a single list using c()

summary(MoroccoData)
summary(MoroccoPolys)

offset &lt;- length(MoroccoPolys) # Next, generate a new polygon ID for the new SpatialPolygonDataFrame object

browser()
for (i in 1: offset)
{
sNew =  as.character(i)
MoroccoPolys[[i]]@ID = sNew
}

ID &lt;- c(as.character(1:length(MoroccoPolys))) # Create an identical ID field and append it to the merged Data component
MoroccoDataWithID &lt;- cbind(ID,MoroccoData)

MoroccoPolysSP &lt;- SpatialPolygons(MoroccoPolys,proj4string=CRS(proj4string(Sah))) #  Promote the merged list to a SpatialPolygons data object

Morocco &lt;- SpatialPolygonsDataFrame(MoroccoPolysSP,data = MoroccoDataWithID,match.ID = FALSE) #  Combine the merged Data and Polygon components into a new SpatialPolygonsDataFrame.

Morocco@data$id &lt;- rownames(Morocco@data)
Morocco.fort &lt;- fortify(Morocco, region='id') 
Morocco.fort &lt;- Morocco.fort[order(Morocco.fort$order), ] 

MoroccoMap &lt;- ggplot(data=Morocco.fort, aes(long, lat, group=group)) + 
geom_polygon(colour='black',fill='white') + 
theme_bw()
</code></pre>

<p>Results:</p>

<p>New Question:</p>

<p>1- How to eliminate the boundaries data that cuts though the map in half?</p>

<p>2- How to combine different regions within a .shp file?</p>

<p>Added successfully the mobile web environment, as with all the other environments i get on loading a message box stating that the application is trying to access to Worklight server for looking for available updates(if i don't set <code>connect on startup</code> to true i don't get it). the preview url is <code>http://172.17.196.140:9080/worklight/apps/services/preview/jqueryExtendedApplication/mobilewebapp/1.0/default/jqueryExtendedApplication.html</code>  </p>

<p>if it can be useful: my app's layout doesn't fit properly to any screen, both in production and develoment environment:

<p>i created an empty windows8 app , added jquerymobile 1.3.2 and deployed, the development server can't load it, the production server succeeds on loading but gets stuck showing a rotating gear:

<p>Update: without adding JQM the empty app works. I think this could be the issue for the other applications. isn't JQM v1.3.2 supported by windows 8 environment? sounds weird..</p>

dynamic valitating my models.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5640964/advice-on-dynamic-model-validation"">Advice on &quot;Dynamic&quot; Model validation</a></p>

<p>The solution that I got working is:</p>

<pre><code>def after_initialize        
  singleton = class &lt;&lt; self; self; end

  validations = eval(calendar.cofig)

  validations.each do |val|
    singleton.class_eval(val)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>On my actual app, I have 2 models</p>

<pre><code>class Calendar &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :events
end

class Event &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :calendar

  def after_initialize        
    singleton = class &lt;&lt; self; self; end

    validations = eval(calendar.cofig)

    validations.each do |val|
       singleton.class_eval(val)
    end
 end

end
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the validation code that should be added to the Event class lies on the Calendar field ""config"".</p>

<p>Works fine for a existing Event, but doesn't for a new record. That's because, at the time that after_initialize is called, the association doesn't exists yet.</p>

<p>I can't find a way to do that besides putting the config values on Event itself.</p>

<p>Any advices?</p>

My personal preference is to <em>not</em> have any sort of logic in Java enums (although Java provides the ability to do that). The discussion in this cased centered around having a convenience method inside the enum that returned a map:</p>

<pre><code>public enum PackageType {
  Letter(""01"", ""Letter""),
  ..
  ..
  Tube(""02"", ""Packaging Tube"");

  private String packageCode;
  private String packageDescription;

  ..
  ..

  public static Map&lt;String, String&gt; toMap() {
     Map&lt;String, String&gt; map = new LinkedHashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();
     for(PackageType packageType : PackageType.values()) {
         map.put(packageType.getPackageCode(), packageType.getPackageDescription());
     }
     return map;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My personal preference is to pull this out into a service. The argument for having the method inside the enum centered around convenience. The idea was that you don't have to go to a service to get it, but can query the enum directly.</p>

<p>My argument centered around separation of concern and abstracting any kind of logic out to a service. I didn't think ""convenience"" was a strong argument to put this method inside an enum.</p>

<p>From a best-practices perspective, which one is better? Or does it simply come down to a matter of personal preference and code style?</p>

<pre><code>// Main function

In order not to paste the bulk of the script here, I have created a temporary function that will wrap the contents of the <code>div</code>, transforming the ""test"" plain text back into a link. And this is where it goes haywire -- the <code>.click()</code> listener of the first function will not trigger on this dynamically created link anymore and FireBug isn't throwing any errors nor warnings.</p>

<p>The admin page, instead of displaying the data (query returns 1 row), needs to return the table name and column name</p>

<p>Ex: Insteads of:</p>

<pre>
Name      Initial
==================
Bob       A
</pre>

<p>I want:</p>

<pre>
Name                 Initial
============================
Users.FirstName      Users.MiddleInitial
</pre>

<p>I realize I can do this in code but would rather just modify the query to return the data I want so I can leave the report generation code mostly alone.</p>

<p>I dont want to do it in a store proc</p>

<p>So when I spit out the data in the report using something like:
blah blah=MyDataRow(""FirstName"")
I can leave that as is but instead of it displaying ""BOB"" it would display ""Users.FirstName""</p>

<p>And I want to do the query using select * if possible instead of listing all the columns</p>

<p>So for each of the columns I am querying in the * , I want to get (instead of the column value) the tablename.ColumnName or tablename|columnName</p>

<p>hope you are following- I am confusing myself...</p>

<pre><code>select tablename + '.' + Columnname as WhateverTheColumnNameIs 
from Table1 
  left join Table2 on whatever...
  Join Table_Names on blah blah

</code></pre>

<p>You can see here used form_prep($this->input->post('username')) which is helpful for security issue. But when i use the same form to re-populate with ajax on failed validation it does not display the errors nor the input boxes filled. Instead loads the form as if this is the first time this is loaded.
Here is how i using it with ajax.</p>

<p>First in a div i am loading form</p>

<pre><code>$('#userform').load('&lt;?php $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('user_form')?&gt;');
</code></pre>

<p>Now ajax</p>

<pre><code>$(function()
{
    $('#login').submit(function()
    {
        $.ajax(
        {
            type : 'POST',
            data : $(this).serialize(),
            url  : $(this).attr('action'),
            success : function(data)
            {
                if(data == 1)
                {
                    // do something 
                }
                else
                {
                    $('#userform').load('&lt;?php $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('user_form')?&gt;');
                }
            }
        });
        return false;
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>And finally my controller</p>

<pre><code>function insertUser()
{
    if($this-&gt;form_validation-&gt;run() == FALSE)
    {
        echo 0;
    }else{
        echo 1;
    }
}

- I am in IE so window.scrollbars/this.scrollbars won't return anything<br>
- The windows scrollbars exist outside the body.<br>
- Looking at the document's width will tell me about the document. I can even figure out if there are scrollbars in the document. This will not tell me anything about the window itself.<br>

<p>I use <code>SortedMap</code> to get the lowest computed value depending on the parameters <code>Alpha</code>, <code>Beta</code> and <code>Gamma</code>. (I know this is not the case here because it is a very simplified excerpt.)</p>

<p>I would like to get <strong>all</strong> possible values (variable <code>value</code>) stored depending on <code>Alpha</code>, <code>Beta</code> and <code>Gamma</code> in <code>minFromMap</code> and to get the parameters for which <code>value</code> is the lowest value. However, the output of the posted code is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Value: 2.990180006385608 Alpha: 0.9 Beta: 0.9 Lambda: 0.9 k: 2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that the value does not change and that's why only one entry is stored in the SortedMap but as just mentioned: is there any possibility to store all entries with values and parameters and to sort them like <code>SortedMap</code>? Can anyone help me solving this issue? Thanks.</p>

<p>Context: I have a WPF form which updates a row in a database. I do not want the user to be able to click the 'Update' button unless he/she has modified some form value. I am using the MVVM pattern and have 4 properties which can be updated (Name, Address, Telephone and Email). Unless the user changes one of these properties, I do not want the Update button enabled.</p>

<p>I checked for services, if there's anything heavy-weight in onReceive of the <code>BroadcastReceivers</code> but haven't found anything.</p>

<p>We use a <code>OnGlobalChangeLayoutListener</code>, which applied an <code>View.invalidate()</code> to work around a <code>WebView</code> repaint probelm which maybe could cause a draw-Looping. I removed it but still do get the problem. </p>

<p>Anyone maybe having the same problem and having an idea how to fix it or to isolate it? I'm pretty much out of ideas here and would love to understand what's going on here.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I forgot to mention: if this black screen problem happened the only way getting the app out of this is a forced stop of the application process. Otherwise the log lines get logged every time I try to start the app.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>A more detailed description of what is happening as requested: The black screen occurs very randomly. It always happens at start of the app and if happened only a force stop gets the app out of this. It seems to happen only after the app wasn't used for a longer and was probably swapped out of memory. And it looks like only Android 2.x devices are affected although I'm not sure with this.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong></p>

<p>I've added a button which calls <code>android.os.Process.killProcess(Process.myPid());</code> and if I call this again and again I've been able to reproduce it after some time, by starting the app and quitting it using the button. After some time (quite random), I get this right after quitting using the button:</p>

<pre><code>E/JavaBinder( 2704): !!! FAILED BINDER TRANSACTION !!!
</code></pre>

<p>followed by a:</p>

<pre><code>W/ActivityManager( 2704): Activity pause timeout for HistoryRecord{40976dd8 com.example.client.android/.ExampleMainActivity}
</code></pre>

<p>and next time I restart the app I just get a black screen and the log messages mentioned above. I've been unable to reproduce the same with an android 4.1 device, only with two 2.3 devices.</p>

<p>Googling around I found this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://androiddiscuss.com/1-android-discuss/42614.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://androiddiscuss.com/1-android-discuss/42614.html</a></p>

<p>suggesting the binder transaction buffer is somewhat exhausted. We use the MediaPlayer, InApp-Billing and Google Cloud Messages which use binding. I removed all of them and still get into this error. Maybe someone knows other hidden binder related stuff to check for?</p>

<p>This is the output array i stored in $data in php:</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [0] =&gt; Array
        (
            [name] =&gt; name
            [value] =&gt; sample text
        )

    [1] =&gt; Array
        (
            [name] =&gt; bdate
            [value] =&gt; sample date
        )

    [2] =&gt; Array
        (
            [name] =&gt; addr
            [value] =&gt; sample addr
        )

    [3] =&gt; Array
        (
            [name] =&gt; demo_des
            [value] =&gt; A
        )

    [4] =&gt; Array
        (
            [name] =&gt; demo_des
            [value] =&gt; B
        )
    [5] =&gt; Array
        (
            [name] =&gt; demo_des
            [value] =&gt; C
        )
)
</code></pre>

<p>and this is what id do:</p>

<pre><code>for($i=0;$i&lt;count($data);$i++){ //loop in $data
    if($data[$i][name]==$data[$i+1][name]||$data[$i][name]==$data[$i-1][name]){
        $impldval[] .= $data[$i][value];
        $impldkey[] .= $data[$i][name];
    }else{
        $arr[$data[$i][name]] .= $data[$i][value];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>basically I loop through data and check if data[num][name] is equal to next or previous, if it is then store it to an array and if not store it in different array..</p>

<p>Then I implode the duplicate values like this:</p>

<pre><code>if(is_array($impldkey)&amp;is_array($impldval)){$arr[$impldkey[0]] .= implode(',',$impldval);}
</code></pre>

<p>If we print $arr it will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [name] =&gt; sample text
    [bdate] =&gt; sample date
    [addr] =&gt; sample addr
    [demo_des] =&gt; A,B,C
)
</code></pre>

<p>This is correct, but the problem is what if the array with same name is not in order meaning the increment to check will not work:</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [0] =&gt; Array
        (
            [name] =&gt; name
            [value] =&gt; sample text
        )

    [1] =&gt; Array
        (
            [name] =&gt; demo_des
            [value] =&gt; A
        )

    [2] =&gt; Array
        (
            [name] =&gt; addr
            [value] =&gt; sample addr
        )

    [3] =&gt; Array
        (
            [name] =&gt; demo_des
            [value] =&gt; B
        )

    [4] =&gt; Array
        (
            [name] =&gt; bdate
            [value] =&gt; sample date
        )
    [5] =&gt; Array
        (
            [name] =&gt; demo_des
            [value] =&gt; C
        )
)
</code></pre>

<p>This will look like this because implode will also not work:</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [name] =&gt; sample text
    [bdate] =&gt; sample date
    [addr] =&gt; sample addr
    [demo_des] =&gt; ABC
)
</code></pre>

<p>Im sorry if this has been asked before, but when I search all they ask is 2 or more arrays to merge..</p>

<p>Any suggestions? Or other work around this...</p>

<p>EDIT:
Ok this is what I need to do, I need to convert the multi-dimentional array from serializeArray() to a single array and combine duplicate names and implode the values, like the example above, I loop through the array and add them to ""$arr"" but if it has duplicate then I store it in different array then implode it and add to ""$arr"".</p>

<li><p>Reviewing a merge request often throws feedback as to changes, more work to be completed. For this reason it's best to spend time reviewing merge requests early rather than merging them. We do not want developers completing a piece of work and waiting a long time for feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>We want work to be code reviewed as quickly as possible, whilst the merges and potential conflict resolution work can be postponed.</p></li>

<p>What is odd is that this same code works just fine when the port is configured for 115.2Kbps.  However, when running at 9600bps data that should be transmitted by this code seems to not get transmitted.  I have verified this by monitoring the receive flag on the remote device.  No exceptions are thrown from within the try statement.  Is there something else (Flush, etc.) that I should be doing to make sure the data is transmitted?

I visited <a href=""http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/node27.html"">this</a> page and <a href=""http://www.jimscode.ca/index.php/component/content/article/13-c/45-c-simple-mmap-example"">this</a> page to get some documentation, but the second one gives an obscure example regarding <code>mmap()</code>.</p>

<p>Being almost a newbie, and needing to share some information (in text form) between two processes, should I use the <code>shmget()</code> method or <code>mmap()</code>? And why?</p>

<p>Here is an example XML I'm attempting to parse: 
<a href=""http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.28331&amp;lon=-84.1435136&amp;unit=0&amp;lg=english&amp;FcstType=dwml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.28331&amp;lon=-84.1435136&amp;unit=0&amp;lg=english&amp;FcstType=dwml</a></p>

<p>Near the bottom of the XML, there is a segment:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;parameters applicable-location=""point1""&gt;
&lt;temperature type=""apparent"" units=""Fahrenheit"" time-layout=""k-p1h-n1-1""&gt;
&lt;value&gt;33&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/temperature&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The value I want is inside the value tag, but there are numerous value tags throughout the XML. How can I point and retrieve this specific one?</p>

<p>Thank you all!</p>

<p>Heres my implementation of your suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>while (xpp.getEventType()!=XmlPullParser.END_DOCUMENT) {
              if (xpp.getEventType()==XmlPullParser.START_TAG) {

When I try to login/register I get a 200 ok response with the plain user object visible in the chrome js console. Refreshing the page seems to lose this information even though I assumed that the service would store this at some point since it also has logout and currentUser methods.
<a href=""https://github.com/cloudspace/angular_devise"">https://github.com/cloudspace/angular_devise</a></p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>1) Is this service actually storing the user and if so how (i.e. with cookies or localstorage or in memory)?</p>

<p>2) If the service does not store the user how can I store this information in a custom cookie/localstorage and more importantly set the user into the service so that the services ""isauthenticated"" and ""currentuser"" methods can be used?</p>

<p><strong>Partial Library Readme Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Just register Devise as a dependency for your module. Then, the Auth service will be available for use.</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('myModule', ['Devise']).
    config(function(AuthProvider) {
        // Configure Auth service with AuthProvider
    }).
    controller('myCtrl', function(Auth) {
        // Use your configured Auth service.
    }); 
</code></pre>

<p>Auth.login(creds): Use Auth.login() to authenticate with the server. Keep in mind, credentials are sent in plaintext; use a SSL connection to secure them. creds is an object which should contain any credentials needed to authenticate with the server. Auth.login() will return a promise that will resolve to the logged-in user. See AuthProvider.parse() for parsing the user into a usable object.</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('myModule', ['Devise']).
    controller('myCtrl', function(Auth) {
        var credentials = {
            email: 'user@domain.com',
            password: 'password1'
        };

        Auth.login(credentials).then(function(user) {
            console.log(user); // =&gt; {id: 1, ect: '...'}
        }, function(error) {
            // Authentication failed...
        });

<p>When autocompletion is done, the formatted address will include the street number or not, depending on the user input but both entries will generate a success result.</p>

<p>Is it possible to never include the street number in the formatted address, even if it has been entered by the user during the completion? </p>

<p>As the street number is mandatory in my website and considering that this value is not mandatory during autocompletion, I will ask the user for it later anyway and, in the meantime, I have a hard time to manipulate formatted addresses that are not consistent (some have the number, others don't).</p>

<p>Ideally, I could get rid of the formatted address and consolidate my own format with ""route"", ""locality"" etc... but there are so many different addresses formats around the world that exist for some countries but not for others (states, provinces, regions,districts,...) that it is almost impossible to format something consistent on my own.</p>

<p>The formatted address <strong>is perfect as it is</strong> if only i could just get rid of the street number in order to add this information aside.</p>

<p>(Another acceptable solution would be to force the user to enter the street number or to generate a warning if this value is not entered. It would be fine with me too as long as the resulting formatted addresses always include the number or never do. Either way, I'm ok.
I'm just not ok with the inconsistency.</p>

"16403743","1","16404408","","2013-05-06 17:15:19","","5","234","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>I have an application that imports lab instrument data while it is running. This data is imported and then displayed in a <code>ListView</code> at an interval set by the end-user as per his or her testing requirements. When a value of interest appears in this <code>ListView</code> that they watch, they then press a Start button and the application begins performing calculations on that datum and subsequent data until a Stop button is pressed. So on the left side of the screen is a View for displaying the imported data and on the right side is another View for watching the values and statistics as they are calculated and displayed.</p>

<p><strong>The Current Code</strong></p>

<p>The View that displays the ListView where data is imported to is the ImportProcessView.xaml and it sets its <code>DataContext</code> to the <code>ImportProcessViewModel.cs</code>. The VM I've just introduced has a property <code>ObservableCollection&lt;IrData&gt;</code> that the ListView, I've also just described, binds to. Now to the interesting part...</p>

<p>The <code>ImportProcessView</code> has a <code>ContentControl</code> that sets it's content dynamically a UserControl representing the controls and fields specific to the type of Phase that is chosen by the end-user.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;StackPanel Background=""White"" Margin=""5""&gt;
    &lt;ContentControl Content=""{Binding CurrentPhaseView}""/&gt;
&lt;/StackPanel&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There are three <code>PhaseViews</code>, each in its own User Control and each sets it's <code>DataContext</code> to the <code>ImportProcessViewModel</code>. As a result I am getting some severe VM bloat to the tune of 2000 lines. Ridiculous. I know. The reason for the bloat is because the <code>ImporProcessViewModel</code> is maintaining state through properties for each of the three PhaseViews and not only that but contains methods for performing calculations whose data is stored and displayed in these ""PhaseViews"".</p>

<p><strong>What I am trying to achieve</strong></p>

<p>Obviously before the <code>ImportProcessViewModel</code> becomes more unwieldy, I need to break it up so that each PhaseView has its own ViewModel, but also such that each ViewModel maintains a relationship back to the ImportProcessViewModel for sake of the dependency imposed by the ObservableCollection of <code>IrData</code>.</p>

<p><strong>R&amp;D</strong></p>

<p>I've done my research on ViewModels communicating with each other, but most of the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4892731/wpf-mvvm-how-do-viewmodels-communicate-with-each-other"">results</a> involve applications that were written with a specific MVVM framework. I am not using a framework, and at this point in the project it would be too late to refactor it to start using one.</p>

<p>I did, however, find this <a href=""http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wpf/thread/acf78a7a-7f17-4437-8944-dd4e2d3dcdbb/"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> and the answer offered by 'hbarck' suggests something simple like composition to achieve the result I want, but since I don't have much experience with DataTemplates I don't understand what is meant when he/she suggests exposing <em>""the UserControl's ViewModel as a property on the main ViewModel, and bind a ContentControl to this property, which would then instantiate the View (i.e. the UserControl) through a DataTemplate""</em></p>

<p>Specifically, I don't understand what is meant by <em>""bind a ContentControl to this property which would then <strong>instantiate the View through a DataTemplate</strong>""</em>.</p>

<p>Can someone clarify by way of an code example what is meant by instantiating a view through a DataTemplate in the context of this example?</p>

<p>Additionally, is this a good approach (as suggested by 'hbarck')?</p>

<p>As one can see, I am already setting the Content property of a ContentControl to the Phase View that is to be instantiated. I just don't know know what involving a DataTemplate would look like.</p>

The code works fine and the user was successfully added to both groups.</p>

<p>While it did look OK and the username was listed as the member of the groups, they still cannot contribute. When I checked, they do have the anonymous access on the document library but not the Contribute permission. Here's my code:</p>

<p>(You can test it on a console application)</p>

<p>It worked, the user was added to ""Teachers"", but no permission on ""Teacher Documents"" document library. Adding the user to the admin group ""School Owners"" with full control on the site did not work either. Any help is appreciated, thank you very much.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
In my case, I have added the group manually to the document library, and users that are added manually to the group are granted permissions and allowed to contribute. By manually I mean using the standard ""Permissions"" function of the Sharepoint on the web browser.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shardable</strong> (can introduce more servers and spread out the keyspace between them)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Namespaced</strong> (there should be some mechanism to ""group"" keys together logically, for example by domain or associated concepts)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficient</strong> (try to use as little as possible space in the DB for keys, to allow for as much data as possible)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>As collision-less as possible</strong> (avoid keys for two different objects to be equal)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><br/>
Two alternatives that I have considered are these:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use prefixes for namespaces, separated by some character (like <code>human_resources:person:&lt;some_id&gt;</code>).The upside of this is that it is pretty scalable and easy to understand.  The downside would be possible conflicts depending on the separator (what if <code>id</code> has the character <code>:</code> in it?), and possibly size efficiency (too many nested namespaces might create very long keys).</p></li>
<li><p>Use some data structure (like Ordered Set or Hash) to store namespaces.  The main drawback to this would be loss of ""shardability"", since the structure to store the namespaces would need to be in a single database.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: What would be a good way to manage a keyspace in a sharded setup?  Should we use one these alternatives, or is there some other, better pattern that we have not considered?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>When I run the class, it is currently working exactly as I'd intended- and I continually get messages printed to the console displaying information about the PDUs being sent across the network, for as long as I leave it running.</p>

<p>However, I now want to access the information about the messages being sent over the network that this class is reading and displaying in the console, from another class- my Gui class, so that I can present this information to the user.</p>

<p>As I understand, in order for another class to be able to access the information collected by this class, I will need to define a method outside of my main method, and put all of this code into that method- as other classes cannot access another class' main method? Is this correct? Then call the new method from inside my main method?</p>

<p>I have done this by taking all of the code from inside my main method (as it is above) and putting it inside the following method instead: <code>public void receivePdu(){...}</code></p>

<p>I am then trying to call the <code>receivePdu()</code> method from my main method using the line <code>receivePdu();</code>, but I get an error that says ""Cannot make a static reference to the non- static method receivePdu() from the type EspduReceiver"", and suggests that I change modifier of 'receivePdu()' to 'static'"".</p>

<p>If I go ahead and make the change it recommends- that breaks the code in my <code>receivePdu()</code> method, which is now a <code>public static void</code> method, and I get a load of errors such as ""Cannot make a static reference to the non-static field socket, address, packet, pduFactory"".</p>

<p>Does anyone know why I'm getting the error on my <code>receivePdu();</code> call inside my main method, and how I should be doing it instead?</p>

<p>Thanks! </p>

<p><strong>Edit 16/04/2014 @ 11:35</strong></p>

This can be resource intensive, so as the artist pages don't change over a month period I put a CloudFront Distribution in front of it. </p>

<p>I thought this would mean no artist request ever had to be served more than once by my server however its not quite as good as that. This post explains that every edge location (Europe, US etc.) will get a miss the first time they look up the resource and that there is a limit to how many resources are kept in the cloudfront cache so they could be dropped.</p>

<p>So to counter this I have changed by server code to store a copy of the webpage in a bucket within S3 AND to check this first when a request comes in, so if the artist page already exists in S3 then the server retrieves it and returns its contents as the webpage. This greatly reduces the processing as it only constructs a webpage for a particular artist once. </p>

<p>However:</p>

<ol>
<li>The request still has to go to the server to check if the artist page exists.</li>
<li>If the artist page exists then the webpage (and they can sometimes be large up-to 20mb) is first downloaded to the server and then server returns the page.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I wanted to know if I could improve this - I know you can construct an S3 bucket as a redirect to another website. Is there a per-page way I could get the artist request to go to the S3 bucket and then have it return the page if it exists or call server if it does not?</p>

<p>Alternatively could I get the server to check if page exists and then redirect to the S3 page rather than download the page to the server first?</p>

<p>I've just started making a website using the Play Framework, but i've run into a problem.</p>

<p>I'am having a problem with properly setting up my layout, my layout currently looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>main.html -&gt; main markup of the page (includes header, body, etc...)

/templates/header.html -&gt; got includes to components (eg. show username is logged in etc)
/templates/body.html -&gt; this will be extended by the controller ""view"" 
/templates/footer.html -&gt; Also dynamic (data from database)

/components/Navigation.html
/components/userloggedin.html
/components/somemorerandomcomponents
</code></pre>

<p>The problem i'am having is, i include the header, body and the footer into the main.html. When i call the controller the body gets rendered and ""printend"" in the body.html. But i want the header and footer to be rendered each call aswell, How can i achieve this in Play?</p>

<p>I prefer not to use inline code, so i prefer to call an object which returns the data(eg. username etc.). I've read something about Tags and i was wondering if that is what iam looking for (couldn't really figure it out) and if so, can someone please quickly explain how to implement them?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT:: </p>

<p>What i would like to have is the following: 
lets take the header.html as example. I want the header.html to be filled with dynamic ""data"", data retreived from a database. </p>

<p>I really dont wanna use inline java code to connect to a databas etc, that is why i was wondering if i can call some sort of object from within my view to fill the header.html with the dynamic generated content. </p>

<p>I've did some more research and maybe the way to go is, to make an Header model object and inject that into the template and then call that object in the view like:</p>

<pre><code>#{header.Name /}
</code></pre>

<p>and inject it like:</p>

<pre><code>render(header, body, footer);
</code></pre>

<p>Please correct me if iam wrong thanks!</p>

<pre><code>public class ChartItemClass
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public double Value { get; set; }
    public string Url { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can get a Chart to display the Name (X-axis) and Value (Y-axis) correctly, but I would like the labels on the X-axis to be HyperlinkButtons to the Url property.  The X-axis label should be something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;HyperlinkButton Content=""*Name Property Here*"" NavigateUri=""*Url Property Here*"" TargetName=""_blank""&gt;&lt;/HyperlinkButton&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I found an example which allowed me to set the AxisLabelStyle for the X-axis so the Labels are now HyperlinkButtons.  The problem is I haven't been able to assign/bind the Url property as the NavigateUri.  Any ideas?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to the templated styles, you can create your own
  notification styles using any remote View.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do do this? I believe to do this you need to create a custom <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Style.html"">Notification.Style</a>. It's an abstract class so I it needs to be extended. I haven't been able to find any documentation on which parts need to be extended. </p>

<p>This <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6391870/how-exactly-to-use-notification-builder"">SO question</a> gives a good example of how to use the notificaiton.builder for basic notificaitons, I'm using this as a starting point. Adding </p>

<pre><code>.setContent(new RemoteViews(getPackageName(), R.layout.notification)) 
</code></pre>

<p>adds a custom view for basic notifications, but it's not expandable. </p>

I parsed the file containing the private key using PEMParser provided by bouncy castle. I got PKCS8EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo object. I am unable to get the PrivateKeyInfo object from this.
I am getting the following exception while trying to decrypt.</p>

<p>org.bouncycastle.pkcs.PKCSException: unable to read encrypted data: 1.2.840.113549.1.5.13 not available: No such provider: 1.2.840.113549.1.5.13</p>

<p>here is the code which i used</p>

<pre><code>PEMParser parser = new PEMParser(br);
PKCS8EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo pair =       (PKCS8EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo)parser.readObject();
JceOpenSSLPKCS8DecryptorProviderBuilder jce = new JceOpenSSLPKCS8DecryptorProviderBuilder();
                jce.setProvider(""1.2.840.113549.1.5.13"");
                InputDecryptorProvider decProv = jce.build(password.toCharArray());
                PrivateKeyInfo info = pair.decryptPrivateKeyInfo(decProv);
