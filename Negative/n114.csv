<p>However according to the output in the book the thread with high priority should have higher value for the variable clicker. But in my case the values for the variable clicker is much higher for the lower priority thread than for the higher priority one.The output is like below for me:-</p>

<pre><code>hi = 2198713135 lo=2484053552

<p>Does this not mean that lower priority thread got more CPU time than the higher priority one...Am i missing something..The results are the same(higher clicker value for the lower priority thread) on both ubuntu and win7...</p>

<p>Files are uploading into these folders and are web accessible. At this time I want to add some permissions to access them. If someone tries to access <code>myapp/system/attachments/meetings/doc1.docx</code> I want to ensure they are authenticate with the application. For another <code>myapp/system/attachments/Project/doc2.docx</code> I may want to check that the user has a certain role.</p>

<p>My thought was to setup some Rack Middleware to accomplish this, when I did this my middleware appears to handle all my requests expect for those is /system</p>

<p>Is there a configuration setting I can change to allow my Middleware to also interact with /system paths.</p>

<p>Is there a better, easier way to accomplish what I'm looking to do?
Essentially a route or something if path is like '/system/attachment/project/' run this block of logic. This logic may be somewhat complex and will require access to models and environment stuff.  It will then ultimately return the response of the file content or fail/redirect to insufficient permissions.</p>

I started with an Empty ASP.NET project in VS2015 community, tried to add a couple packages based on a tutorial, and haven't gotten it to actually work yet. The initial problem in the linked question was due to some project dependencies using <code>beta5</code> and some using <code>beta7</code>. Matching those up solved that, but now I get this error when I try to run the project in IIS Express:</p>

<pre><code>Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Dnx.Host.Clr' or one of its  dependencies.
</code></pre>

<p>I think the problem is still version related--like the previous <code>web.config</code> assembly reference issues--but I don't know how to deal with it yet. I tried modifying <code>global.json</code> based on a similar issue I found on GitHub, but now it doesn't build. It looks like it can't find the newer version of the CLR I guess. From the Error List in VS2015:</p>

<pre><code>The dependency Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc &gt;= 6.0.0-beta7 could not be resolved.
The dependency Microsoft.AspNet.Server.IIS &gt;= 1.0.0-beta7 could not be resolved.
The dependency Microsoft.AspNet.Server.WebListener &gt;= 1.0.0-beta7 could not be resolved.

    ""version"": ""1.0.0-beta7"",
    ""runtime"": ""clr"",
    ""architecture"": ""x86""
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My project's References tree has yellow error indicators but looking in the NuGet package manager for my project doesn't show any upgrades (or anything installed at all, as far as I can tell).</p>

I've used stackoverflow for many problems but this is the first time I couldnt already find an answer to my problem. So, if I'm doing something wrong please let me know and I'll repost / edit the question. </p>

<p>Now unto business. I've just recently started development w/ the Android SDK and I'm following the basic tutorial from <a href=""http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/hello-world.html#avd"">http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/hello-world.html#avd</a>
I've gotten up the xml editting part and when I make all the changes to the xml files main.xml and strings.xml this error occurs. Also, when I compile the project, the compilation process generates a main.out.xml file that is empty. I don't know what it is or its purpose. </p>

<p>The error:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>My project is setup for platform: Android 2.3.3 API Level: 10</p>

<p>I don't know if it makes a difference or not but I'm using my Android Incredible for running/debugging the application not a Android Virtual Device. If there is any more information needed let me know and I'll post it ASAP.</p>

<p>[self buildmap] uses sqlite to retreive the map from the database, i'm looping with a while loop and this is causing the crash. It loops about 20-25 times (of 600) Before crashing.</p>

<p>Within the loop I'm creating a new block (SKSpriteNode subclass) that places the block at an certain position with some information (position, name, physics and such, no Heavy stuff). I was using NSMutableArray to store the blocks for easy access and thought that this was the problem at first, but when I remove the [blockArray addObject:block]; the app still crashes.</p>

<p>If I remove every bit of code in the -(void)buildmap the app doesn't crash.</p>

<p><strong>Is there something with dispatch_async and the while loop that might cause this?</strong></p>

<p>In the OpenGL Superbible book there is code:</p>

<pre><code>color = texelFetch(s, ivec2(gl_FragCoord.xy), 0);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>glFragCoord</strong> “This variable is an input to the fragment shader that holds the <strong>floating-point coordinate</strong> of the fragment being processed in window coordinates. However, the texelFetch function accepts integer-point coordinates that range <strong>from (0, 0)</strong> to the <strong>width and height</strong> of the texture.”</p>

<p>“Therefore, we construct a two-component integer vector (ivec2) from the x and y components of gl_FragCoord.""</p>

<p>However, when I went to deploy on a local server, they are only running Windows 2003, and the framework on it is still 2.0.</p>

<p>I talked to the guy in charge and informed him that I am using a lot of Linq commands and it would be very hard for me to rewrite all of that code, so he agreed to upgrade to 4.0 for me (the latest framework server 2003 can handle).</p>

<p>So I converted all of my projects to target 4.0, ran it in debug mode and the service (running as an application) runs fine.</p>

<p>The service installs fine (installutil.exe servicename.exe) but when I do a ""net start"" on it, it <em>immediately</em> returns ""the service is not responding to the control function."" I get no other useful information from the event logs.</p>

<p>As I understand it, this usually means that it has taken too long to start up, but the timeout is definitely set to 30000ms and it returns this well under a second. Nothing has changed other than converting the projects to framework 4.0 and I can find no information about ""downgrading"" from 4.5 to 4.0 and what I might be missing.</p>

Initially I created an instance for that progress control and in the <code>OnInitDialog()</code>. I am trying change the color of the progress bar (initially the progress bar color is green). Now, I tried setting the bar color to red using this piece of code in the <code>OnInitDialog()</code> as follows,</p>

    CPropertyPage::OnInitDialog();
    m_ProgressBar-&gt;SetRange32(0,100);

<p>This is the thing I had to change the bar color, and I am using Windows 7 OS. One thing what I observed is when I changed the theme to ""windows classic"" then I am able to see the color I have set (in this case red). But again if I get back to the Windows 7 aero theme the color is green again.</p>

<p>Moreover I even checked the <code>SetBkColor</code> method here and it has the same issue that I faced when I used <code>SetBarColor()</code>.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest a possible way to change the bar color in all themes (I think that would be fine if it supported all kinds of themes)?</p>

<p>Each parent can only have two children, so the next one will have to be his grandson and so on. (From left to right)</p>

<p>I am quite sure I don't duplicate the symbol. I think this might be due to the fact that Unity imports FMODs itself and that the two might be colliding... But if this is the case, I am surprised that FMOD_System_CreateSound is the first one to get caught. Is there a way around this? thx!</p>

<p>EDIT:
The conflict was caused by iOS not allowing functions to have the same name even though they don't have the same signature. After removing the same-named functions (thus removing some FMOD features that I didn't need), I can compile to iOS, but as expected, I still get an error when Initializing because FMOD is already initialized by Unity.</p>

1.  The method passes the formal array parameters listA and listB, then return the concatenated array listC.

This was a homework assignment and after rereading it I believe the no return type was an error because of what he said in question 1. Basically saying to return list c by using parameters listB and ListA. There were several other typos before that he has since corrected. He also gave us array1 and array 2 for our test class with values, but no array 3.</p>

<p>While, if I put the code into a java file outside of my Eclipse project and compile and run it via command line, everything is fine and the frame shows up.
Can anybody help me troubleshooting?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>the code now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>import javax.swing.*;

public class TestFrame {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                createAndShowGUI();
            }

            private void createAndShowGUI() {
                JFrame frame = new JFrame(""Test"");
                System.out.println(SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread());
                frame.getContentPane().add(new JButton(""hello""));
                frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
                frame.pack();
                frame.setVisible(true);
            }
        });

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This does not solve the problem (as already mentioned by user DSquare). I figured out that it seems to be a problem with that specific Eclipse project. If I create a new Eclipse project (same Eclipse), the code runs without an error message and the frame shows up. I still don't have a clue which project cnfigurations may cause it. I don't have swt.jar in my classpath (though org.eclipse.swt and org.eclipse.swt.cocoa.macosx.x86_64 in my plugin-dependencies).</p>

I've read <a href=""http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-create-wordpress-widgets/"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> and I believe I've grasped the basic usage of how to create a custom widget. </p>

<p>Now my question is how I can create multiple widgets dynamically based on predefined options. One way I can think of is to use <code>eval()</code> to declare each extended class but as the class gets bigger, it would be too complicated. I don't think I can handle the php code passed as a function parameter; it's too much work to escape characters. Also it is said that using eval() is not safe and should be avoided if possible. </p>

<p>The code below is ready to run as a plugin. Just add a header comment and activate it and you'll see the two widgets are added. </p>

<pre><code>add_action( 'widgets_init', 'load_mywidgets');
function load_mywidgets() {

    // prepare widgets
    $arrWidgets = array(
        array('id' =&gt; 'Bar', 'description' =&gt; 'This is a description for Bar', 'title' =&gt; 'This is Bar'),
        array('id' =&gt; 'Foo', 'description' =&gt; 'This is a description for Foo', 'title' =&gt; 'This is Foo')
    );

    // define widget class(es) 
    foreach ($arrWidgets as $arrWidget) {
        eval('
            class ' . $arrWidget[""id""] . ' extends WP_Widget {

                function ' . $arrWidget[""id""] . '() {
                    $widget_ops = array(""classname"" =&gt; ""' . $arrWidget[""id""] . '""
                                        , ""description"" =&gt; ""' . $arrWidget[""description""] . '"" );
                    $this-&gt;WP_Widget(""' . $arrWidget[""id""] . '"", ""' . $arrWidget[""title""] . '"", $widget_ops);           
                }

                function form($instance) {
                    $instance = wp_parse_args( (array) $instance, array( ""title"" =&gt; """" ) );
                    $title = $instance[""title""];
                    echo ""&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=\"""" . $this-&gt;get_field_id(""title"") . ""\""&gt;Title: &lt;input class=\""widefat\"" id=\"""";
                    echo $this-&gt;get_field_id(""title"") . ""\"" name=\"""" . $this-&gt;get_field_name(""title"") . ""\"" type=\""text\"" value=\"""" . attribute_escape($title) . ""\"" /&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"";
                }

                function update($new_instance, $old_instance) {
                    $instance = $old_instance;
                    $instance[""title""] = $new_instance[""title""];
                    return $instance;
                }

                function widget($args, $instance) {
                    extract($args, EXTR_SKIP);

                    echo $before_widget;
                    $title = empty($instance[""title""]) ? "" "" : apply_filters(""widget_title"", $instance[""title""]);

                    if (!empty($title))
                        echo $before_title . $title . $after_title;

                    // WIDGET CODE GOES HERE
                    echo ""&lt;h1&gt;This is my new widget!&lt;/h1&gt;"";

                    echo $after_widget;
                }           
            }
        ');
        register_widget($arrWidget[""id""]);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a simpler way of doing this? I think passing the options to the parameters of the constructor when instantiating the class much more makes sense. But as I view the core, the constructor is already defined and wondering how I can overwrite it. It appears that the WP_Widget is not designed to be instantiated. </p>

<p>Thanks for your info.</p>

<p>[Edit]
Found a similar issue here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11226116/widget-create-dynamiclly-in-wordpress-plugin"">widget create dynamiclly in wordpress plugin</a>
But the suggested solution also uses <code>eval()</code> and basically it is the same way I presented above. As I keep reading the core, it appears <code>register_widget()</code> only accepts a class name for the parameter, calling <code>WP_Widget_Factory::register()</code>. So <code>eval()</code> may be the only way to do this. But it's not intuitive. I'm still looking for a simpler way of doing this.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>...and it works (produces the content of an iframe, in this case). However, if I use the same procedure to add some javascript in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> (or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>), e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=\""text/javascript\""&gt;swfobject.embedSWF(\""flash.swf\"", \""my_flash\"");&lt;/script&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>...I get error <code>unterminated string literal</code> at <code>var baseContent = '</code>.   How do I include javascript in <code>var baseContent</code>?</p>

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<p>@TamarG I tried the suggestions below but no luck - see: <a href=""http://www.casedasole.it/fancybox/js/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.casedasole.it/fancybox/js/index.html</a>. I need to include in <code>var baseContent</code> both a link to an external javascript file (swobject.js) and its related  javascript in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. But adding <code>&lt;script type=\""text/javascript\"" src=\""swfobject.js\""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> to <code>var baseContent</code> stops the iframe loading, with the same error: <code>unterminated string literal</code> at <code>var baseContent = '</code>.   </p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> (reply to below)</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/mLq9oywt/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>JSFiddle</strong></a> referred to in my question shows how fancybox can be used to open an iframe on page-load. The content of the iframe is encoded in the ""launch"" page (unusual, because usually fancybox iframes load a separate HTML file, image, video etc). </p>

<p>In the JSFiddle example, <code>var baseContent</code> contains a sample of HTML that can be used to create the iframe content (<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, etc). Encoding the basic HTML in <code>var baseContent</code> looks easy - e.g. <code>&lt;style type=""text/css""&gt;</code> becomes <code>&lt;style type=\""text/css\""&gt;</code>. </p>

<p>But I also need the iframe <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> to link to an external swfobject.js file and to include the standard 2-line swfobject flash detection script, <code>swfobject.embedSWF(""flash.swf"", ""my_flash""</code>, etc. </p>

<p>But when I use the same approach that works with the other HTML tags to encode the javascript tags, i.e. encode <code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""swfobject.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> as <code>&lt;script type=\""text/javascript\"" src=\""swfobject.js\""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>, there is an error and the iframe won't open on page-load - <a href=""http://www.casedasole.it/fancybox/js/index+js.html"" rel=""nofollow"">see this page</a>.   </p>

<p>So my question is how to format links to external js files in <code>var baseContent</code> (and then, once that's working, how to format js in the <code>var baseContent</code> itself).             </p>

"19470749","1","","","2013-10-19 20:23:42","","0","1456","<p>I follow the simple collision detection method of using the bounding box method, and checking whether they intersect. </p>

<p>The code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>CCRect projectileRect = projectileSprite-&gt;boundingBox();      
CCRect enemyRect = enemySprite-&gt;boundingBox();

if (projectileRect.intersectsRect(enemyRect)) {
    // do stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: I tried creating my own bounding box as well by getting the x, y positions and adding the width and height of the sprite.</p>

<p>Now, a funny thing happens is that is the collision detection works, but it works a bit incorrectly. The collision detection gets detected, before the actual intersection takes place. </p>

<p>I verified this by switching on CC_SPRITE_DEBUG_DRAW and it indeed takes place a few moments before the collision happens, i.e. the projectile's bounding box is outside the enemy's bounding box. </p>

<p>This seems to be a basic functionality that most folks recommend, and I seemed to be missing something. Can anyone deduce, what I could possibly be doing wrong?</p>

<p>PS: I verified this with cocos2d-x-2.2 and cocos2d-2.1rc0-x-2.1.3.</p>

<p>PPS: On a side note, I tried to draw my own bounding box using ccDrawSolidRect, but I can't seem to get that working.</p>

I am trying to make it so that if someone adds products to their cart without being logged in the items are added to a cookie cart. Then if the user logs in, the cart is added to their account in the database and synced.</p>

<p>However, I am having an issue.  If someone adds items to their cart before being logged on, the items are indeed transferred to their cart upon logging in (they are added to the database). However, this change is not reflected until some change is made while they are logged in. </p>

<p>So, for example, if someone adds 5 items to their cart before logging in, and then logged in, it would show no items in their cart. Then after adding a single item to their cart, it would show 6 items.  Is there a way to avoid this?</p>

      }, function (httpError) {

      });
    }

    ...

    var user = {

      login: login,
      checkToken: checkToken,
      getUser: getUser,
      currentUser: null
    };

<pre><code>angular.module('nightwalkerApp')
  .controller('AccountCtrl', function ($scope, $location, UserFactory) {
    if (!UserFactory.checkToken()) {

    }
    $scope.user = UserFactory.currentUser;
    $scope.logout = UserFactory.logout;
    $scope.$watch(function () {
      return UserFactory.currentUser;

<p>Question 1:  If I do this, does game center have the ability to show all results for all leader boards on one leader board?  Meaning, I can allow users to see if they are top in their continent, but then also allow them to check their ranking overall.  Possible?</p>

<p>Question 2:  Since my app is Universal, is there a way to force the standard GC Leader board on the iPad to full screen?  I have played around with the GKLeaderBoardViewController view.bounds and although this does allow me change the size, it still maintains the original border of the default size.  Meaning, there is a square box around the middle of the view, but the data is actually expanded like it should be. (I wish I knew how to include pics here)  Have also used the modelPresentationStyle but same results with the box around a smaller portion of the screen.</p>

<p>Finally, concerning both questions above, is it just better to create your own custom view?  I was hoping to avoid this especially since the newer look from iOS 5 Leader boards are actually very nice.</p>

I can do basic functions like play sounds and write new sound files, but I would like to start on a multitrack recorder. I can create multiple waveforms but I'm not sure how to label the ""sound"" properties in them to be independent from each other. I currently have a function that should create a new sound object and a new waveform to go with it, but they share the same sound name. So i guess my question is how do I dynamically create sound objects to operate independently from each other in order to create multiple tracks within the same session?</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>from tkinter import *
from tkSnack import *

root = Tk()
initializeSnack(root)

snd = Sound()

def start():
    snd.record()


def stop():
    snd.stop()


def save():
    file = root.tk.call('eval', 'snack::getSaveFile')
    snd.write(file)


def track():
    c = SnackCanvas(height=100, width=1920, bg='white')
    c.pack()
    c.create_waveform(1, 1, sound=snd, width=1920, height=100, pixelspersec=500)
    mButton = Button(root, text='Record', command=start).pack()
    saveB = Button(root, text='save', command=save).pack()


root.geometry('1920x800')

mButton1 = Button(root, text='Stop', command=stop).pack()

mButton2 = Button(root, text='Add Track', command=track).pack()

For this I have made my own subclass of Tab, EditableTab, which has functionality for changing the name of the tab by double clicking on the name in the overview. When the user clicks the + sign to create a new contact list, I want the program to create a new tab, select it, then focus the name and select all the text - it is natural to name the contact list at once (similar to when you create a new file in windows). </p>

<p>My problem: This seems to be very unstable. Most of the times, it seems some kind of animation/transition problem arises, and the tab name ends up empty. Here is a screenshot of what <em>usually, but not always,</em> happens when the + button is clicked: <img src=""http://i.imgur.com/YNxKilt.jpg"" alt=""screenshot""></p>

<p>And here is what I want: <img src=""http://i.imgur.com/V1nRmPS.jpg"" alt=""screenshot2""></p>

<p>Here is the code for my EditableTab:</p>

<pre><code>public class EditableTab extends Tab {

private Label lbl;
private TextField txtField;

public EditableTab(String text, Node content) {
    super();
    setContent(content);
    lbl = new Label(text);
    txtField = new TextField(text);
    txtField.setStyle(""-fx-background-color: transparent"");
    setGraphic(lbl);
    setupInteractivity();
}

public TextField getTextField() {
    return txtField;
}

private void setupInteractivity() {
    lbl.setOnMouseClicked((mouseEvent) -&gt; {
        if (mouseEvent.getClickCount() == 2) {
            showTextField();
        }
    });

    txtField.setOnAction(event -&gt; setGraphic(lbl));

    txtField.focusedProperty().addListener(
            (observable, oldValue, newValue) -&gt; {
        if (! newValue) {
            lbl.setText(txtField.getText());
            setGraphic(lbl);
        }
    });
}

public void showTextField() {
    txtField.setPrefWidth(lbl.getWidth());
    txtField.setText(lbl.getText());
    setGraphic(txtField);
    txtField.selectAll();
    txtField.requestFocus();
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>And here is the code where the functionality is implemented:</p>

<pre><code>private void addNewContactlist() {
    Contactlist newList = new Contactlist();
    newList.setName(""New contact list"");
    contactlistApp.getContactlistData().add(newList);
    ListView&lt;Person&gt; lv = new ListView&lt;Person&gt;(newList.getContacts());
    setupListView(lv);
    int position = tabPane.getTabs().size() - 1;
    EditableTab tab = createEditableTab(""New contact list"", lv);
    tabPane.getTabs().add(position, tab);
    tabPane.getSelectionModel().select(tab);
    tab.showTextField();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I suspect that the problem comes from some animation/transition timings, but that is really just a guess. I tried wrapping the <code>showTextField()</code> call in a <code>Platform.runLater()</code> with no luck.</p>

<p>Here is a small test app to replicate the issue:</p>

<pre><code>public class TestApp extends Application {

TabPane tabPane = new TabPane();

@Override
public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
    Tab addNewContactlistTab = new Tab();
    addNewContactlistTab.setClosable(false);
    Label lbl = new Label(""\u2795"");

    lbl.setOnMouseClicked(mouseEvent -&gt; {
        if (tabPane.getTabs().size() == 1) {
            addNewTab();
        }
    });

    addNewContactlistTab.setGraphic(lbl);
    tabPane.getTabs().add(addNewContactlistTab);

    addNewContactlistTab.selectedProperty().addListener(
            (observable, oldValue, newValue) -&gt; {
        if (newValue &amp;&amp; tabPane.getTabs().size() != 1) {
            addNewTab();
        }
    });

    Scene scene = new Scene(tabPane);
    primaryStage.setScene(scene);
    primaryStage.setWidth(600);
    primaryStage.setHeight(400);
    primaryStage.show();
}

private void addNewTab() {
    int insertionIndex = tabPane.getTabs().size() - 1;
    ListView&lt;String&gt; lv = new ListView&lt;String&gt;();
    EditableTab tab = new EditableTab(""Unnamed"", lv);
    tabPane.getTabs().add(insertionIndex, tab);

<p>Let's pretend that I have two tables in an <strong>InnoDB</strong> database: <code>categories</code> and <code>jokes</code>; and that I'm using <strong>PHP/MySQLi</strong> to do the work. The tables look like so:</p>

<pre><code>CATEGORIES
id (int, primary, auto_inc)  |  category_name (varchar[64])
============================================================
1                               knock, knock

JOKES
id (int, primary, auto_inc)  |  category_id (int)  | joke_text (varchar[255])
=============================================================================
empty
</code></pre>

<p>Here are two functions, each of which is being called by <strong>a different connection, at the same time</strong>. The calls are: <code>delete_category(1)</code> and <code>add_joke(1,""Interrupting cow. Interrup-MOOOOOOOO!"")</code></p>

<pre><code>function delete_category($category_id) {

    // only delete the category if there are no jokes in it
    $query = ""SELECT id FROM jokes WHERE category_id = '$category_id'"";
    $result = $conn-&gt;query($query);

    if ( !$result-&gt;num_rows ) {
        $query = ""DELETE FROM categories WHERE id = '$category_id'"";
        $result = $conn-&gt;query($query);
        if ( $conn-&gt;affected_rows ) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
}

function add_joke($category_id,$joke_text) {

    $new_id = -1;

    // only add the joke if the category exists
    $query = ""SELECT id FROM categories WHERE id = '$category_id'"";
    $result = $conn-&gt;query($query);

    if ( $result-&gt;num_rows ) {

        $query = ""INSERT INTO jokes (joke_text) VALUES ('$joke_text')"";
        $result = $conn-&gt;query($query);

        if ( $conn-&gt;affected_rows ) {
            $new_id = $conn-&gt;insert_id;
            return $new_id;
        }
    }

    return $new_id;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if the <code>SELECT</code> statements from both functions execute at the same time, and proceed from there, <code>delete_category</code> will think it's okay to delete the category, and <code>add_joke</code> will think it's okay to add the joke to the existing category, so I'll get an empty <code>categories</code> table and an entry in the <code>joke</code> table that references a non-existent <code>category_id</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Without using foreign keys, how would you solve this problem?</strong></p>

<p>My best thought so far would be to do the following:</p>

<p>1) <code>""LOCK TABLES categories WRITE, jokes WRITE""</code> at the start of <code>delete_category</code>. However, since I'm using InnoDB, I'm quite keen to avoid locking entire tables (especially main ones that will be used often).</p>

<p>2) Making <code>add_joke</code> a transaction and then doing <code>""SELECT id FROM categories WHERE id = '$category_id'""</code> <em>after</em> inserting the record as well. If it doesn't exist at that point, rollback the transaction. However, since the two <code>SELECT</code> statements in <code>add_joke</code> might return different results, I believe I need to look into transaction isolation levels, which I'm not familiar with.</p>

<p>It seems to me that if I did both of those things, it should work as expected. Nevertheless, I'm keen to hear more informed opinions. Thanks.</p>

<p>My wordIndex contains multiple linked lists that contains the word ""algorithms"", so I wrote the following code to see if my hashmap is able to find the word ""algorithms""</p>

<pre><code>String getWord(String query) { //query=user input in this case algorithms

    if(wordIndex.containsValue(query.toLowerCase()))
    {
        return ""hello"";          //should return hello if word is found
    }
    else
    {
        return ""none"";
    }       
}
</code></pre>

<p>However it is always returning none, which means it can find the word in the linked list.
So what is the correct procedure to traverse through linked Lists inside Hashmaps. I searched but couldn't find any answer.</p>

<p>Also I need to return all the KEYS, containing the query word (in this case ""algorithm""). I cant seem to find a function in the hashmap class that can do that(or maybe I saw it but didn't understand it). I am new to hashmaps could you guys please help me out and point me in the right direction.</p>

<p>I have several lists of objects that I serialize in json and that I put in the session. The objects have several properties, including an ID and a date. At another point, I need to loop through these lists to find out if one of the lists contains one of the objects I'm looking for by ID.</p>

<p>The key I use to store my json includes a date; like this:</p>

<pre><code>var TheData = JSON.stringify(TheListOfMyObjects);
var SessionKey = 'TheListOfObjectsFor' + TheMonth + ""."" + TheDay + ""."" + TheYear;
localStorage.setItem(SessionKey, TheData);
</code></pre>

<p>Now I need to check if in the session there's an object with a certain ID. I don't know the date property of the object, just its ID. I also don't know which dates have a value in the session or not.</p>

<p>How could I find my object by ID? It'd be nice if I could load the session in memory so that I could loop through it.</p>

In storyboard, as long as the autosizing mask is set correctly, the frames for the views are generated dynamically to fill the entire screen. This can be shown when the 'Apply <em>Alternate Device</em> Form Factor' button in storyboard is pressed and the screen size &amp; content grow or shrink dynamically.  However, whenever I try to get this same behavior while creating views programmatically,  the frame does not scale dynamically. Is there any way to generate this frame automatically like Storyboard based on the current devices framework? Is there any elegant solution to programmatically create views for different size devices without needing to manually manage static frames for each devices? Does anyone have any resources they could share or examples that they could provide?</p>

It is called ""content"" with ""content_container"" wrapped around it and finally, ""page"" around that. If you click the bottom left or right arrows you will see other DIVs with the same tags but they are properly vertically aligned. The closest I got to maybe fixing it is when I inspected the first carousel element (the one at the top) and saw it was indeed height:100%; like it should. However, if you go to the right or left and inspect the other DIVs they also have height:100%; When you uncheck height:100%; the DIV moves to the top. The only idea I have is that perhaps another DIV around page isn't letting ""page"" become height:100% when first loading the page. Other than that I'm 100% lost.</p>

<p>You CANNOT look in the source code because with Tumblr themes you are creating the code separate for each post, so if you look at the source code from your perspective the code is not what it looks like on my end. The entire themes code is below: P.S: Text and Quote posts are the only posts that are vertically aligned, so please look at those. I'm posting the entire code incase I have made a mistake that prevents height:100%; from loading.</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a reference to the node that will be removed (<code>ChildNode</code>)</li>
<li>Get a reference to the node's parent using the <code>ChildNode.ParentNode</code> property (<code>ParentNode</code>)</li>
<li>Call the <code>ParentNode.RemoveChild(ChildNode)</code> method</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, this works great if the child node is a <code>XmlElement</code>, but what if the child node was a XML <em>attribute</em>? According to the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlnode.parentnode.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN documentation</a> for <code>XmlNode.ParentNode</code>, the property would return <code>nothing</code>, because ""<em>[attributes] do not have parents.</em>""</p>

<p>Attributes most definitely do have ""parents,"" do they not? An attribute must be assigned to a XML element, so the XML element would be the attribute's parent, in my mind.</p>

<p>Can someone clear up my misunderstanding, or clarify why the .NET Framework does not see attributes as having parents?</p>

<p>In the IconItemRenderer I add a check mark:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;s:IconItemRenderer xmlns:fx=""http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009""

    if(!checkMarkImage &amp;&amp; data.isChecked) {
        //create image holder
        imageHolder = new Group;
        addChild(imageHolder);

        //create image
        checkMarkImage = new BitmapImage();
        checkMarkImage.source = checkBoxSource;

        imageHolder.addElement(checkMarkImage);
    } 
    //delete checkmark
    else if(checkMarkImage &amp;&amp; !data.isChecked) {
        removeChild(imageHolder);
        imageHolder = null;
        checkMarkImage = null;
    }

    super.commitProperties();
}

override protected function layoutContents(w:Number, h:Number):void
{
    super.layoutContents(w, h);

    //layout the checkmark
    if(checkMarkImage) {
        // don't do it like this! (see correct answer)
        checkMarkImage.x = w-40;
        checkMarkImage.y = 14;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The list change handler sets the mark on the selected item and removes it from the old one. After this is done it calls popView(), but when you come again to this view the list gets created in the views addHandler and when you start scrolling the list behaves as mentioned above.</p>

<pre><code>//list change
protected function myList_changeHandler(event:IndexChangeEvent):void
{
    //is already selected?
    var item:Object = myList.selectedItem;
    if(!item.isChecked) {
        //deselect the other one?
        var length:int = myList.dataProvider.length;
        var oldItem:Object;
        for(var i:int = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
            oldItem = myList.dataProvider.getItemAt(i);
            if(oldItem.isChecked) {
                oldItem.isChecked = false;
                myList.dataProvider.itemUpdated(oldItem);
                break;
            }
        }

        //select new one
        item.isChecked = true;
        myList.dataProvider.itemUpdated(item);
    }

    //pop view
    navigator.popView();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think the problem is in the myList.dataProvider.itemUpdated(oldItem), apperently the renderer thinks it has to redraw everthing, but I have no idea why.. and why only after the view is shown again...?</p>

<p>Any ideas if it's a bug or something? how can I get rid of this bahavior or how can I debug this this properly? thanks</p>

<p>I've accomplished an 1 to 1 relationship, it's fairly simple. But how can I specify to doctrine that when I want to <strong>create</strong> an user, the item can be null? <strong>(and not to insert a new row and just leave id_item null)</strong></p>

<p>And of course, I created ItemsTypeForm class, and added the type in my userstypeform class:</p>

<pre><code>// UsersTypeForm Class

<p>When I add a new user, everything goes fine. The user is inserted as well as the item. But when I try to <strong>add</strong> an user where it has no item (<strong>user item fields are blank</strong>), I get the following error:</p>

<p><strong>It is trying to insert the item, with null values.</strong></p>

<li><code>ListView</code> with <code>Checkbox</code> and a <code>TextView</code> saying the projects of each Client;</li>
</ul>

<p>Each Client has is own Projects and the idea is to update the <code>ListView</code> to show each client projects when selecting them in the <code>Spinner</code>, e.g: </p>

<ol>
<li><code>Client A</code> -> Project 1, Project 2, Project 3, (...), Project 7; </li>
<li><code>Client B</code> -> Project 8, Project 9, (...), Project 16.</li>
</ol>

<p>For this I use a <code>Base Adapter</code> refering to a <code>single_row.xml</code> to set the layout for each view.</p>

<p>The information about the clients is set on an array called <code>clientes_array</code> in the <code>strings.xml</code> file. There I also have arrays for the <code>projectsA</code> and <code>projectsB</code>.</p>

<p><code>strings.xml</code>:</p>

<p><code>&lt;string-array name=""clientes_array""&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Cliente A&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Cliente B&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Cliente C&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Cliente D&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/string-array&gt;
    &lt;string-array name=""projectoA""&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Projecto #1&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Projecto #2&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Projecto #3&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Projecto #4&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Projecto #5&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Projecto #6&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Projecto #7&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/string-array&gt;
    &lt;string-array name=""projectoB""&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Projecto #8&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Projecto #9&lt;/item&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>What I want is to wrap <strong>every</strong> scattered (I mean between paragraphs, tables, illustrations etc.) <strong>sequence</strong> of <code>li</code> elements with <code>ol</code> or <code>ul</code> element depending on some semantic and return wrapped XML.</p>

<ul>
<li>if first character in paragraph is equal to <code>-</code>, then it should be <code>ul</code> with <code>mark=""DASH""</code> attribute</li>
<li>if paragraphs starts with <code>1.</code>, <code>2.</code>, <code>3.</code> etc, then I want <code>ol</code> with <code>numeration=""ARABIC""</code></li>

<p>For example (it's just one sequence):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul mark=""DASH""&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; some text&lt;/p&gt;

<p>That input XML is more complicated than I described (nested sequences, inner sequences in table elements), but I am looking for some idea, especially how to <em>catch &amp; process</em> particular sequence with such semantic.</p>

<p>I want output XML with exactly same ordering, just with wrapped <code>li</code> elements. XSLT 2.0/EXSLT are available if needed.</p>

I create a protobuf.Builder and reuse it for creating all messages, setting this string field and invoking method build(). I have bytes as input, e.g. for each message I have byte[], which should be set to string-field. So the question is - how can I set byte[] to string field of the builder without new memory allocation? </p>

<p>As far as I understand, when use protobuf builder in java there are two ways to set string-field: </p>

<ol>
<li>set(String field)</li>
<li>set(ByteString field)</li>
</ol>

<p>The first one requires to make a new object String from byte[], and that's why new memory allocation.
The second one requires to use some method of ByteString, for example ByteString.copyFrom(byte[]), but this method (as all other similar methods of ByteString) does not use exists byte array, and creates new one instead. 
So, is there any workaround about it?</p>

The @media queries were in my main Site.css file so I moved them to a 'new' stylesheet for all browsers. If put them in an IE specific stylesheet and remove them from all other stylesheets then everything works as planned since i'm targeting IE10 with the JS that adds the ie10 class if the correct browser loads so i'm good. Problem is that i need those @media queries for things to work on all other browsers and since IE10 and above have stopped using conditional statements i cant exclude the 'new' stylesheet by using the <code>&lt;!--[if !IE]</code> comment. </p>

<p>If i use:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!--[if !IE]&gt;
&lt;link href=""@Url.Content(string.Format(""{0}/css/search-media-queries.css"", Model.RequestAuthorityUrl))"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" /&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to work on all IE but it doesn't load the stylesheet in the other browsers. The syntax for the location of the stylesheet is a little odd but theres a purpose to that and it has nothing to do with the issue so i dont want to clutter this question wit</p>

<p>Any advice on how i should go about adding these styles to all browsers EXCEPT ie and then i can have them in the IE specific stylesheet so they wont load right away and break my layout. I understand this probably sounds confusing and was a difficult bug to finally figure out because i also couldn't see my code in the IE inpsector to debug so i had to just take out CSS until i finally noticed what it was.</p>

<p>ORIGINAL ISSUE:
What was happening is that i have a div with some inputs and have made that div responsive and tweaked with @media queries. If i load the page the div and it's contents are displayed as if already using one of the @media queries although the browser size is outside of the scope of the @media queries. If I resize the browser (make it smaller) and then i set it back to fit the full size of my screen then the correct layout is applied.</p>

<p>UPDATE CSS CODE EXAMPLE:</p>

<pre><code>@media screen and (max-width: 1222px)

<p>I don't need many functions, and implementing the needed functions on compilers without support is not too difficult. But I have a hard time implementing the 'type' itself. Ideally, I would like to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef HAVE_CREAL
double creal(complex z)
{
/* .... */
}
#endif

#ifndef HAVE_CREALF
float creal(float complex z)
{
/* ... */
}
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>But I am not sure I see how to do this if the compiler cannot recognize 'float complex'. I would actually think it is impossible, but the C library by <a href=""http://www.dinkumware.com/c99.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Dinkumware</a> seems to indicate otherwise. What is the solution ? I don't mind using functions/macros for operations on the type, but I need a way to assign values to a complex number, and get back its real/imaginary part in a way whichi is compatible with C99.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>

<p>I ended up doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef USE_C99_COMPLEX
#include &lt;complex.h&gt;
typedef complex my_complex;
#else
typedef struct {
  double x, y;
} my_complex;
#endif

/*
 * Those unions are used to convert a pointer of my_complex to native C99
 * complex or our own complex type indenpendently on whether C99 complex
 * support is available
 */
#ifdef USE_C99_COMPLEX
typedef union {
    my_complex my_z;
    complex c99_z;
} __complex_to_c99_cast;
#else
typedef union {
    my_complex my_z;
    my_complex c99_z;
} __complex_to_c99_cast;
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>for the type definition, and as follows to define a set of complex functions:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef HAVE_CREAL
double my_creal(my_complex z)
{
    union {
            my_complex z;
            double a[2];
    } z1;
    z1.z = z;
    return z1.a[0];
}
#endif

#ifdef HAVE_CREAL
my_complex my_creal(ny_complex z)
{
    __complex_to_c99_cast z1;
    __complex_to_c99_cast ret;

    z1.my_z = z;
    ret.c99_z = creal(z1.c99_z);
    return ret.npy_z;
}
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>That's a bit complicated, but this enables me to easily reuse C lib functions when available, and it can be partly automated through code generator.</p>

<p>Here is the HTML form (and the javascript for the JQuery post function):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;

    // fire off the request to /form.php
    request = $.ajax({
    url: 'postregister.php',
    type: ""POST"",
    data: serializedData,
    success: function(result){
        console.log(result);
    },
    error: function(){
        console.log('error');
    }   
});

    // callback handler that will be called on success

    $(""#navigation"").html(serializedData);
    });

    // callback handler that will be called on failure
    request.fail(function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown){
        // log the error to the console
        console.error(
            ""The following error occured: ""+
            textStatus, errorThrown
        );
    });

    // prevent default posting of form
    event.preventDefault();
});
}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;form id=""rchar"" method=""POST"" action=""postrenamecharacter.php""&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test Form!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table id=""leftalignment1""&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Name: &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=""text"" size=""35px"" id=""name"" value="""" placeholder=""Name"" name=""name""&gt;&lt;input type=""hidden"" value=""Test"" id=""hidden"" name=""hidden""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;input action=""submit"" value=""  Register  "" id=""submit"" type=""submit""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So the response will be posted in the Java terminal and the JQuery POST variables will be loaded into the navigation bar. The navigation bar has the correct variables by reading this:</p>

<p><code>""name=Jeremy&amp;hidden=Test&amp;password=thisisatest""</code></p>

<p>Here is the PHP function called ""postregister.php""</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$oldname = $mysqli-&gt;real_escape_string($_POST['hidden']);
$password = $mysqli-&gt;real_escape_string($_POST['password']);
$title = ""Your password is: "";
echo $title . ""&lt;br&gt;"" . $password . ""&lt;br&gt;Your old name was: &lt;br&gt;"" . $oldname;
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is that the PHP code only returns this:</p>

<pre><code>""Your password is: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your old name was: &lt;br&gt;""
</code></pre>

<p>So obviously, the PHP variables are not being passed on to the PHP POST form from JQuery. Any help guys? I would really, REALLY appreciate it!</p>

However, the modal works fine on the first page of the table, but when the table goes to the 2nd page, the modal stops working. My guess is when the table paginates to the next 10 entries, something happens that removes the dialog click call.</p>

<p>Here is my code for the modal:</p>

<pre><code>    $('#delete-dialog').dialog({
        autoOpen: false, 
        width: 400,
        modal: true
    });

    $('.delete_modal').click(function (e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        var targetUrl = $(this).attr(""href"");
        $('#delete-dialog').dialog({
          buttons: {
            ""Delete"": function() {
              window.location.href = targetUrl;
            },
            ""Cancel"": function() {
              $(this).dialog(""close"");
            }
          }
        });
        $('#delete-dialog').dialog(""open"");
    });
</code></pre>

<p>and here is my code for the modal:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""delete-dialog"" title=""Remove User""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you sure you want to delete this user?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea why it works on the first page of the table, but not the 2nd?</p>

<p>Here is my delete code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""?page=users&amp;sub=admins&amp;action=delete&amp;id=&lt;?=$row['id']?&gt;"" class=""delete_modal""&gt;&lt;span class=""icos-trash""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<p>which doesn't work (I have initialized audioPlayer properly,it can play sound but just can't be caught when its currentTime value changes)</p>

<p>I test these code with another property ""double testNumber"" , set it as the argument of ""keyPath"" , increase it by one when I touch the screen , then that works well.

<p>For some reason I am unable to TwoWay bind a value to a ComboBox if it is inside a ItemsControl. Outside works just fine.</p>

<p>I have an ObservableCollection of int? in my ViewModel:</p>

<pre><code>    private ObservableCollection&lt;int?&gt; _sorterExitsSettings = new ObservableCollection&lt;int?&gt;();
    public ObservableCollection&lt;int?&gt; SorterExitsSettings
    {
        get { return _sorterExitsSettings; }
        set
        {
            if (_sorterExitsSettings != value)
            {
                _sorterExitsSettings = value;
                RaisePropertyChanged(""SorterExitsSettings"");
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>My XAML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ItemsControl ItemsSource=""{Binding SorterExitsSettings}""&gt;
&lt;ItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
    &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;ComboBox ItemsSource=""{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType=ItemsControl}, Path=DataContext.ScanRouter.Stores}""
                        SelectedValue=""{Binding Path=., Mode=TwoWay, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}"" DisplayMemberPath=""name"" SelectedValuePath=""id"" IsEditable=""True"" /&gt;
    &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
&lt;/ItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>So the ComboBox is populated with a list of stores. It works fine so far.
The ObservableCollection SorterExitsSettings even has some values set which are shown in the displayed ComboBoxes. So setting the SelectedValue also works.</p>

<p>However when I change a selection, SorterExitsSettings wont change. While when I implement the ComboBoxes(100) without an ItemsControl it suddenly works fine.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ComboBox ItemsSource=""{Binding ScanRouter.Stores}"" DisplayMemberPath=""name"" SelectedValuePath=""id"" IsEditable=""True"" SelectedValue=""{Binding SorterExitsSettings[0], Mode=TwoWay, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Even better when I implement the ComboBoxes using the ItemsControl and also the example ComboBox shown above. When I change the single ComboBox's value it will change the value of the ComboBox inside the ItemsControl, but not the other way around.</p>

<p>Did somebody encounter this problem before?</p>

<p>My guess was that the ItemsControl doesn't like the fact that I am binding my selected value to an item in a list. However when I bind directly to a ViewModel property(Store) it also doesn't work.
I also tried using SelctedItem instead of SelectedValue and populate the ObservableCollection with Store objects instead of int?.</p>

<p>Interestingly, if I want to play a WAV file, for which I have to open it with <code>waveaudio</code> instead of <code>mpegvideo</code> (like this <code>cmd = ""Open test.mp3 type waveaudio alias WAVFile""</code> ), everything works fine.  But no matter what I tried it won't work if I try to open an MP3 file. </p>

<p>What am I missing?  I've seen a dozen unanswered questions like this going back to 2000 - there has to be a way to play an MP3 file on a different sound card.</p>

I.e.</p>

<p>3 pictures are displayed. The user can either use <code>PREV</code> or <code>NEXT</code> buttons to view the next/prev 3 images. They can also navigate through all the images with the slider.</p>

<p>The next step is to make this slider look like a timeline. The left hand side needs to start at 1970 and finish at 2010. For each item (an item is a set of 3 images in this case) I need it to show a date on the timeline.</p>

<p>i.e: <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/CG7u8.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I know I have to set the baseURL to this exact path but I can't seem to find the way to obtain the UIWebView Object somehow.</p>

<p>I have also noticed that in the native part:</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>yes I have noticed that method, but it is not working the way I want it to work. So let me explain what the case is: I have the .html files that I want to display in my project folder. The goal is to download css files in initialization phase of the app and then load the main web view with the reference in the folder of my previously downloaded css. I know it can be done with the ""file:"" protocol in the link of the css reference but unfortunately we don't know the exact path in order to include it in the html files. If I change the resource path to my downloaded folder then the application can't find the index.html.</p>

<p>So my question is that if anyone can in someway load the html files and make a ""reference"" in a downloaded css folder. An example code would be:</p>

<pre><code>in index.html:
&lt;link href=""/allCss.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The allCss file is located in a local folder in my application which is downloaded as I already stated. </p>

<p>My first guess was to ""add"" a resource path, but it doesn't work as expected. Any other suggestions of how to approach this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

On the production server (Ubuntu, Python 3.4, same versions of Django and BeautifulSoup - only difference is the use of gunicorn and Nginx) I get:</p>

<pre><code>'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 301: ordinal not in range(128)

<p>The trackback shows that the problem is in the statement ""BeautifulSoup(data)"". </p>

<pre><code>data = open(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'data/file.xml'))
data = BeautifulSoup(data)
</code></pre>

<p>It seems as if BeautifulSoup tries to use ascii but the files are utf-8 encoded. I tried different approaches I could find here at stack overflow, but most of them rely on Python 2 - but I use Python 3. I also tried something like that:</p>

<pre><code>data = BeautifulSoup(str(data.read()))

<p>But that doesn't work. </p>

<p>The context and the categories are not available in the onSuccess obviously.  I could make these global variables, but the issue would be that this is getting calle din a loop, so the onSuccess will be called a few times with no guarantee which one returns first.</p>

<p>I am pretty new to Java.  In Objetive-C, you stil have access to the variables outside of the anonymous function inside the code block.  If it can't be done, I will jsut have to customize my query to pull back all the data at once, and then parse it on the client-side, which is a better solution anyway, but I would like to know if accessing items inside the callback is possible.</p>

The problems with this are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each developer must set the dependency paths correctly on their machine, test machines and build machines etc. to be able to run the code correctly</li>
<li>We cannot set the paths for each developer centrally so when dependencies change, we must issue instructions for individuals to manually change their configuration</li>
<li>If different projects use incompatible dependencies then the path must be reconfigured between changing projects</li>
</ul>

<p>For C++\C#\Java etc. projects, it is possible to refer to libraries with relative paths from within the project and not require changes to global environment variables.</p>

<p>The issue occurs when I try to rotate the world with the touch screen and the CMMotionManager matrix.</p>

<p>I've tried adding the touch screen movement values to the yaw, pitch, roll returned by the CMMotionManager and creating a new modelViewMatrix. I'm close with this, but when I rotated with the touch 90 degrees along the X(roll), or Y(pitch) then spin the phone from landscape to portrait (90 degree yaw rotation) the matrix doesn't rotate properly, it starts rotating what I think is on the x and z axis.</p>

<p>I think the issue is how I calculated the _rotationX and _rotationY from the yaw. I think it needs to be from the yaw/pitch/roll of the current modelViewMatrix, I just cannot figure out this formula/how to calculate the _rotationX and _rotationY with the current modelViewMatrix state.</p>

This is relatively easy using the old IsolatedStorage method, but it's proving significantly harder using the new WinRT API. </p>

<p>I've been trying to write it, but there seem to be all these weird things like IBuffer. and such. Using the full version of WinRT, it's quite easy using Windows.Storage.FileIO which appears to exist to keep developers like me from going insane. However, it's not implemented in the Phone version. Also, I watched a <a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Building-Apps-for-Windows-Phone-8-Jump-Start/Building-Apps-for-Windows-Phone-8-Jump-Start-04-Files-and-Storage-on-Windows-Phone-8"" rel=""nofollow"">Channel9</a> video which showed some code samples, but they had a mistake in that they used methods marked Security Critical to get regular streams. Apparently getting a regular Stream just isn't allowed. </p>

<p>So, can someone provide me with a concise and correct snippet on how to just read a file into a string and how to write a string to a file, complete with proper using and disposal techniques? </p>

<p>I guess the error has to do with the rules created with an older version of checkstyle.</p>

<p>The checkstyle plugin configuration inside the pom.xml is:</p>

&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;

<p>Is there a way or tool to migrate the rules to make them checkstyle 5.5 compatible? (Other than overviewing rule per rule based on the checkstyle documentaion)</p>

The application authenticate users with MySQL behind MD5 encrypted password. Following this, the application need to upload and download many files trought ftp.</p>

<p>The fact is : any network sniffer (such as Ethereal also known as WireShark) can grab my plain user and password from the ftp part of my application. Encrypted password can also be grab and anyone can log with any ftp application to my server and make unpleaseant things.</p>

<p><strong>[TindyFTP]</strong> is used to manage the FTP connexion itself. This object those not support SFTP which I tought that could be the end of my problem.</p>

<p><strong>[tMyMac]</strong> from DEVART is used to manage MYSQL connexion.</p>

<p>What is my point by now : 
It is a good way to use SSH Tunneling to control the IO Handler of both (ftp and mysql) transaction type onto my application ? I'm doing some test right now with <a href=""http://www.devart.com/sbridge/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>SecureBridge</strong></a> from DEVART which is compatible with MyDAC component and TIndy. </p>

<p>Do I simply need to get connected to <strong>SSH Tunnel</strong> and go trought it with mysql and ftp ? 
Do I also need to encrypt ftp password while using SSH Tunnel ?
For the MySQL part, the password seem to be encrypted or obfuscated when I try to intercept it with WireShark.</p>

<p>Thanks to let me know your idea from that point without changing all the structure of my program which is 99% completed :)</p>

<p>I do one set of calls to format my left nav (changing a link to pageX to my wikiParse?page=pageX type of thing). I can safely do this on the left nav. In the body text, however, I cannot safely assume a link is a link to an internal page. It could very well be a link to an external resource. So I need to do a preg_replace that matches href= that is not followed by http://.</p>

<p>Here is my stab at it:</p>

<pre><code>$result = preg_replace('href\=\""(?!http\:\/\/)','href=""bla?id=',$result);

<p>This seems to strip out the entire contents on the page. Anyone see where I slipped up? I don't think I'm too far off, just can't see where to go next.</p>

The problem is sometimes the company may only have the title, address1, and town/state/zip yet other times it may be all but address2.  This is determined upon a db record request server side.  Therefore how can I make my output look proper when some of my labels will be blank?  <strong>I would like div's that contain an empty span to be essentially collapsed/removed.</strong>  My only idea of how was to use jquery and a selector to find all divs with blank spans (since thats all an asp.net label really is) and then remove those divs however this seems like such bad form.  Is there any way to do this with css?  Possible Code would be something like:  $('span:empty:only-child').parent('div').remove();  </p>

<p>To start with, we have</p>

<pre><code>Template.player.events({
    'click': function () { 
        Session.set(""selected_player"", this._id);
    }   
});
</code></pre>

<p>I find it a little bit confusing how <code>this</code> is associated with the player collection, but I imagine this has to do with the <code>&lt;template</code> part.  I am also able to do</p>

<pre><code>Template.leaderboard.events({
    'click input.delete': function () {
        Players.remove(this._id);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>...which does remove the player with the associated button entry.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now for the actual question part: I have added this to the bottom of the leaderboard template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    Add player: (Name &lt;input required name=""name"" id=""name""&gt;)
    (Score &lt;input required name=""score"" id=""score""&gt;)
    &lt;input class=""add"" type=""button"" value=""Add""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine, and I have <code>Template.leaderboard.events['click input.delete']</code> working fine, but in order to get the values I use:</p>

<pre><code>'click input.add': function () {
    var name = document.getElementById('name').value,
        score = document.getElementById('score').value;
</code></pre>

<p>It would make a lot of sense to me if I were able to use <code>this</code> in some way, or use the event to somehow get the values that correspond the inputs.  This not only makes sense to me from a design standpoint, but it would also cover the case of having more than one of these kinds of forms displaying simultaneously.</p>

<p>So in short is there any way to get elements that are near the target element in the context of an event?</p>

As you can see i am trying to make the 3 blocks align with the exception of the spike, which extrudes out. When I set this up in corona it basically makes the images align by height. </p>

I've been following <a href=""http://blog.garethdwyer.co.za/2013/07/getting-simple-flask-app-running-on.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>The only changes I've made from the development process (in which the app runs totally fine when I run it and then try to access it via localhost) are:</p>

<pre><code>1) Moved all the code in to /var/www
2) Changed it so that 
        if __name__=='__main__':
            app.run(debug = False) #Now False instead of True
3) Added a app.wsgi file
4) Added file my_app to /etc/apache2/sites-available
5) Ran these commands:
    $ sudo a2dissite default
    $ sudo a2ensite sitename.com
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the app.wsgi file:</p>

<pre><code>import sys 
sys.path.insert(0, '/var/www/my_app')

from app import app as application
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the my_app file in <code>/etc/apache2/sites-available</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:5000&gt;
         WSGIDaemonProcess app 
     WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/my_app/app.wsgi

     &lt;Directory /var/www/my_app&gt;

        Allow from 127.0.0.1
     &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see from the above file, I only want the flask app to be available on localhost. </p>

<p>When I run apache and try to access the website at <code>my_site.com:5000</code> I get an ""Unable to connect error"". I can't really figure out why. Any help would be appreciated. </p>

<p>Also, here is my directory structure for the Flask app itself if that's needed:</p>

<pre><code>/var/www/my_app/
    app/
        __init__.py
        static/
            css/
                bootstrap.css
            favicon.ico
            js/
                bootstrap.js
        templates/
            base.html
            index.html
            search.html
        views.py
    app.wsgi
    flask/           #my virtualenv
        #Your typical virutalenv structure
    flask_util_js.py   #File that is a FLask entension for client-side generation of URLs
    requirements.txt
    run.py
    virtualenv.py    #Creates virutalenv flask
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>So, I got the feeling that the way I had my code set up was being problematic. So I took everything in <code>run.py</code>, <code>__init__.py</code>, and <code>views.py</code> and made one big <code>main.py</code>. I've updated my <code>app.wsgi</code> to look like this:</p>

<p><strong>app.wsgi</strong></p>

<pre><code>import sys 

activate_this = '/home/achumbley/flask/bin/activate_this.py'
execfile(activate_this, dict(__file__=activate_this))

sys.path.insert(0, '/home/achumbley/new_flask_app')

from main import app as application
</code></pre>

<p>And now, my <code>/etc/apache2/sites-available/new_flask_app</code> looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *&gt;
  ServerName dev.east.appliedminds.com

  WSGIDaemonProcess app 
  WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/app.wsgi

 &lt;Directory /home/achumbley/new_flask_app&gt;
   WSGIProcessGroup main
   WSGIScriptReloading On
   WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
   Order deny,allow
   Allow from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, he is my newest directory structure:</p>

<pre><code>/home/my_username/new_flask_app/
    logging.log
    flask_util_js.py
    main.py
    static/
    templates/
</code></pre>

<p>It still does not work. But, it's possible I don't understand how to run the whole thing. I should have to run a <code>python main.py</code> right? It should just be automatic, at least that is what I assumed. </p>

<p>What I would like to know is the best way to do this. I am aware of how Phonegap works and have used it with PHP. Now I am trying to figure out how to do it using Java.</p>

<p>With PHP I would handle all of my server side stuff using jQuery / Ajax to interact with my PHP script.</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
  url: ""serverstuff.php"",
  context: document.body
}).done(function() {
  // do something
});

<p>For Java I am assuming I would need to make a web application and call in the .JSP file, maybe something similar. </p>

      context: document.body
    }).done(function() {
      // do something
    });
</code></pre>

<p>So I guess what I am asking is if this is a bad assumption? Or is there a better/ more practical way to do this? Also if I use JSP solely for server side I don't need HTML. So maybe a Servlet is what I would be looking for. Any guidance, advice, past experience would be very helpful. Thanks</p>

Reading I have found that:</p>

  <p>On BSD systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, the hardware double-precision rounding mode is the default, giving the greatest compatibility with native double precision platforms. On x86 GNU/Linux systems the default mode is extended precision (with the aim of providing increased accuracy).</p>

<p>On the same page <a href=""http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/gccintro/gccintro_70.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GCC INTRO</a> was explained how to enable double precision rounding on a Linux system but not how to use extended precision on other systems.
Is that possible on MacOs or Windows ? and how ?</p>

Bitbucket requires Applications to use OAuth2, and for that I found that <a href=""https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OLTU/Index"" rel=""nofollow"">Oltu</a> should do the job.</p>

<p>However, my knowledge of OAuth is very limited and so I am stuck at a very early point. Here is what I did so far:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> I registered an OAuth Consumer with my Bitbucket Account with the following details:</p>

<pre><code>Name: jerseytestapp
Description:
CallbackURL: http://localhost:8080/
URL: 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Could I automate this step?</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> I ran the following Java code:</p>

<pre><code>package jerseytest;

import org.apache.oltu.oauth2.client.request.OAuthClientRequest;
import org.apache.oltu.oauth2.common.exception.OAuthSystemException;

public class BitbucketJersey {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    OAuthClientRequest request;
    try {
        request = OAuthClientRequest
                .authorizationLocation(""https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize"")
                .setClientId(""jerseytestapp"")
                .setRedirectURI(""http://localhost:8080"")
                .buildQueryMessage();

            System.out.println(request.getLocationUri());

        } catch (OAuthSystemException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> I received the following locationURI and opened in Firefox</p>

<pre><code>https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080&amp;client_id=jerseytestapp
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Do I need to use the browser or can I do this from the java application?</p>

<p>I receive the following answer message in Firefox:</p>

<pre><code>Invalid client_id
This integration is misconfigured. Contact the vendor for assistance.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> What would be the correct next steps, and what is wrong with my approach?</p>

<p>If i write some HTML in the ""eksamen_save_data.php"" i can show this, but it wont run the PHP. I'm using XAMPP.
The problem is that it wont save to the ""data.txt"" file as i tell the PHP to do.</p>

<p>Another question; is there also a way, I can make the PHP run in the same file as where I have my fieldset?</p>

<p>LAST EDIT:</p>

<p>Most of the time it's the little mistakes that proves to be the biggest problem. For me i personally forgot to use: localhost/eksamen_tilføj.php in the browser.</p>

<p>So it was me making a mistake in XAMPP.</p>

<p>e.g PersonA dated PersonB, PersonB dated PersonC </p>

<p>and was wondering what the best way of persisting this data is to allow fast retrieval of all dates for a given person in Django, as by default to retrieve all PersonB's dates in the example above i would need an OR query where dater1 = PersonB or dater2 = PersonB? </p>

<p>One idea i had was to store the events both ways round so in the example above i would have </p>

<p>PersonA dated PersonB
PersonB dated PersonA
PersonB dated PersonC
PersonC dated PersonB</p>

<p>That way i can index the dater1 column and retrieve all PersonBs dates quickly. </p>

<p>My questions are. </p>

<p>a) is there a better way to do this than store all events twice</p>

<p>b) if not, how would i go about modifying the ORM to store the event both ways round. </p>

<p>I will also be using Tastypie or similar to provide an api.</p>

<p>Here is what I have done thus far. I went to <a href=""http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.2/</a> and downloaded ""(Mac OS X 64-bit/32-bit Installer (3.3.2) for Mac OS X 10.6 and later 2.)"".</p>

<p>Upon completion of the download, I ran:</p>

<pre><code>gem install libv8 --version 3.11.8.17

<p>Yet, I still received the same error. I noticed the output still said:</p>

<pre><code>""Using Python 2.5.4""

<p>Despite downloading a newer Python version, it is not being used. So how do I change the version of Python that the ""gem"" command uses? I searched and discovered ""virtualenv,"" which appears to be a good Python manager, however I am a bit at a dead end now. Any help or suggestion?</p>

The goal is to present English, Pinyin, or Hanzi and to then force the user to enter the 2 which are not shown. After working through a few simple Array errors, I encountered a NullPointerException.</p>

<p>Now, I understand what it is, I simply can't see why it is occurring.</p>

<p>In the file called Master.java, I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>static final String [] [] Mandarray = {{""You"", ""Nǐ"", ""你""}, {""Good"", ""Hǎo"", ""好""}};
</code></pre>

<p>In the constructor of my Chinese_Mandarin object, I copy the contents of this array to a new one, one of the members of the Chinese_Mandarin object, like so,</p>

<pre><code>    public Chinese_Mandarin(char transfer){ 
    if(transfer == 'n' || transfer != 'y')System.exit(0);

    for (int i = (Master.Mandarray.length-1); i&gt;0 ;i--){
        mandalist [i][0] = Master.Mandarray[i][0];
        mandalist [i][1] = Master.Mandarray[i][1];
        mandalist [i][2] = Master.Mandarray[i][2];
    }
</code></pre>

<p>With the above 'if' part of the system that asks if the user wishes to continue, it is not important.
Next, I check to make sure that the same entry isn't to be shown again by seeing if the first character is *, which, by my program, indicates the entry has already been used.</p>

<pre><code>public void presenter(){
    Scanner chinEngl = new Scanner(System.in);
    restart: for (int i = mandalist.length; i&gt;0 ;i--){
        randInt = random.nextInt(mandalist.length);
        randIntSub = random.nextInt(3);
        if(mandalist[randInt][randIntSub] == """"){
            continue restart;
        }
        else if (((mandalist[randInt][randIntSub]).charAt(0)) == '*'){
            continue restart;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Here, I initialize a scanner to be used later, create two random integers to be used later on, and make sure the elements aren't empty (for if they are, I pass to the tag 'restart' to continue looping despite this).</p>

<p>On the line:</p>

<pre><code>else if (((mandalist[randInt][randIntSub]).charAt(0)) == '*'){
</code></pre>

<p>I receive a NullPointerException error, but cannot fathom why... The Master.mandarray has been transferred to mandalist, I can assume (but that's why I am here) and as such there should be no trouble retrieving the first char of a full entry, right?</p>

<p>Is the problem that the system may retrieve a Chinese character and not know how to handle it?
Or is something that I am missing afoot?
Thank you to anyone who may help me. You will surely get credits!</p>

Like for zoom in, it should come with preconfigured transform values that are easily identifiable by human eye. Something like pop-animation and so on.</p>

<p>I assume these must be fairly well supported in iOS, either by a library or direct API support... But I'm not sure where to even start. </p>

At the moment I'm just trying to get an understanding of how they work. I've used this example code which creates a Bar Chart:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {

    $(function () {

    var data = [[0, 5],[1, 10],[2, 15],[3, 20],[4, 25],[5, 30]];
    var dataset = [{ label: ""2012 Average Temperature"", data: data, color: ""#5482FF"" }];
    var ticks = [[0, ""London""], [1, ""New York""], [2, ""New Delhi""], [3, ""Taipei""],[4, ""Beijing""], [5, ""Sydney""]];

    var options = {
        series: {
            bars: {
                show: true
            }
        },
        bars: {
            align: ""center"",
            barWidth: 0.5
        },
        xaxis: {
            axisLabel: ""World Cities"",
            axisLabelUseCanvas: true,
            axisLabelFontSizePixels: 12,
            axisLabelFontFamily: 'Verdana, Arial',
            axisLabelPadding: 10,
            ticks: ticks
        },

        legend: {
            noColumns: 0,
            labelBoxBorderColor: ""#000000"",
            position: ""nw""
        },
        grid: {
            hoverable: true,
            borderWidth: 2,
            backgroundColor: { colors: [""#ffffff"", ""#EDF5FF""] }
        }
    };

        $.plot($(""#placeholder""), dataset, options);
    });

});
</code></pre>

<p>If I were to use JQuery Flot Charts, I'd need to be able to pull the data in dynamically via AJAX as opposed to being hard coded into my Razor View like above. </p>

<p>I created an Action in my Controller which returns the same data as that hard coded into the example above</p>

<pre><code>[HttpGet]
public ActionResult GetTestData()
{
     return Json(new[] { new[] { 0, 5 }, new[] { 1, 10 }, new[] { 2, 15 }, new[] { 3, 20 }, new[] { 4, 25 }, new[] { 5, 30 }, new[] { 6, 35 } },JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I then amended the code in my Razor View by commenting out the data and plot calls and replaced them with an Ajax Request</p>

<pre><code>//var data = [[0, 11],[1, 15],[2, 25],[3, 24],[4, 13],[5, 18]];
//$.plot($(""#placeholder""), dataset, options);
$.ajax({
            type: ""GET"",
            url: '@Url.Action(""GetTestData"")',
            error: function () {
                alert(""An error occurred."");
            },
            success: function (data) {
                $.plot($(""#placeholder""), dataset, options);
            }
        });
</code></pre>

<p>This Ajax Request should then call the GetTestData Action in my Controller and return the Json data. However, I've put a break point on my GetTestData Action, debugged, and the Action never gets called, therefore the data is never returned in order to create the Bar Chart.</p>

<p>Could anyone please help me find out why my Action isn't called by my Ajax code.</p>

<p>Thanks for any feedback.</p>

<p>The debugger launches a node process and it stops on an exception (""angular is not defined""). It fails finding the <code>index.ts</code> file, though (""Error opening 'index.ts' (File not found)""). Hitting <code>Create file</code> in the error message creates a file at the root of the project, so I guess it looks for it there, where it obviously doesn't exist. I thought the <code>cwd</code> configuration option would allow me to specify a root directory for the typescript sources, but it doesn't seem to make any difference.</p>

<p>If I symlink the <code>src/app/index.ts</code> to the project's root, the debugger successfully opens it and shows me the breakpoint/exception point. The node process, however, won't go past the first instruction calling <code>angular</code>: </p>

<pre><code>var App = angular.module('MyApp', ['ngSanitize', 'ui.router']);
</code></pre>

<p>At the top of the <code>index.ts</code> file I have the usual references, including </p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;reference path=""../../.tmp/typings/tsd.d.ts"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But they seem to be ignored by node. So, to summarize:</p>

<ol>
<li>VSC's debugger seems to look for .ts files at the wrong place, at least with my configuration</li>
<li>the node process doesn't honor references</li>
</ol>

<p>Any idea how I can solve these problems? Lunching the app with the generated <code>gulp serve</code> task works fine and I can set breakpoints in safari/chrome and step into the typescript code (so code maps are fine). I would really like to use VSC's embedded debugger, though.</p>

My graphic card is a NVidia GeForce GT 425M. I made my experiments on a Ubuntu 12.04 with the NVidia driver 295.40.</p>

<p>I Create a QMainWindow containing two QGraphicsView, each graphics view are displaying the same scene. On One of the Graphics View, I setup an OpenGL View port.
The OpenGL View Port is a QGLWidget I had overloaded with the loading of the vertex and fragment shader programs.</p>

<p>Look at my QMainWindow constructor : </p>

<pre><code>MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget *parent) :
    QMainWindow(parent),
    ui(new Ui::MainWindow)
{
    ui-&gt;setupUi(this);
    m_scene = new QGraphicsScene(this);
    ui-&gt;gvShaded-&gt;setScene(m_scene);
    ui-&gt;gvUnshaded-&gt;setScene(m_scene);
    m_glWidget = new QGLScene();
    ui-&gt;gvShaded-&gt;setViewport(m_glWidget);
    m_glWidget-&gt;updateGL();
    if(m_glWidget-&gt;context()-&gt;isValid())
    {
        qDebug()&lt;&lt;""GL Context is valid"";
    }else
    {

    }

    qDebug() &lt;&lt; ""Opengl Version : "" &lt;&lt; m_glWidget-&gt;context()-&gt;format().openGLVersionFlags();

    QBrush brush(QLinearGradient(0,0,20,0));
    brush.setColor(Qt::blue);
    QGraphicsRectItem* rect = m_scene-&gt;addRect(0,0,20,20,QPen(Qt::black), brush);

    ui-&gt;gvShaded-&gt;ensureVisible(rect);
    ui-&gt;gvUnshaded-&gt;ensureVisible(rect);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I instantiate the object QGLScene which is : </p>

<pre><code>class QGLScene : public QGLWidget
{
public:
    QGLScene(QWidget* _parent=0);
protected :
    virtual void initializeGL();
};
</code></pre>

<p>My GLWidget Construction is : </p>

<pre><code>QGLScene::QGLScene(QWidget *_parent)
    :QGLWidget(QGLFormat(QGL::DepthBuffer), _parent)
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>And definition of initializeGL is : </p>

<pre><code>void QGLScene::initializeGL()
{
    qDebug() &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__;
    QGLShader fragmentShader(QGLShader::Fragment, context(), this);
    QGLShader vertexShader(QGLShader::Vertex, context(), this);
    QGLShaderProgram pgm(context(), this);
    if(vertexShader.compileSourceFile(""./vertexShader.glsl""))
    {
        if(fragmentShader.compileSourceFile(""./fragmentShader.glsl""))
        {
            pgm.addShader(&amp;fragmentShader);
            pgm.addShader(&amp;vertexShader);
            pgm.link();
            pgm.bind();
            qDebug() &lt;&lt; ""Shader bien chargé : ""&lt;&lt; pgm.log();
        }else
        {
            qDebug() &lt;&lt; ""Problem when loading fragment shader :"";
            qDebug() &lt;&lt; fragmentShader.log();
            qDebug() &lt;&lt; QString(fragmentShader.sourceCode());
        }

        qDebug() &lt;&lt; vertexShader.log();
        qDebug() &lt;&lt; QString(vertexShader.sourceCode());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My shaders are very useless shaders : 
Vertex :</p>

<pre><code> #version 150

uniform mat4 viewMatrix, projMatrix;

in vec4 position;
in vec3 color;

out vec3 Color;

void main()
{
    Color = color;
    gl_Position = projMatrix * viewMatrix * position ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Fragment : </p>

<pre><code>#version 150

in vec3 Color;
out vec4 outputF;

void main()
{
    outputF = vec4(1.0, 0, 0, 1.);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I attempt to have my Shaded Graphics view as a big red square because I think I enforced the pixels to be red (in my fragment shader).</p>

<p>I have no shader compilation error, but my two scene are the same.
Of course, the program pass into the initializeGL function (I can read the <strong>PRETTY_FUNCTION</strong>).</p>

<p>Does some one have an explanation ?</p>

<p>An additional limitation to this transaction system is that it can not ship more than 4 products together.  If the customer places an order for 5 products, 4 products are shipped together (and charged 1 shipping charge), the remaining product is shipped separately and charged another shipping charge (yes, the overall business wants to rebuild this entire legacy system....).  </p>

<p>What I am trying to determine is the number of products shipped per order, and the aggregate product costs and shipping costs.  </p>

<p>If you look at the last 4 characters of the MultOrderID, you'll see that it's sequential, YY6Y becomes YY6Z, then rolls over to YY71, YY72.  The logic is standardized - I know that if the CustomerID, SalesDate and SalesTime are the same, then I can pair off the products together.  What I don't know is HOW I can accomplish this.  </p>

<p>I believe the way to accomplish this is to break out the orders by CustomerID, SalesDate and SalesTime.  Then, I get a <code>for-loop</code>, or something like that to cycle through the individual entries.  Then, I look for the last 4 characters of the MultOrderID and say - If 1,2 and 3 are the same, and the 4th character is after the 4th character of the previous order, then pair it together, up to 4 orders.  If the orderID is the 5th to 8th order in the range, then that's shipment 2, etc.  </p>

<p>Can this be done in <code>SQL Server</code>?  If not in that, what should I write this in?  And is a <code>for-loop</code> what I should be using in this case?  </p>

<p>Edit:  Here is the output I am trying to get to.  Keep in mind that after the 4th product was shipped, I need to restart the ordering (so, 6 products get broken into 2 shipments [4 products and 2 products], 9 products into 3 shipments [4, 4, and 1].</p>

<p>My current problem is that I don't think that I am actually taking the nouns and inputing them into the list that I have set up within the python code.</p>

<p>Here's the code(Might make more sense than my english ;) ):</p>

<pre><code>def nounValue(noun):
    return noun.rsplit('(',1)[1]

with open(""nouns.txt"", ""r"")as file:
    nouns = file.read().splitlines()

for noun in nouns:
    print(noun)

orderList = [noun]
swapped = True
print(orderList)
while swapped == True:
    swapped = False
    for i in range(len(orderList)-1):
        if orderList[i] &gt; orderList[i+1]:
            temp = orderList[i]
            orderList[i] = orderList[i + 1]
            orderList[i + 1] = temp
            swapped = True

<p>I have a rather big code base, and isolating the problem is a difficult task. In my entry point class I instantiate the dependencies. One of these, is not created correctly, the object is there, but its constructor is not being called.</p>

<p>This only happens in ADVANCED mode, so I tried to pass --debug flag, and voila, the bug is gone, the constructor gets called. It's mind blowing. I can't copy paste any particular code, what would you suggest?</p>

The graph is wish to visualize is directed, and has an edge and vertex set size of 215,000 From the documenation (which is linked at the top page) it is clear that networkx supports plotting with <code>matplotlib</code> and GraphViz. In <code>matplotlib</code> and networkx the drawing is done as follows:</p>

<pre><code>import 
networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#Let g be a graph that I created
nx.draw(g)
</code></pre>

<p>I get a memory error after <code>nx.draw(g)</code>, afterwards you would normally do <code>plt.show()</code> or plt.[some_function] to save the file in a format for efficient and so forth.</p>

<p>Next I tried GraphViz. From the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz#Architecture"">wikipedia page</a> the <code>dot</code> format is used for directed graphs and I created a dot file:</p>

<pre><code>nx.write_dot(g, ""g.dot"")
</code></pre>

<p>This worked well and I had a dot file in my current directory that is 12 megabytes. Next I ran the <code>dot</code> program (part of graphviz to create a postscript file):</p>

<pre><code>dot -Tps g.dot -o g.ps
</code></pre>

<p>This slows down my computer, runs for a few minutes and then display <code>Killed</code> in the terminal. So it never could execute... While reading the documentation for graphviz it seems that only undirected graphs were supported for large graph visualization. </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:
With these two unsuccessful attempts can anyone show me how to visualize my large graph using python and networkx with about 215,000 vertices and 215,000 edges? I suspect as with Graphviz I will have to output into an intermediate format (although this shouldn't be that hard it won't be as easy as a builtin function) and then use another tool to read the intermediate format and then output a visualization.</p>

<p>So, I am looking for the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Output graph from networkx into an intermediate format</li>
<li>With new package/software/tool (ideally python-interactive) read intermediate format and visualize the large graph</li>
</ol>

<p>If you need more information let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Problem description:</strong></p>

<pre><code>static
{
    System.loadLibrary(""stlport_shared""); // C++ STL        
    System.loadLibrary(""lib2""); 
    System.loadLibrary(""lib3""); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Crashes the app in on of the <code>System.loadLibrary()</code> lines with a <code>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError</code>. 
<code>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Couldn't load stlport_shared from loader dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[dexPath=/data/app/app_id-2.apk,libraryPath=/data/app-lib/app_id-2]: findLibrary returned null</code></p>

<p><strong>Solution approach</strong></p>

<p>We started running some custom diagnostics on all our installs to check if every lib is unpacked in the <code>/data/data/app_id/lib</code> folder.</p>

<pre><code>PackageManager m = context.getPackageManager();
String s = context.getPackageName();
PackageInfo p;
p = m.getPackageInfo(s, 0);
s = p.applicationInfo.dataDir;

File appDir = new File(s);
long freeSpace = appDir.getFreeSpace();

File[] appDirList = appDir.listFiles();
int numberOfLibFiles = 0;
boolean subFilesLarger0 = true;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; appDirList.length; i++) {

    if(appDirList[i].getName().startsWith(""lib"")) {
        File[] subFile = appDirList[i].listFiles(FileFilters.FilterDirs);   
        numberOfLibFiles = subFile.length;
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; subFile.length; j++) {
            if(subFile[j].length() &lt;= 0) {
                subFilesLarger0 = false;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>On every test phone that we have <code>numberOfLibFiles == 3</code> and <code>subFilesLarger0 == true</code>. We wanted to test if all libs are unpacked properly and are larger then 0 byte. In addition we're looking at <code>freeSpace</code> to see how much disk space is available. <code>freeSpace</code> matches the amount of memory that you can find in Settings --> Applications at the bottom of the screen. The thinking behind this approach was that when there is not enough space on the disk available that the installer might have problems unpacking the APK.</p>

<p><strong>Real world scenario</strong></p>

<p>Looking at the diagnostics, some of the devices out there do <strong>NOT</strong> have all 3 libs in the <code>/data/data/app_id/lib</code> folder but have plenty of free space. I'm wondering why the error message is looking for <code>/data/app-lib/app_id-2</code>. All our phones store their libs in <code>/data/data/app_id/lib</code>. Also the <code>System.loadLibrary()</code> should use a consistent path across installation and loading the libs? How can I know where the OS is looking for the libs?</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Anyone experiencing problems with installing native libs? What work arounds have been successful? Any experience with just downloading native libs over the internet when they are not existent and storing them manually? What could cause the problem in the first place? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I now also have a user who runs into this problem after an application update. The previous version worked fine on his phone, an after an update the native libs seem missing. Copying the libs manually seem to cause trouble as well. He is on android 4.x with a non rooted phone without custom ROM.</p>

<p>I'd like to create a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">literate program</a>, hosted on github, and have the resulting human-friendly literature automatically published on my github's project page.  By ""automatically published,"" I mean that I can run a script on my local machine that ends with ""git push origin master,"" and ends up with a published human-friendly, math-containing document on github.  I'm open to compromises on the procedure to get there, but the simpler, the better.</p>

<p>Many people don't know what literate programming is, so I'll summarize that.  It's a system where you write a single document that can be translated into either source code or a human-friendly document.  The purpose is to very clearly explain the algorithm, in English (or other natural language), and it is considered useful when users may be as interested in reading about your algorithm as they are in using it directly.  Some folks (like Donald Knuth) consider literate programming as a critical tool in building any complex piece of software.</p>

<p>One idea to do this would be to generate something like a README.md file as the output of the literate program, but I don't know of any math support in github's markdown formatting.  It looks like github's wikis might support some math, but I don't know how to make the wiki be generated from the code -- as in, I'd like to be able to do a <code>git push origin master</code> from my machine, and have the github wiki automatically updated.</p>

<p>(Also, to understand why math support is important: I'm coming from a world of always using TeX or LaTeX to write papers, and I'm interested in a general system that other authors used to LaTeX could also use.)</p>

<p>I want to sign up a new user and after that set some data field on the user object. It is important for me to set the data field after the sign up, because later I want to enable automatic ACL setting using beforeSave triggers (currently no triggers are activated!).</p>

<p>What happens is the following: The sign up completes successfully and after that I set the data field and call <code>currentUser.save</code>. Sometimes the <code>SaveCallback</code> is not called at all (neither with an error, nor successfully). However, most of the times it is called but the Session for the user is deleted. I can easily check that in the Data Browser. Also, I get invalid session exceptions if I try to do anything after that.</p>

<p>Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>final User user = getData();
user.setEmail(emailStr);
user.setUsername(emailStr);
user.setPassword(password);

user.signUpInBackground(new SignUpCallback() {
    @Override
    public void done(ParseException e) {
        if (e == null) {
            // this will be more complex data in the future
            User.getCurrentUser().put(""testInt"", 5);
            User.getCurrentUser().saveInBackground(new SaveCallback() {
                @Override
                public void done(ParseException e) {
                    if (e == null) {
                        // Hooray! But wait.. Oh no, the session is gone
                    } else {
                        // Oh no, something even worse happened
                    }
                }
            });
        } else {
            // signup failed
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>After over one day of try&amp;error I'm starting to believe that this is actually a bug in the Parse framework. The <a href=""https://parse.com/docs/android/guide#users"" rel=""nofollow"">guide</a> explicitly states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New ParseUsers should always be created using the signUpInBackground (or signUp) method. Subsequent updates to a user can be done by calling save.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does anyone have similar behavior?</p>

<p>a. Is there any effective technique to check zero-row-result and assign ""-"" value to specific coloumn?

<p>The need is to store user scores in database, to be able retrive result tables for overall/year/mont/week/day time spans. That takes each year: {year score} + {month score}*12 + {week score}*52 + {day score}*360 = ~425 rows per user + 1 {overall score} row per user. That does not feel optimized, that is why I am here with this question.</p>

<p>What base to use? Mentioned above, is base for timespans, using structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>{timespan type} {timespan} {user ID} {score for type 1} {score for type 1} {score for type 1} {score for type 2}
</code></pre>

<p>Another thing that I need to note. There are different methods for different score types, to sort. If first type is plain score, where I take highest (more - better), then second type is speed, where I sort by fastest speed (smaller - better).</p>

<p>If you have question: ""Why seperate rows for weeks/months/years/overall?"", then answer is, that I want some fast way to get a results table, for example, for last weeks score type 2, first 3 places.</p>

<p>I was thinking, maybe, if I store only {day score}, getting rid of those 426-360=66 rows per user in current structure, leading to new structure:</p>

<pre><code>{user ID} {day number} {score for type 1} {score for type 1} {score for type 1} {score for type 2}
</code></pre>

<p>How will I get out ""First 3 places for best score in speed, for previous week"". That would take some multi-level calculations...</p>

<ol>
<li>Query for rows with days, that goes into time span for previous weeks for ALL users</li>
<li>Sum all scores for each {user ID} or get lowest score (depending on score type) and put in a new table</li>
<li>Query new table, sorting by score column ASC or DESC (depending on score type) and retreive first 3 rows</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2. &amp; 3. for each score column</li>
</ol>

<p>If I want to do that more than 1-3 times a minute (as after each new input in table, I need to evaluate, how much points for specific user is to get in higher standing, I imagine, that would take some serious server resources. As of structure given at top of question (timespan base), that only takes step 3. for each score column.</p>

<p>Thanks for answers &amp; suggestions!</p>

<p>The checkbox is</p>

<pre><code>//tr[5]/td[4]/input

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;//tr[contains(text(), 'McGowan')]/td[2]&lt;/td&gt;

<p>Even if the text matches identically, it gives me the locator not found error. No matter what combination i use to find xpath by text it has never worked, and ive spent quite a few hours reading every combination out there. </p>

<p>On submit the form I am calling javascript function save:</p>

<pre><code>$(function () {

    save = function () {

        // some logic

        $.ajax({
            url: ""/franchise/SaveFranchise"",
            type: ""POST"",
            data: { franchiseInfoViewModel: jsonData },               
            dataType: 'json',
            success: function (data, textStatus, xhr) {
                window.location.href = data.redirectToUrl;
            }
        });
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>On save I am submitting the data in json format and sending the data to the SaveFranchise Controller:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult SaveFranchise(string franchiseInfoViewModel)
        {
            var franchiseInfoVM = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;FranchiseInfoViewModel&gt;(franchiseInfoViewModel);

            if (!ModelState.IsValid)
            { 
                // do some action
            }

            return View();
        }
</code></pre>

<p>What I want to accomplish is on <code>(!ModelState.IsValid)</code> to return back to the view and show fluent validation error messages. For some reason, in my case ModelState.IsValid is always true.</p>

<p>As mentioned, I am very new to Asp Mvc 3. From the articles I have read, the examples are submitting the form to the server (without javascript) where there is binding and the server validation messages are returned to the view. But there the view is implemented with Razor and client side validation is done via jquery.</p>

<p>In my view I am using javascript view model with databindings ( kendoui + knockout). What should I do to do the server side validation in my case. Please help me. Thank You for your time and effort! </p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<pre><code>public class ContextChangeListener {
    public event EventHandler&lt;ContextChangeEvent&gt; ContextChanges;

    private ObjectContext _context;

    public ContextChangeListener(ObjectContext context) {

<ol>
<li>SavingChanges event occurs; add all the changed entries to a collection and wait for ""ChangesCommited"" event.</li>
<li>""ChangesCommited"" event occurs; send out ContextChangeEvent.</li>

<p>And the database schema for these tables look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Projects:
ProjectID
ProjectName

ProjectRevisions:
ProjectRevID    
ProjectID
ProjectRevName

Tasks:
TaskID
ProjectRevID
TaskName
HoursToComplete
</code></pre>

<p>The tasks table is populated from another table, TaskDescriptions, which contains the master list of tasks.</p>

<p>My employer also wants subquotes - meaning an individual can quote his own effort seperate from the master quote.  Each time a ProjectRevision takes place, the Subquotes must be redone, and all old Revisions and SubQuotes must be kept for future reference.  </p>

<p>How would this look in a table schema?  In my eyes, this is essentially a four-level list:  A project contains a list of Revisions, which each contain a list of SubQuotes, which each contain a list of tasks.  </p>

<p>I may be overthinking this, but any help is greatly appreciated</p>

I want a component on a form offer me some menu items in the context menu during design-time.

In the debugger, i can see that the text to search in contains the part to search for, but the function returns 0 anyway! And, if i execute this directly (instead of debugging the IDE using it in a project) it all works fine.</p>

(Sparrow). I updated the source tree on my main Mac Mini but not in my MacBook Pro. So, Xcode was searching an old directory due to that mistake.</p>

<p>This may be one of those weird Xcode bugs, so I'm looking for a little advice. I have Xcode 4.3.2 (latest as of this writing Apr 7 2012) installed on two Macs. I have a project saved in Dropbox so I can quickly get at it and work on it from either place. I've done this with several other projects and never experienced this issue.</p>

<p>One one computer, a Mac Mini, the project builds fine. On the other, a 2009 MacBook Pro, I get build errors. For one, even though I'm using -fno-objc-arc on a few of the source files, I am still getting ARC related errors. That is very puzzling to me. No issue when building on the Mac Mini. I'm also getting ""file not found"" errors pertaining to the .pch file.  The error log is pointing me to a strange path like</p>

<pre><code>/var/folders/9l/s_phv6yj0hv6q82_lrdcckb00000gn/C/com.apple.Xcode.501/SharedPrecompiledHeaders/...Prefix.pch' file not found

<p>Here's what I've tried so far</p>

<ul>
<li>Deleted Xcode and reinstalled from the MAS</li>
<li>Deleted the /var/folders directory called out in the logs</li>
<li>Removed the project build directory</li>
<li>Performed a Product -> Clean in Xcode</li>
<li>Restarted Xcode numerous times</li>
</ul>

<p>Still no dice.  Looks like unless I can nail down this issue, I'll be stuck working from one workstation for this project only.  All other projects work fine when doing this.</p>

<p>I want the pictures to shuffle in between the different thumbnails and adjust it's size to match the thumbnail it is in. </p>

<p>I currently have this script that shuffles the thumbnails around the page: (What I don't want) </p>

<pre><code>(function($){

    $.fn.shuffle = function() {

        var allElems = this.get(),
            getRandom = function(max) {
                return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);
            },
            shuffled = $.map(allElems, function(){
                var random = getRandom(allElems.length),
                    randEl = $(allElems[random]).clone(true)[0];
                allElems.splice(random, 1);
                return randEl;
           });

        this.each(function(i){
            $(this).replaceWith($(shuffled[i]));
        });

        return $(shuffled);

    };

})(jQuery);

$(function(){
$('ul#list li').shuffle();
})
</code></pre>

<p>The thumbnails markup looks like the following. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class=""thumbnails"" id=""list""&gt;

<p>What could I change on the script that shuffles the thumbnails that would make it just shuffle the images and make those images adjust to the thumbnail it is located in? I have tried so much to get this. I hope I am making the question clear enough on what I am wanting. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>-select every name in the database, 
-order by last name 
-loop one by one, find what the first character is, save it to an array, 
-loop to the second one, get the first character, see if it already exists in the array and if it does ignore it
-do this on and on until I'm left with an array of only unrepeated letters.</p>

<p>I need to save an CDTStore object in the user defaults, to later retrieve it. (initially the reason is: CDTStore object gets destroyed after the app goes to background after some time, therefore not allowing to save objects to db anymore).</p>

<p>The header of the class looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>...
@interface CDTStore : NSObject
...
</code></pre>

<p>I have read this link: 
<a href=""http://iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-development/16205-saving-class-nsuserdefaults.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-development/16205-saving-class-nsuserdefaults.html</a>
His code (smithdale87):</p>

<pre><code>- (void)encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder *)encoder
{
       //Encode properties, other class variables, etc
    [encoder encodeObject:self.question forKey:@""question""];
    [encoder encodeObject:self.categoryName forKey:@""category""];

        self.subCategoryName = [decoder decodeObjectForKey:@""subcategory""];
    }
    return self;
}

<p>but the problem is that in case of CDTStore things are much more complex. Is there an easier way to do it? Or, if not, how to do it using his method?</p>

<p>As you can see the status of being collapsed or not is dynamic. Clicking the xy button executes the handleClose actionListener which sets the ""verifiedBy"" field. Therefore this panel should be collapsed. Also the comandbutton updates the complete datagrid nothing happens. Reloading the page shows the panel collapsed. So i thought it would work, but after three seconds the primefaces poll updates the datagrid again and the panel is not collapsed anymore. So panels being updated by the poll ignore the collapse attribute?! Any idea?</p>

<p>This works very well in a non-optimization context, because utils.js is downloaded only once, no matter whether is from module1 or module2. However I need to optimize and package each module in a JS file.</p>

<p>In order to get this, I add a main.js file in each module, for example:</p>

<p>module1/main.js</p>

        { name: ""module2/main"" },

<p>The example in question deals with gathering all links within a table into an array -- that part is complete.  However, once the links are in the array, the only meaningful way that I can interact with them appears to be .text.  Using @driver.navigate.to Array[1] gives a URL format error in the browser, and link.href or .src are not valid options.</p>

<p>The Watir implementation gathered these links (pages added by users via CMS), stored them in an array and then visited each page one by one, submitting a lead form.  I believe I could get this to work using Selenium and revisiting the ""home"" page that contains all of the links between lead form submissions, but that could mean hundreds of extra page loads, cached or not.</p>

<p>The code so far:
'   @countries = Array.new  </p>

<pre><code>@browser.navigate.to ""http://www.testingdomain{$env}.com/global""  
@browser.find_elements(:xpath, ""//table[@class='global-list']//a"").each do |link|      
  @countries &lt;&lt; [link.text, link.href]  ## The original WATIR line that needs an update
end #links  

@countries.uniq! #DEBUG for false CMS content'

<p>I basically need to make a simple BMI calculator webpage.</p>

<p>The top of the webpage has BMI calculator and then below it has a button that is called calculate bmi and prompts users for height and weight. Then, it displays the result along with the user entered height and white. </p>

<p>The problem is when it displays the results it erases the BMI writing at the top. </p>

<p>Task was quite simple - select values from one table if there is no corresponding value in another table. Assuming we have tables like below:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE first  (foo numeric);
CREATE TABLE second (foo numeric);
</code></pre>

<p>we would like to get all the values from <code>first.foo</code> if there doesn’t occur in the <code>second.foo</code>. I've proposed to solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>using <code>LEFT JOIN</code></li>
</ul>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>SELECT first.foo
FROM first
LEFT JOIN  second 
ON first.foo = second.foo
WHERE second.foo IS NULL;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>combining subquery and <code>IN</code> operator:</li>
</ul>



<pre><code>SELECT first.foo 
FROM first
WHERE first.foo NOT IN (
  SELECT second.foo FROM second
);
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason the first wouldn't work (returned 0 rows) in the context of the OP and it has been bugging me since then. I've tried to reproduce that issue using different versions of PostgreSQL but no luck so far.</p>

<p>Is there any particular reason why the first solution would fail and the second worked as expected? Am I missing something obvious? </p>

<p><a href=""http://sqlfiddle.com/#!12/e8fdc/1"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> is sqlfiddle but it seems to work on any available platform. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Like @bma and @MostyMostacho pointed out in the comments it should be rather second one that returned no results (<a href=""http://sqlfiddle.com/#!12/aa812/1"" rel=""nofollow"">sqlfiddle</a>). </p>

<p>This is no problem for most browsers (particularly IE 8, Chrome, Firefox), as they add a vertical scroll bar to the HTML document. However, <strong>IE7 does NOT show these scroll bars</strong>, making it impossible to view the entire Silverlight control.</p>

<p>Code snippet of how I have it embedded:</p>

<pre><code>...
&lt;div id=""silverlightControlHost""&gt;
&lt;object data=""data:application/x-silverlight-2,"" type=""application/x-silverlight-2""
    height=""100%""
    width=""100%""&gt;
    &lt;param name=""source"" value=""MyApp.xap"" /&gt;
    &lt;param name=""onError"" value=""onSilverlightError"" /&gt;
    &lt;param name=""background"" value=""white"" /&gt;
    &lt;param name=""minRuntimeVersion"" value=""4.0.41108.0"" /&gt;
    &lt;param name=""autoUpgrade"" value=""true"" /&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>Only relevant CSS:</p>

<pre><code>#silverlightControlHost
{
   height: 100%;
   text-align: center;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried adding an 'overflow: auto' and margin/padding style properties (which shows a scroll bar but doesn't actually scroll at all?), setting static sizes on the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>, neither which work. Keep in mind, the height of this control varies even after page load time (the Silverlight control switches between RootVisuals of varying height).</p>

<p>Any guru on IE7 have an idea how to circumvent this issue? Thanks.</p>

<p>I am making use of PassportJS to help with the authentications and sessions.</p>

<p>I want to use redis to store the sessions after a user logs in so that if the application restarts, the logged in user does not lose his session.</p>

<p>This is my code (stripped to bare minimum for brevity):</p>

<pre><code>var RedisStore = require('connect-redis')(express);

app.configure('development', function () {
    var redisUrl = url.parse(process.env.REDISTOGO_URL),
        redisAuth = redisUrl.auth.split(':');

    app.set('redisPort', redisUrl.port);
    app.set('redisDb', redisAuth[0]);
    app.set('redisPass', redisAuth[1]);
});

app.configure(function () {
    app.use(express.session({
        secret: 'My secret key',

    //Passport configuration
    app.use(passport.initialize());
    app.use(passport.session());

});
</code></pre>

<p>I use <code>request.isAuthenticated()</code> on requests to verify if the user is logged in.</p>

<p>If the user logs in, based on console statements, I see that the login is a success. PassportJS correctly logs the user in. However, <code>request.isAuthenticated()</code> returns false.</p>

<p>If I remove the redis code and keep only the PassportJS code, then it works perfectly.
What more should I do to work with redis and PassortJS?</p>

<p>My query is there: The fact that it is a repository means that SPWeb must NOT be passed but rather taken from there - SPContext.Current.Web would have given that to be used within the repository. The fact SPWeb is taken as an input means that UI layer / Service layer have to pass SPWeb in to the method which somehow is not appealing for me as that looks like violating repository persistence ignorance principles.</p>

<p>Some advice pls</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>When I look at the sprint burndown report, then I get a nice report. When I look at the release burndown then nothing.</p>

<p>This is the result of the test:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/3f8TT.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The CLEAR mode is the top left, which shows as black.</p>

<p>In another example where I was trying to use this I had a DialogFragment where CLEAR mode erased the entire DialogFragment so that the activity beneath could be seen. Hence the reason I used many different background colours in this test.</p>

<p>Could this possibly be clearing the pixels of the entire activity like that other example led me to believe? I would've thought only the pixels of canvas related to the view could be erased, but in my other example the pixels of the custom view, underlying image view and DialogFragment background were all cleared.</p>

<p>Could someone please help me understand what exactly is going on and why I am going so terribly wrong?</p>

<p>Thanks. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
I have reproduced an example that confirms my suspicions. When adding this exact custom view, but in a DialogFragment, the underlying activity becomes visible.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mLLgM.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This seems a pretty clear indicator to me that the <code>Mode.CLEAR</code> is somehow erasing the canvas of the views underneath as well? My guess would be the black in the first example is that of the top level view? </p>

<p>I am thinking I am doing something very wrong somewhere :S</p>

<p>I'd like to append some HTML and a JS function to the bottom of this code that I collect. The JS function and HTML is on my server in a file called append.txt. The problem is that the wepage I'm parsing from contains several redirections, so the code I append does not end up at the final redirected web page. This is basically what I'm doing:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$append = file_get_contents('myserverdirectory/append.txt');

echo $html . $append; //Append code to the parsed code and display it

<p>I've tested this on pages that don't get redirected and it is perfect. How can I append the code to the FINAL redirected page? Obviously the current code just appends it to the first page and after all the redirections my appended code is gone on subsequent pages. I can't just parse/scrape the final redirected page by the way...I wish it was that simple haha. I've tried using cURL for the redirects but it seems to do exactly the same thing...any ideas? It would be great if I could append my code to the webpage code after the redirects finish or something...I guess the major issue is that the echo and redirection in the echo'd code is causing it to exit the PHP.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>EDIT: As I said, I've tried using cURL to follow the redirects. This is useless and so is just using file_get_contents on the final web page. For some reason it needs all those redirects. I used this for the cURL implementation:</p>

<pre><code>function file_get_contents_curl($url) {
    $ch = curl_init();

    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); 
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);

    $data = curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);

    return $data;

$html = file_get_contents_curl('www.example.com/blahblah'); // This url is the first page before it does all the re-directing

This is, I think, also the most important part to be highly optimized. As movement happens all the time and costs a lot of bandwidth.</p>

<p>This is how my current system works:</p>

<ul>
<li>All movement is calculated by the client</li>
<li>When a client changes turning mode (turning left, not turning or turning right) this is being send to the server. The server then sends this new mode to all players that are near.</li>
<li>Same thing happens for movement mode (moving forward or not moving, there is no moving backwards).</li>
<li>Because of something (I think it's lag or delays between the client changes a mode and that new package actually being received by the clients that are near) the position of the other clients are not 100% accurate. So, every few seconds (I currently set it to 2) each client sends his current real position to the server, after which the server informs the near clients with the accurate position. Positions are checked with time-based range checks to avoid cheating.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the problem is, that this ""correction"" (step 4) is actually so big that you see the other clients ""warping"" to the real location every 2 seconds. So, I have 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is my ""algorithm"" efficient, smart and good? Or do you suggest (minor or mayor) changes, or a completely different way of doing this?</li>
<li>How should I solve the problem where the correction is actually too big so that the near clients are warping to their corrected location every 2 seconds?</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>var bounds = new GLatLngBounds();

for (var n = 0; n &lt; points.length; n++) {
  bounds.extend(points[n].getLatLng());
}

zoomLevel = map.getBoundsZoomLevel(bounds);
</code></pre>

<p>to get the zoom level, you have to pass in a bounds object. To create a bounds object, you either give it two points like a rectangle, or you pass it a point and it increases in size (if necessary) to incorporate the point which is what I do above.</p>

<p>The problem is that the points appear right on the edge of the screen. I'd like to increase the size of the bounds by say, 10%. I can get the two points out of my bounds object using <code>bounds.getNorthEast();</code> and <code>bounds.getSouthWest();</code> but to increase them by 10% of the size of the bounds is proving tricky. I tried <code>toSpan()</code> on the bounds which gives you a LatLng containing the size of the bounds, and then did 10% of the Lat and Lng and added it to my coordinates. However, it did not seem to work. My code for this attempt was:</p>

<pre><code>var pointNorthEast = bounds.getNorthEast();
var pointSouthWest = bounds.getSouthWest();

var latAdjustment = ((pointNorthEast.lat() - pointSouthWest.lat()) * increasePercentage) / 2;
var lngAdjustment = ((pointNorthEast.lng() - pointSouthWest.lng()) * increasePercentage) / 2;


var newPointNorthEast = new GLatLng(pointNorthEast.lat() + latAdjustment, pointNorthEast.lng() + lngAdjustment);
var newPointSouthWest = new GLatLng(pointSouthWest.lat() - latAdjustment, pointSouthWest.lng() - lngAdjustment);


bounds = new GLatLngBounds();

bounds.extend(newPointNorthEast);
bounds.extend(newPointSouthWest);
</code></pre>

<p>By my reckoning, bounds should then be 10% bigger. I'm not certain it represents just a rectangle or stores any coordinate data or not so I didn't take chances by adding/subtracting half of the increase on each side to keep it centered.</p>

<p>However, trying various increasePercentage values such as 1.1 or 1.5 it does not seem to make a difference.</p>

<p>Therefore I've either cocked up my logic, my maths, or the fact that zoomLevel is not a smooth scale is hampering my attempts.</p>

<p>I think I might have to just do <code>zoomLevel -= 1</code> and have done with it, but I wanted to see if anyone had any ideas first.</p>

I'm working with a tumblr theme which uses a text option, which means the user can type whatever they want, and it'll display on the blog. The text options however do not work with javascript, so I can't use the text option for amount of columns and the text option for spacing between posts in my script that organizes the whole page. I know there is a way, but I don't know how to do this, to just create an invisible div with the boo lean text in it, and then use jQuery to get the text inside the div to use as a variable? I was thinking like .text(); or .html(); but I have no clue. Any codes or help would be greatly appreciated. I'm new at this jquery thing, so it'd mean a lot.</p>

<p>EDIT: If this is confusing for anyone, I basically need to use jQuery to get text inside an invisible element and use that text as a variable.</p>

<p><em>So basicly I need to create an ArrayList which contains all Lists here referenced, because those can be null (they are fetched out of the database from an closed sourced framework, and unfortunately its null if he doesn't find anything), I need to check everytime if the collection is not null to add them into this pool which looks just weird.</em></p>

<p>ok, about my question: i'm a pretty sophisticated JS coder and a pretty senior PHP dev. my old school dev. setup basically was: code everything online (via textwrangler and FTP upload) on on dev-(sub)domain. if it works clone (download and upload) it to another domain. works great for one person (or 2 to 3 person teams).</p>

<p>i wanted to leave PHP behind now for many years, non the less i come back to it for my quick and dirty web-apps projects (i.e.: miniqr.com). not because i like it, but because there is no install this, install that, set up this, config that, run that, run this overhead. (it's ugly and compared to other setups - ugly, but it just works (most of the time good enough)).</p>

<p>so what i'm searching for is the same thing but with ruby (framework sinatra - as a db i want to run couchdb) </p>

<p>So my question relates to two sections of the above example:</p>

<ol>
<li>Since I am dealing with a tridiagonal matrix for <code>[A]</code>, also called a banded matrix, is there a more efficient way to solve the system of equations instead of using <code>numpy.linalg.solve</code>?</li>
<li>Also, is there a better way to create the tridiagonal matrix instead of using a <code>for-loop</code>?</li>
</ol>

<p>The above example runs on Linux in about <code>0.08 seconds</code> according to the <code>time.clock()</code> function.</p>

<p>The <code>numpy.linalg.solve</code> function works fine, but I'm trying to find an approach that takes advantage of the tridiagonal form of <code>[A]</code> in hopes of speeding up the solution even further and then apply that approach to a more complicated example.</p>

<p>(<em>The screenshot is in Dutch; the top part represents processor usage, the bottom part memory usage.</em>) As you can see, it looks like a new thread is being spawned almost every time the garbage collector gets in the way (as can be seen in the dips of memory usage).</p>

<p>I have a couple variations of that as well but that is what I currently have.
It does not set onfocus for the input field. </p>

<p>Basically what I want is when the user clicks on the input field to type in text, I display my toolbar that I have attached to the keyboard for this specific element only. And when the user no longer has focus of the input field, hide the toolbar. I would think there would be a way since the WebView knows when to open up the keyboard and when to close it. Possibly a way to intercept this?</p>

Stepy integrates with the jQuery Validation plugin.</p>

<p>I am running into an issue where if there are multiple radio buttons on the form, it throws and error and does not let the user continue.  This only happens after the first radio button (the first radio button validates fine) and only when there are steps after the radio button (if the radio button is on the last step it works fine).  </p>

<p>FireBug is displaying ""a is undefined"".  Also, this only seems to happen when the Validation plugin is activated (""validate: true"").  </p>

<p>Looking through the Stepy and jQuery Validate code, I can't seem to figure out why this is happening.</p>

<p>I have a working example posted: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/5Rd7A/3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/5Rd7A/3/</a></p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {

    $('#custom').stepy({
      backLabel: 'Backward',
      block: true,
      errorImage: true,
      nextLabel: 'Forward',
      titleClick: true,
      validate: true
    });

});

I created my repository in the root of drive c:. and my web project located at this path c:\wamp\www\my_webapp. should I put the 3 folders (branches,tags,trunk) and inside the trunk I have folder ""inventory"" and I will put all my php files js etc...? or should I creat another folder in other location like c:\  and put inside those 3 folders.then I will just copy the modified files into trunk then make <code>svncommit</code>.</p>

<p>This is the scenario that I am having.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong> I create repository using tortoise in c:\myrepo, then I generate also the 3 folders(branches,trunks,tags).</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong> I create new folder ""mywebsitesvn"" in c:\mywebsitesvn. after that I import my mywebsite folder which located in c:\wamp\www\mywebsite to c:\mywebsitesv now I make some first commit by adding mywebsite in mywebsitesvn.</p>

<p>Now when I made some changes in my code or update some js files from this location c:\wamp\www\mywebsite example I am updating my index.html,after I update the index.html I copied it to my mywebsitesvn then make some commit.</p>

<p>I have a jQuery reference of the innermost element: <code>$('#IAmTheTarget')</code>.</p>

<p>How can I (at best, without creating a performance nightmare :)) find out if my target is in a fixed positioned container? For example, <code>$('.MaybeIAmFixed')</code> could have a fixed position, but so could also any other parent of my target.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
I need to know this because when the element is fixed, I need to get its position with <code>$('#IAmTheTarget').position();</code> and if not, I need to get it with <code>$('#IAmTheTarget').offset();</code></p>

<p>Though I've got a lot more data. What I am trying to do is have the first column (350, 349, etc.) be defined as my x-values, and the second column (-0.042447984, -0.041671798, etc.) be defined as my y-values. This is my code so far:</p>

<pre><code>import pylab
x=[350, 349, 348, 347, 346]
y=[-0.042447984, -0.041671798, -0.04158416, -0.041811798, -0.041716855]
pylab.plot(x, y)
pylab.show()
</code></pre>

<p>However, instead of manually entering the numbers I'm trying to write a program that will extract column 1 from my CSV file as the x-values and column 2 as the y-values. It's probably something much simpler than I'm trying to make it. I'm new at python, so bare with me!</p>

<p>I have no problem to deal with standard messages from Nexmo API and I want to receive long SMS just like I do with standard ones (i.e. in one block). </p>

<p>Exemple of data received from Nexmo for a standard SMS:</p>

<pre><code>    $_GET['msisdn'] ==&gt; ""33612345678"" // ""from""
    $_GET['to'] ==&gt; ""33687654321""
    $_GET['messageId'] ==&gt; ""02000000478EBE09""
    $_GET['text'] ==&gt; ""Hello world!""
    $_GET['type'] ==&gt; ""unicode""
    $_GET['keyword'] ==&gt; ""HELLO""
    $_GET['message-timestamp'] ==&gt; ""2014-11-25 14:06:58""
</code></pre>

<p>Long one: (Nexmo sent it piece by piece)</p>

<pre><code>    $_GET['msisdn'] ==&gt; ""33612345678"" // ""from""
    $_GET['to'] ==&gt; ""33687654321""
    $_GET['messageId'] ==&gt; ""02000000478EBE09""
    $_GET['text'] ==&gt; ""the first part of a too long text...""
    $_GET['type'] ==&gt; ""unicode""
    $_GET['keyword'] ==&gt; ""THE""
    $_GET['message-timestamp'] ==&gt; ""2014-11-25 12:06:58""
    $_GET['concat'] ==&gt; ""true""
    $_GET['concat-ref'] ==&gt; ""108"" // unique identifier for long SMS text
    $_GET['concat-total'] ==&gt; ""4"" // or more, or less...
    $_GET['concat-part'] ==&gt; ""1"" // index of the part, start at 1
</code></pre>

<p>See more on the Nexmo documetation: <a href=""https://docs.nexmo.com/index.php/sms-api/handle-inbound-message"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a></p>

<p>So, I started from a library found on github (<a href=""https://github.com/prawnsalad/Nexmo-PHP-lib"" rel=""nofollow"">Nexmo-PHP-lib</a>) and did this:
(pretty ugly but it's for test purpose)</p>

<pre><code>public function inboundText( $data=null ){
    if(!$data) $data = $_GET;

    if(!isset($data['text'], $data['msisdn'], $data['to'])) 
        return false;
    if(isset($data['concat']) &amp;&amp; $data['concat'])
    {
        session_start();
        if ($data['concat-part'] &gt; 1) // first part ?
        {
            if ($data['concat-total'] == $data['concat-part']) // last part ?
            {
                // last part ! stock the data in the text and unset now useless $_SESSION entry!
                $data['text'] = $_SESSION[(string)$data['concat-ref']] . $data['text'];
                unset($_SESSION[(string)$data['concat-ref']]);
            }
            else // not the first or the last, so concat !
            {
                // concat the new part in the entry named after the concat-ref
                $_SESSION[(string)$data['concat-ref']] .= $data['text'];
                return false;
            }
        }
        else // first part ! so creat a $_SESSION entry for that! (named after concat-ref)
        {
            $_SESSION[(string)$data['concat-ref']] = $data['text'];
            return false;
        }
    }
    // Get the relevant data
    $this-&gt;to = $data['to'];
    $this-&gt;from = $data['msisdn'];
    $this-&gt;text = $data['text'];
    $this-&gt;network = (isset($data['network-code'])) ? $data['network-code'] : '';
    $this-&gt;message_id = $data['messageId'];

    // Flag that we have an inbound message
    $this-&gt;inbound_message = true;

    return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It works perfectly with local test but not when it's hosted on my heroku server, the $_SESSION array seems to be reset at each part of the sms...</p>

<p>So, have you any idea of how to handle it properly? (and without an ugly temporary SQL table).
How can I retreive the previous part of the message until I receive it completely?</p>

So now im trying to understand how to do that i i'll need your hints and your patience to help me... (if someday your make a trip in montreal, i'll pay you a coffee :))</p>

<p>So i'll explain my template structure... (see the screenshot---EDIT: new user, not allowed to post images)</p>

Left: Div ID=nav its all folder and sub-folder.<br>
A button Create library calling mkdir() JS function</p>

<p>|-IconShock     (X)   &lt;--to delete folder<br>
|---Vista collection (X)<br>
|-New folder 1 (X)  </p>

<p>At the right: Div ID=container...<br>
Contain icons like in windows explorer, showing icon image, onclick on an icon = show_info(url, height, width, size, etc..), update the bottom div id=show_info that show some information on the icon.</p>

<p>These products require a ""ProductID"" that ties them to whatever is in the appstore.</p>

<p>I will need to store these IDs somewhere in the application so I know what to send the server when the purchase button is clicked.</p>

<p>I wish to expose these ID's and allow non-programmers to enter any ID they want in both our side and the server side, and not have to call on a programmer to go into the code and change some enum.</p>

<p>I figured a config file would not be very secure, for in the end it's just a text file that a user could potentially view after purchasing the app. May not be a huge problem if a user saw the ID, but I don't like the idea of anybody seeing the innards that go through a payment process</p>

<p>Assuming im making sense here, whats a good way to expose these IDs but still keep them secure so users may not find them?</p>

<p>Also curious, how secure is something like an enum in c++? Can people break the .exe down and see the code and its values?</p>

<p>When I resize the window <code>.listing .listingContent</code> becomes 530px like it should be, due to this almost identical function</p>

I can place them anywhere though. I was thinking maybe I could use append somehow but then the fade effect is lost.</p>

class Staff extends Person{

<p>I want to apply validation using JSR-303 on class Staff whereby Staff address and phone cannot have the value of null. However, I have some other classes that are class of Person where I don't wish to have the validation to be applied. </p>

<p>One way to do this that I could think of is by refactor Person and push the fields 'address' and 'phone' to Staff, but this means refactoring a lot of other classes (and not to mention redundancy this shall cause), and hence something I want to avoid.</p>

<p>Update.
I have changed Staff class, as follows</p>

<pre><code>public class Staff extends Person {
    @NotNull
    private String staffEmploymentId;

    public String getStaffEmploymentId() {
        return staffEmploymentId;
    }

    public void setStaffEmploymentId(String id) {
        this.staffEmploymentId = id;
    }

    @Override
    @NotNull
    public void setPhones(List&lt;Phone&gt; phones) {
        super.phones = phones;
    }

    @Override
    @NotNull
    public void setAddress(Address a) {
        super.address = a;
    }

    @Override
    @NotNull
    public Address getAddress(){
        return super.address;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, I've got the following error.</p>

<ul>
<li>id</li>
<li>product</li>
<li>name</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea of the site is that the user starts typing the “name”, and the products show up after a couple of keystrokes. My query looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$query = mysql_query(""SELECT product FROM mytable WHERE name LIKE '%"".$search.""%'"");
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works, except when there is a space in the “name”. For example, if I have a name called “Coca Cola”, the script successfully lists the product when I type “Coca”, but as soon as I type the space, it no longer returns any rows.</p>

<p>I've searched everywhere for a solution. I understand that the space is interpreted as a separator of some kind, but can I get the database to interpret the space as ... well ... a space? If not, is there a better way of doing what I want to accomplish?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I ran it in PHPMyAdmin and it actually returns the correct results, which leads me to believe that it must be something in the PHP. Theres the full script:</p>

<pre><code>$search = $_GET['search'];
$already_echoed = array();

if (!ereg('[^A-Za-z0-9]', $search) &amp;&amp; strlen($search) &gt; 2) {

 $query = mysql_query(""SELECT product FROM mytable WHERE name LIKE '%"".$search.""%'"");

 if (mysql_num_rows($query) &gt; 0) {

  echo '&lt;h4&gt;Suggestions:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;';

  while ($product = mysql_fetch_array($query)) {

   if (!in_array($product['product'], $already_echoed)) {
    $getProduct = mysql_query(""SELECT name, shortname FROM products WHERE id='"".$product['product'].""'"");
    $product2 = mysql_fetch_array($getProduct);

    echo '&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://' . $product2['shortname'] . '.mydomain.com""&gt;' . $product2['name'] . '&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;';
    $already_echoed[] = $product['product'];
   }

<p>My service has JNI implementation which creates another thread.
The reason for having another thread is to have the capability of canceling operation while monitoring the call back.</p>

<p>This mechanism worked well in Android Kitkat release but it crashes in Android L.</p>

<p>Between two threads, I stored the JavaVM* that I get from GetJavaVM(env) to a static global variable. Of course, this shared data is protected by pthread mutex.</p>

<p>I have tried the following so far, but all of them below still crashed :</p>

<p>1) Used JavaVM* I get from JNI onLoad() function by store it to global</p>

<p>2) In the new thread, as there is only one JavaVM running on Android, get the vm from calling  android::AndroidRuntime::getJavaVM();</p>

<p>3) Stored the vm information in the main thread after calling NewGlobalRef(). And saved that reference to the shared data. The new thread used the reference from NewGlobalRef().</p>

<p>Does anyone know what is significantly changed in JNI environment on Android L release? </p>

<p>UPDATE :</p>

<p>Debugged further and the solution I mentioned 1) or 2) should have worked.
The actual issue was due to the garbage collection running more frequently. So the HAL pointer I kept was not valid any more...</p>

<p>I am trying to use the value of a loop counter inside another function inside the loop. I know this is related to function closures. Its getting a little confusing. I figure if someone can explain on this problem, I'd understand. </p>

<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; foo.length; i++) {
    // $('&lt;li/&gt;').addClass('box').append($('&lt;img/&gt;').attr({'src':foo[i].image, 'data-phrase':foo[i].phrase}).hide()).appendTo($('ul.boxPack'))
    $('&lt;li/&gt;').addClass('box')
              .attr('data-phrase', foo[i].phrase)
              .bind('click', function (i) {
                   alert(i);
                   console.log(foo[2]);
                   $(this).append($('&lt;img/&gt;').attr('src', foo[2].image))
               })
              .appendTo($('ul.boxPack'));
}

I`ve been working on building an eCommerce using NetBeans but I have customized most of the code suggested by the tutorials to better fit my needs. So far understanding JSTL and JAVA... I was wondering, how do I build breadcrumbs to restrain the number of products that display per page?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>24 per page   48 per page   96 per page   View All
</code></pre>

<p>The number of products will also generate the number of pages there is to display. </p>

<p>For example, if there are <code>48 products</code> for that particular <code>category</code> and the user chooses to display <code>24 products per page</code>, logically the application should display <code>2 pages.</code> Anyway, you get the gist of it. </p>

<p>How do I go about adding that logic to my existing application? I know it has something to do with <code>algorithms</code> and probably <code>java.strings</code>... </p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>The sample data I used is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;model:QuestionCollection xmlns:model=""clr-namespace:Reuma_Toolbox.Model""&gt;
    ....
    &lt;model:Question Title=""En groente?""&gt;
        &lt;model:Question.Answers&gt;
            &lt;model:AnswerCollection RadioButton=""True""&gt;
                &lt;model:Answer Id=""spinach"" IsChecked=""True"" /&gt;
                &lt;model:Answer Id=""patato"" /&gt;
            &lt;/model:AnswerCollection&gt;
        &lt;/model:Question.Answers&gt;
    &lt;/model:Question&gt;
    &lt;model:Question Title=""Hoe vaak eet je spinazie, toe zeg vertel het me!"" &gt;
        &lt;model:Question.Answers&gt;
            &lt;model:AnswerCollection RadioButton=""False""&gt;
                &lt;model:Answer Id=""0"" Label=""1"" Title=""Zonder enige moeilijkheid"" /&gt;
                &lt;model:Answer Id=""1"" Label=""2"" Title=""Elke dag"" /&gt;
                &lt;model:Answer Id=""2"" Label=""3"" Title=""Nooit"" IsChecked=""True""/&gt;
                &lt;model:Answer Id=""3"" Label=""4"" Title=""Onmogelijk"" /&gt;
            &lt;/model:AnswerCollection&gt;
        &lt;/model:Question.Answers&gt;
    &lt;/model:Question&gt;
    ....
&lt;/model:QuestionCollection&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So basically a list of questions, each question has either a set of checkboxes or a set of radio buttons.</p>

<p>What I need is that in case RadioButton=""False"", the layout changes from a horizontal row of radio buttons to a vertical list of checkboxes and labels. I really have no clue how to achieve this. Triggers? Different style?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: after you kind replies, I know it is a bug in gcc, which won't be fixed until v5.  Whether using copy initialization or direct initialization, calling <code>make_pair</code> always requires a move or copy constructor, which gives error under current buggy gcc.  So my question is how to rewrite my code easily to circumvent the bug.  I have a class hierarchy which has a member of type <code>stringstream</code>.  Removing it would cause too much headache.

<pre><code>from django.db import models

class StreetAddress(models.Model):
    street_name = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    building_number = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField()

    def __str__(self):
        return ""%s %d"" % (self.street_name, self.building_number)

class Cafe(StreetAddress):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=64)
</code></pre>

<p>StreetAddress intentionally created as non-abstract, because i suppose its instances being created independently from the cafe instances or another possible descendants.
Let's try to create some cafe located by some address:</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; from heir_demo.models import StreetAddress, Cafe
&gt;&gt;&gt; addr = StreetAddress.objects.create(street_name='Piccadilly', building_number=5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; addr
&lt;StreetAddress: Piccadilly 5&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; mollys = Cafe.objects.create(streetaddress_ptr=addr, name='Mollys')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;console&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  ...  stacktrace goes here ...
Warning: Column 'building_number' cannot be null
</code></pre>

<p>The question is -- why django requires fields of ancestor model when i specified instance of this model explicitly?</p>

<p>I understand that it could be fixed by a little workaround like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Cafe(StreetAddress):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=64)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.streetaddress_ptr is not None:
            for field in self.streetaddress_ptr._meta.local_fields:
                if field.name != 'id':
                setattr(
                    self,
                    field.name,
                    getattr(self.streetaddress_ptr, field.name)
                )

        return super(Cafe, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>Now it works just as expected:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from heir_demo.models import StreetAddress, Cafe
&gt;&gt;&gt; addr = StreetAddress.objects.all()[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; mollys = Cafe.objects.create(streetaddress_ptr=addr, name='Mollys')
&gt;&gt;&gt; mollys
&lt;Cafe: Piccadilly 5&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Please, explain me -- why it does not work without any workaround? Isn't it  the most consistent and predictable behavior?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>I know that the working object has 3 rows and 3 cols at the point where <code>working.get_element(i, j);</code> is called. The variable list shows me just before the <code>get_element()</code> method, that both rows and cols are set to 3. In the method, I'm able to get the value at <code>get_element(0, 0)</code> but not <code>get_element(0, 1)</code>.</p>

<p>I can't see why this is the case... Anyone know why or require more of my code to understand why these methods are being called?</p>

<p>And finally the code to place where I want the plugin to apper:</p>

Ideally, what I would like is to be able to add <em>typed</em> properties, so that the ""value"" returned is always of the type that I want it to be.</p>

<p>The type should always be a primitive. This class subclasses an abstract class which basically stores the name and value as string. The idea being that this subclass will add some type-safety to the base class (as well as saving me on some conversion).</p>

<p>So, I have created a class which is (roughly) this:</p>

<p>I'm using:</p>

<ul>
<li>MVVMlight and its <code>EventToCommand</code> behaviors</li>
<li>The animal is a simple <code>Border</code> listening on <code>MouseDown</code></li>
<li>The barn is an <code>ItemsControl</code> bound to an <code>ObservableCollection</code> of the ViewModel. It listens to 3 events:
<ul>
<li><code>DragEnter</code> (adds a dummy animal into the <code>ObservableCollection</code> to preview where the animal is placed in the barn)</li>
<li><code>DragLeave</code> (removes the dummy animal if the animal isn't dropped)</li>
<li><code>Drop</code> (sets the animal to the designated place in the barn).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry. I don't have the reputation to upload images. So I try some ascii arts (try to image dragging the donkey into the barn): </p>

<pre><code>Shop   | Barn
-------------------------
Mouse  | [Mouse] [Dog] 
Cat    | [.]
Dog    |  ^
Donkey-|--|
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Here's the problem:</strong></p>

<p>If I drag an animal into the barn onto it's designated space (the preview dummy):</p>

<ol>
<li><code>DragLeave</code> removes the dummy item and immediately the</li>
<li><code>DragEnter</code> will be fired to redraw the dummy item. Goto step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>An inifite loop. The flickering is up and running!</p>

<p><strong>Does anyone know a nice little workaround?</strong></p>

<p>So here's the code of my ViewModel:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>private string _dummy;
public ObservableCollection&lt;string&gt; Animals { get; private set; }

private void StartDrag(FrameworkElement element)
{
    var animal = element.DataContext as string;
    if (animal == null) return;
    System.Windows.DragDrop.DoDragDrop(element, animal, DragDropEffects.Copy);
}

private void PreviewDrop(DragEventArgs args)

    if (args.Data.GetDataPresent(typeof (string)))
        AddDummy();
}

private void StopDrop(DragEventArgs args)
{
    RemoveDummy();
}

private void Drop(DragEventArgs args)
{
    var animal = args.Data.GetData(typeof (string)) as string;
    if (animal == null) return;

    RemoveDummy();
    Animals.Add(animal);
}

private void RemoveDummy()
{
    if (_dummy == null) return;
    Animals.Remove(_dummy);
    _dummy = null;
}

    if (_dummy != null) return;

<p>but when I run a second ffmpeg instance with the following command: </p>

<p>... the file goes on and on and on.. and will only get larger.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>REGEX</em></strong> is placing each ""UNIT PARTS"" and the following code until the NEXT ""UNIT PARTS"" into a string[].
After this, I am checking each string[] to see if the ""NAME"" section exists in a different list. If it does exist, I am outputting that ""UNIT PARTS"" at the end of a textfile.</p>

<p>Here's the JS that does the request:</p>

<pre><code>var r = new XMLHttpRequest();
r.open('GET', 'https://dev.mysite.com/rest', true);
r.send();
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what should happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>Client: XHR POST request to /rest</li>
<li>Server: responds with HTTP 302 redirect to /rest/</li>
<li>Client: Follow that redirect</li>
</ol>

<p>But after step 2, Chrome cancels the request. If there was no HTTP 302, the request would work perfectly. I've confirmed this.</p>

<p>When the request runs, I can see in Chrome's Network panel only one XHR -- a canceled POST request with no response headers or response body.</p>

<p>Debugging with Chrome's net-internals tool, I see that there was a response sent from the server, and after that, the request was cancelled. Here is the output of the request:</p>

<p>At the end, you can see ""Cancelled"" because of ""URL_REQUEST_BLOCKED_ON_DELEGATE"". I don't know what that means. But again, if there was no HTTP 302 redirect, the error would not occur.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Then this class to set the fragment with fragment transacation</p>

<p><strong>SetDiningCommonsActivity.java</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class SetDiningCommonsActivity extends Activity {

 @Override

  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

  getFragmentManager().beginTransaction().replace(android.R.id.content,

<p>Then in my main activity this is the code to link to the new fragment</p>

<p><strong>MainActivity.java</strong></p>

<pre><code>@Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
            Intent intent = new Intent();
            intent.setClass(MainActivity.this, SetDiningCommonsActivity.class);
            startActivityForResult(intent, 0); 
        }
</code></pre>

<p>So whenever I click the card that links to new Fragment, the app crashes. the NullPointer in the Logcat points to this line.</p>

<pre><code>        mCardView.setSwipeable(false);
</code></pre>

<p>I believe it has something to do with this line.</p>

<pre><code>        mCardView = (CardUI) getActivity().findViewById(R.id.cardsview);

<p>E.g. as File B starts with 3, 6, 2 ...</p>

<p>File A will be</p>

<pre><code>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

<p>As the strings and numbers are 200 I changed the array into a scalar value to work on every numbers of every strings.</p>

<p>I'm working on this. and I know I suppose to use a pos function but i do not know how to match each number with each string. is reading the string first by while? or using for to know how many time that I have to run this to achieve the result?</p>

This consult sql is made per a web php, and return a json, and i show it with Angularjs, so i call it only one time, because my web only load one time,  my question is, </p>

<ol>
<li>How optimal is to do this? Because some time the result is big.

<ul>
<li>It would be more efficient to query for each table?</li>
<li>Exist other method for do it?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Maybe i can make a Vertical Menu for group all data, but i think is necessary do the same sentence , right?

<ul>
<li>if is not, them is more efficient, call many time a little left join, because if i have a preload data, i can call only specific tables, or is more efficient call all data one time and filter, route, hide , show with Angularjs.</li>
<li>if is Yes, other solution.</li>

<p>As zero-initialization is done always then one should look at the constant initialization.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.6.2.2 A constant initializer for an object o is an expression that is a constant expression, except that it may also invoke constexpr
  constructors for o and its subobjects even if those objects are of
  non-literal class types [ Note: such a class may have a non-trivial
  destructor —end note ]. Constant initialization is performed:</p>
  
  <p>— if each full-expression (including implicit conversions) that
  appears in the initializer of a reference with static or thread
  storage duration is a constant expression (5.19) and the reference is
  bound to an lvalue designating an object with static storage duration
  or to a temporary (see 12.2);</p>
  
  <p>— if an object with static or thread storage duration is <strong>initialized
  by a constructor call, and if the initialization full-expression is a
  constant initializer for the object</strong>;</p>
  
  <p>— if an object with static or thread storage duration is <strong>not
  initialized by a constructor call and if either the object is
  value-initialized</strong> or <strong>every full-expression that appears in its
  initializer is a constant expression</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I omitted the reference as it is not important in my case. How <em>I</em> understand the standard is that there are 3 cases:</p>

<ol>
<li>ctor</li>
<li>no-ctor and value initialization</li>
<li>no-ctor and constant expression</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's say I have a following class:</p>

<pre><code>struct X {
  bool flag = false;
  // = {} will break VS2013 CTP so in that case use the
  // regular ctor, which sadly still can't be declared constexpr
  std::aligned_storage&lt;sizeof(int), alignof(int)&gt;::type storage = {};
};
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I can say this class is perfectly valid for constant initialization (each element can be constantly initialized). Is this true?</p>

<p>Does this class require a <code>constexpr</code> constructor?</p>

<p>Is constant initialization guaranteed for C++11 as well as C++98?</p>

<p>Side question: When will the static initialization done in case of so/dll? During the load time, or it might be delayed even further?</p>

<pre><code>someArray.remove(element)

<p>I wanted to use the <code>extend</code> operator of CoffeeScript and do it the following:</p>

<pre><code>Array::remove = (element) -&gt;
  return false unless _.include(this, element)
  this = this.splice(_.indexOf(this, element), 1)
  true
</code></pre>

<p>But the prototype function, that is created points <code>this</code> to the <code>Array</code> object itself, so the only way is to return something, which would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>someArray = someArray.remove(element)
</code></pre>

<p>and the implementation for that like this:</p>

<pre><code>Array::remove = (element) -&gt;
  return this unless _.include(this, element)
  this.splice(_.indexOf(this, element), 1)
</code></pre>

<p>In ruby this is the exact difference between <code>join</code> and <code>join!</code>.</p>

When attempting to put a new item in the cache, occasionally a cache specific exception will be thrown with a code of <code>DataCacheErrorCode.RetryLater</code>. Naturally, in order to retry later without needing to block on this method I made it async and <code>await Task.Delay</code> to try again a short time later. Previously a developer had hardcoded a <code>Thread.Sleep</code> in there that was really hurting application performance.</p>

<p>The method signature looks something similar to this now:</p>

<pre><code>public static async Task Put(string cacheKey, object obj)
</code></pre>

<p>Following this change I get ~75 compiler warnings from all the other places in the application that called the formerly synchronous version of Put indicating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because this call is not awaited, execution of the current method continues before the call is completed. Consider applying the 'await' operator to the result of the call.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case since Put doesn't return anything it makes sense to me to let this operation fire and forget as I don't see any reason to block execution of the method that called it. I'm just wondering if there are any dangers or pitfalls of allowing a lot of these fire and forgets Tasks running in the background as Put can be called quite often. Or should I await anyways since 99% of the time I won't get the retry error and it will finish almost immediately. Want to make sure that I'm not incurring any penalties for having too many threads or something like that.</p>

The SpeechRecognizedEventArgstext is ""one left arrow"" when I want ""one, left arrow"" or a list where the first item is ""one"" and the second is ""left arrow"".</p>

<p>I've found a ""Words"" property which is nearly what I want but not quite. If style for a way to make them comma separated or some event for when any single phase from the grammar is find so I get them one by one instead of in an inseparable group. Some of my code:</p>

<p>This works okay in interactive mode but does nothing when running from the command line. From a conversation on IRC, this is because stdout isn't available by default to threads.</p>

<p>Really what I'm looking for is a way to idiomatically apply a function to each line of the CSV file and do so in parallel. I'd also like to print some results to stdout during testing if at all possible.</p>

<ol>
<li>Should I code this <code>ServiceConnection</code>, in a thread separate from UI thread. (How?)</li>
<li>Or, should I continue using it as I'm doing it right now. i.e. within the MainActivity?</li>

<p>I want to transform one financial time series list into another where the second series list will be same length or shorter than the first list (usually it will be shorter, i.e., it becomes a new list where the elements themselves represent aggregation of information of one or more elements from the 1st list).  How it collapses the list from one to the other depends on the data in the first list.  The algorithm needs to track a calculation that gets reset upon new elements added to second list.  It may be easier to describe via an example:</p>

<p>List 1 (time ordered from beginning to end series of closing prices and volume):</p>

<p>{P=7,V=1}, {P=10,V=2}, {P=10,V=1}, {P=10,V=3}, {P=11,V=5}, {P=12,V=1}, {P=13,V=2}, {P=17,V=1}, {P=15,V=4}, {P=14,V=10}, {P=14,V=8}, {P=10,V=2}, {P=9,V=3}, {P=8,V=1}</p>

<p>List 2 (series of open/close price ranges and summation of volume for such range period using these 2 param settings to transform list 1 to list 2: param 1: Price Range Step Size = 3, param 2: Price Range Reversal Step Size = 6):</p>

<p>{O=7,C=10,V=1+2+1}, {O=10,C=13,V=3+5+1+2}, {O=13,C=16,V=0}, {O=16,C=10,V=1+4+10+8+2}, {O=10,C=8,V=3+1}</p>

<p>In list 2, I explicitly am showing the summation of the V attributes from list 1 in list 2.  But V is just a long so it would just be one number in reality.  So how this works is opening time series price is 7.  Then we are looking for first price from this initial starting price where delta is 3 away from 7 (via param 1 setting).  In list 1, as we move thru the list, the next step is upwards move to 10 and thus we've established an ""up trend"".  So now we build our first element in list 2 with Open=7,Close=10 and sum up the Volume of all bars used in first list to get to this first step in list 2.  Now, next element starting point is 10.  To build another up step, we need to advance another 3 upwards to create another up step or we could reverse and go downwards 6 (param 2).  With data from list 1, we reach 13 first, so that builds our second element in list 2 and sums up all the V attributes used to get to this step.  We continue on this process until end of list 1 processing.  </p>

<p>Note the gap jump that happens in list 1.  We still want to create a step element of {O=13,C=16,V=0}.  The V of 0 is simply stating that we have a range move that went thru this step but had Volume of 0 (no actual prices from list 1 occurred here - it was above it but we want to build the set of steps that lead to price that was above it).  </p>

<p>Second to last entry in list 2 represents the reversal from up to down.</p>

<p>Final entry in list 2 just uses final Close from list 1 even though it really hasn't finished establishing full range step yet.</p>

<p>Thanks for any pointers of how this could be potentially done via Linq if at all.</p>

&lt;/div&gt;

<p>The jQuery </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;

    function myCall() {
        var request = $.ajax({
            url: ""processor.php"",
            type: ""GET"",            
            dataType: ""html""

        request.done(function(msg) {
            $(""#mybox"").html(msg);          
        });

        request.fail(function(jqXHR, textStatus) {
            alert( ""Request failed: "" + textStatus );
        });
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this works fine when just echoing a test message, however the form data is not sent as it obviously needs wrapping in a form tag, when I do this I get the following error come up.</p>

<pre><code>Request failed: error

<pre><code>class SomeClass
{
    public ImportantData data = null;
    public Thread t = null;

    public SomeClass(ImportantData d)
    {
        t = new MyOperationThread();

        // t.start(); // Footnote 1

        data = d;

        t.start();    // Footnote 2
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>ImportantData is some generic box of stuff (presumably important) and MyOperationThread is a subclass of thread that knows how to handle SomeClass instances.</p>

<p>Footnodes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I totally understand why this is unsafe.  If the MyOperationThread tries to access SomeClass.data before the following statement finishes (and data is initialized) I'll get an exception that I was otherwise unprepared for.  Or maybe I won't.  You can't always tell with threads.  In any case, I'm setting myself up for weird, unexpected behavior later.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't understand why doing it this way is forbidden territory.  At this point, all of SomeClass' members have been initialized, no other member functions that change state have been called, and construction is thus effectively finished.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>From what I understand, the reason it's considered bad practice to do this is that you can ""leak a reference to an object that has not yet been fully constructed.""  But the object has been fully constructed, the constructor has nothing left to do but return.  I have searched other questions looking for a more concrete answer to this question, and have looked into referenced material as well, but haven't found anything that says ""you shouldn't because such and such undesirable behavior,"" only things that say ""you shouldn't.""</p>

<p>How would starting a thread in the constructor be conceptually different from this situation:</p>

<pre><code>class SomeClass
{
    public ImportantData data = null;

    public SomeClass(ImportantData d)
    {
        // OtherClass.someExternalOperation(this); // Not a good idea

        data = d;

        OtherClass.someExternalOperation(this);    // Usually accepted as OK
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As another aside, what if the class was final?</p>

<pre><code>final class SomeClass // like this
{
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>I saw plenty of questions asking about this and answers that you shouldn't, but none offered explanations, so I figured I'd try to add one that has a few more details.</p>

"22744562","1","","","2014-03-30 13:31:13","","1","109","<p>Long story short, i have to solve 20..200 block-tridiagonal linear systems during an iterational process. Size of systems is 50..100 blocks, 50..100 x 50..100 each. I will write down here my thoughts on it, and i ask you to share your opinion on my thoughts, as it is possible that i am mistaken in one regard or another.</p>

<p>To solve those equations, i use a matrix version of Thomas algorithm. It's exactly like scalar one, except instead of scalar coefficients in equations i have matrices (i.e. instead of ""a_i x_{i-1} + b_i x_i + c_i x_{i+1} = f_i"" i have ""A_i X_{i-1} + B_i X_i + C_i X_{i+1} = F_i"", where A_i, B_i, C_i - matrices; F_i and X_i are vectors.</p>

<p>Asymptotic complexity of such algorithm is O(N*M^3), where N is the size of overall matrix in blocks, and M is the size of each block.</p>

<p>Right now my bottleneck is inversion operation. Deep inside nested loops i have to calculate /a lot/ of inversions that look like ""(c_i - a_i * alpha_i)^-1"", where alpha_i is a dense MxM matrix. I am doing it using Gauss-Jordan algorithm, using additional memory (which i will have to use anyway later in the program) and O(M^3) operations.</p>

<p>Trying to find info on how to optimize inversion operation, i've found only threads about solving AX=B systems 'canonically', i.e. X=A^-1 B, with suggestions to use LU factorization instead of it. Sadly, as my inversion is a part of Thomas algorithm, if i resort to LU factorization, i will have to do it for a M*NxM*N matrix, which wil rise the complexity of solving the linear system by extra N^2 to O(N^3*M^3). That's slowing down by a factor of 2500..10000, which is quite bad.</p>

<p>Approximate or iterative inversions are out of scope, too, as slightest residual with exact inversion will cumulate very fast and cause global iterational process to explode.</p>

<p>I do calculations in parallel with Parallel.For(), solving each of the 20..200 systems separately.</p>

<p>Right now, to solve 20 such systems with N,M=50 on average takes 872ms (i7-3630QM, 2.4Ghz, 4cores (8 with hyper threading)).</p>

<p>And finally, here come the questions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Am i correct on what i wrote here? Is there an algorithm to significantly speed up calculations over what they are now?</p></li>
<li><p>Inside of number-grinder part of my program i use only For loops (most of them are with constant boundaries, the exception being one of the loops inside of inversion algorithm) double arithmetic (+,-,*,/) and standard arrays ([], [,], [,,]). Will there be any speed-up if i rewrite this part as unsafe? Or as a library in C?</p></li>
<li><p>How much is C# overhead on such tasks (double arrays grinding)? Are C compilers better at optimization of such simple code than C# 'compiler'?</p></li>
<li><p>What should i look at when optimizing numbergrinder in C#? Is it suited for such task at all?</p></li>

<p>Let's say I am using <code>c:forEach</code> to print a server-side generated content using JSP, like a list of fields.</p>

<p>Now I need to create a button where those fields will be added dinamically with javascript by the user (following the same template as the fields already printed from the server).</p>

<p>I am thinking of using angular to keep track of model changes instead of using plain jQuery, but I am having problems to use it with JSP.</p>

<p>My goal is to avoid angular to create the initial loop and to make it deal only with dynamic content manipulation after the HTML was generated by the application.</p>

<p>Is there a way to print a list of items using regular server-side language and then add angular just for the dinamic manipulation?</p>

<p>The example below would be the final HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class=""container""&gt;

    &lt;!-- Here is a initial server-side content generated from application output --&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Server generated Content&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;!-- Here is a initial server-side content generated from application output --&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Server generated Content2&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- Clicking here add a new item inside "".container"", it should be controlled by angular but I can't find a good pattern to do it --&gt;
&lt;button&gt;Add new list element&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, am I using angular in the correct way?</p>

<p>EDIT:
I don't want to generate again the same content using JSON format, I want to leverage angular and the regular HTML markup. Does that make sense?</p>

<pre><code>wget -r -H -nc -np -nH -e robots=off -l1 -i ./itemlist.txt -B 'http://archive.org/download/'
</code></pre>

<p>Which results in folders organised thus from a root, for example:</p>

<pre><code>./IDENTIFIER1/file.blah
./IDENTIFIER1/something.la
./IDENTIFIER1/thumbnails/IDENTIFIER_thumb001.gif
./IDENTIFIER1/thumbnails/IDENTIFIER_thumb002.gif
./IDENTIFIER1/IDENTIFIER_files.xml

./IDENTIFIER2/etc.etc
./IDENTIFIER2/blah.blah
./IDENTIFIER2/thumbnails/IDENTIFIER_thumb001.gif

 etc
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>IDENTIFIER</code> is the name of a collection of files that comes from archive.org, hence, in each folder, there is also the file called <code>IDENTIFIER_files.xml</code> which contains checksums for all the files in that folder, wrapped in the various xml tags.</p>

<p>Since this is a bulk download and there's hundreds of files, the idea is to write some sort of script (preferably bash? <strong>Edit:</strong> Maybe PHP?) that can select each .xml file and scrape it for the hashes to test them against the files to reveal any corrupted, failed or modified downloads.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>From archive.org/details/NuclearExplosion, XML is:</p>

<p><a href=""https://archive.org/download/NuclearExplosion/NuclearExplosion_files.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/download/NuclearExplosion/NuclearExplosion_files.xml</a></p>

<p>If you check that link you can see there's both the option for MD5 or SHA1 hashes in the XML, as well as the relative file paths in the file tag (which will be the same as locally).</p>

<p>So. How do we:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>For each folder of <code>IDENTIFIER</code>, select and scrape the XML for each filename and the checksum of choice;</p></li>
<li><p>Actually test the checksum for each file;</p></li>
<li><p>Log outputs of failed checksums to a file that lists only the failed <code>IDENTIFIER</code> (say a file called <code>./RetryIDs.txt</code> for example), so a download reattempt can be tried using that list...</p>

<pre><code>wget -r -H -nc -np -nH -e robots=off -l1 -i ./RetryIDs.txt -B 'http://archive.org/download/'
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Any leads on how to piece this together would be extremely helpful.</p>

<p>And another added incentive---probably a good idea too, if there is a solution, if we let archive.org know so they can put it on their blog. I'm sure I'm not the only one that will find this very useful!</p>

<p>Thanks all in advance. </p>

<p>The team responsible for the Config module implemented an interface which consists only of 2 classes. 2 classes that are responsible for getting, caching and providing the particular values (via properties).</p>

<p>I feel that this is a bad design, in my opinion, it would be better to define all the config values one may access via the interface, but not actual classes that implement this behaviour.</p>

<p>In my opinion, for something like getting config values, it would be more logical to give an interface that shows me what values I will be able to access, but not a class (which implementation e.g. the properties is not controlled by the interface).</p>

<p><strong>-edit-</strong>
The Interface looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IConfigurationResolver
{
    GeneralConfiguration GetGeneralConfiguration(string Id);
    SpecificConfiguration GetSpecificConfiguration(string Id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is implemented by one class. What I meant is that this interfaces really just defines two classes that are each responsible for providing the configuration values, whereas I think it would be better if the interface did not care about such details and should provide the config values itself </p>

<p>These are very experienced developers, whereas I am not, so what is your stand on this?</p>

<p>The parameter <code>StaffId</code> is assigned from a dataset by default and is hidden.</p>

<p>Note - The server and report name are obviously specified in the URL!</p>

<p>The issue that I'm facing is that when running the above report, if I change the <code>Month</code> or <code>Year</code> parameter, <code>StaffId</code> is also updated from the dataset associated to it which is not the behavior that I would like.</p>

<p>What I would like is that if <code>StaffId</code> is specified in the URL, it should not change / be updated from the dataset. I would still want the user to be able to change <code>Month</code> and <code>Year</code>. Does anyone know how to achieve this?</p>

<p>I'm aware of parameter refreshing in the advanced parameter options but this does have the option for an expression.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I've tried using the 'Never Refresh' option but it still seems to refresh. In case it makes a difference, there is dependencies on the parameter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The server application shall:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Listen for TCP connections on a well known IP address and port </li>
  <li>Accept connections initiated on that port </li>
  <li>Receive messages from the client and echo them back </li>
  <li>Continue to do this until the client drops the connection.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>The client application shall:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Establish a connection with the server at its well known IP address and port </li>
  <li>Send messages in an asynchronous manner to the server. The format of the message is 
       of your choice; however, it must contain enough information in order for it to be 
       recognized on its return from the server.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I have completed the coding for Server, and this is what i've come up with for the client.</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What does it mean that Server listens for TCP connections on a well known IP and Port In my implementation, i've used <code>ServerSocket</code> which accepts the port server listens on. Did i interpret it correctly?</p></li>
<li><p>In my current implementation of TCPClient, client sends messages to Server, but the println() seems to be a blocking call, which makes it Synchronous. What can i do to make my client asynchronous? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>For brevity, I havent added the code of TCPServer, let me know if it is needed</p>

<p>UPDATE*<strong>*</strong>
Based on the feedback, i have modified by TCPClient class. After receiving client request, i spawn two threads ReceiveMessage and SendMessage. Doing that gives me following exception:</p>

<p>But MySQL returns the error 1064 ""<em>Syntax error on line 7, check your manual</em>"". Line 7 is the one that begins with <code>WHILE</code>.</p>

<p>I also tried with this <code>INSERT</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO account (login, password)
VALUES (concat('test', i), '*00A51F3F48415C7D4E8908980D443C29C69B60C9');
</code></pre>

<p>But without any luck, MySQL gives back the same error.</p>

<p>Is there something I'm missing? Or this is something that just can't be accomplished?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

The gist of it is that every thread has its own priority queue where it gets work (a std::multiset) and a mutex lock corresponding to that queue that is locked whenever it needs to be modified.  </p>

<p>Every node has an owner thread which corresponds to the node ID modulo thread count. If a thread is looking through a node's neighbors and updates one of their weights (label) to something lower than it was before, it locks its owner's queue and removes/reinserts (this is to force the set to update its position in the queue). However, this implementation seems to deadlock. I can't tell why though because as far as I can tell, each thread holds only one lock at a time.  </p>

<p>Each thread's initial queue contains all of its nodes, but every node's weight besides the source is initialized to ULONG_MAX. If a thread is out of work (it's getting nodes with ULONG_MAX weight from the queue) it just keeps locking and unlocking until another thread gives it work.  </p>

<p>I need a few pointers towards the resources available that can help me build this GUI and have it available as a plugin so I can get the ball rolling. I've looked at the suggestions in the link above but I don't feel like my plugin needs for example a model, view, controller design pattern. I just need the ability to have a GUI pop up when the user starts the plugin and have them interact with it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>groupId will identify your project uniquely across all projects, so we need to enforce a naming schema. It has to follow the package name rules, what means that has to be at least as a domain name you control, and you can create as many subgroups as you want. eg. org.apache.maven, org.apache.commons 
  A good way to determine the granularity of the groupId is to use the project structure. That is, if the current project is a multiple module project, it should append a new identifier to the parent's groupId. 
  eg. org.apache.maven, org.apache.maven.plugins, org.apache.maven.reporting</p>

<p>What I would like to know is this: How close is the rounding in JavaScript to the the C# equivalent? The reason I'm doing this is because I would like to take a JavaScript method that uses <code>Math.Round</code> and rewrite the same method into C# and would like to know that I would be able to get the same results after rounding a number.</p>

<p>The server is dedicated to this task and I want to wring the maximum performance out of the hardware (but no I don't want to implement it in C++). </p>

<p>The simplest implementation would be to have a single Java process which creates and monitors a number of worker threads. An alternative would be to run a Java process for each worker. </p>

<p>Assuming for arguments sake a quadcore Linux server which of these solutions would you anticipate being more performant and why?</p>

<p>You can assume the workers never need to communicate with one another.</p>

<p>The <code>truthy</code> method is fine when I know the type of my argument, but I'm consuming data from a source that lacks that type info, so I'd like a function with signature <code>Any =&gt; Option[Boolean]</code> that will try all of the <code>Truthy</code> implementations in scope and return the result if one can be found. Obviously I could write </p>

<pre><code>def getTruth(a:Any) = a match {

  case StringTruthy(b) =&gt; Some(b)

<p>I'm new to <code>SwingWorker</code> so please bear with me.</p>

<p>I'm using a GUI and when the user presses a button it executes some methods I've in another class. This class just has methods inside and I need those methods to run on their own thread. The thing is, those methods need to be passed arguments and they will also return something needed to other methods. </p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {

   public  ArrayList&lt;Train&gt; proccessTrain(int endTime, int startTime, ArrayList&lt;Train&gt; trainList)
   {
       (... I start processing data here... with sets and gets to the stationDataList array...)

       return trainList;
   }

   public int getNumberOfCrashes(ArrayList&lt;Train&gt; trainList)
   {
       (... I run over the array... do some comparasions... and do some sets on the Train object in the array...)

       return numOfCrashes;
   }

}
</code></pre>

<p>And my GUI Class:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyGUI{

   MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
   ArrayList&lt;Train&gt; trainList = new ArrayList&lt;Train&gt;();

   (later on there are Train ojects added into the array)

   (when button is pressed)

       trainList = myClass.proccessTrain(20, 10, trainList);
       int numberOfCrashes = myClass.getNumberOfCrashes(trainList);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'll also need to update the GUI and this is not an issue to me as I know I can use the <code>publish()</code> and override the <code>process()</code> method in the swing worker.
My problem is how can I return the methods to the variables in the GUI and how can I pass arguments to the methods in <code>MyClass.class</code>, as <code>doInBackground()</code> does not accept arguments.</p>

<p>Also, I need the swingworker to be inside the method and not on the <code>MyGUI.class</code>, so something like this (eg for the processTrain method):</p>

<pre><code>public  ArrayList&lt;Train&gt; proccessTrain(int endTime, int startTime, ArrayList&lt;Train&gt; trainList)
{
    SwingWorker&lt;String, Integer&gt; worker = new SwingWorker&lt;String, String&gt;() {
        @Override
        protected String doInBackground() throws Exception {

            return 
        }

        protected void done() {

        }

        @Override
        protected void process(List&lt;Integer&gt; chunks) {

        }
    };

    worker.execute();
</code></pre>

<p>What I pretend is to execute the method <code>processTrains</code> in a new <code>swingworker</code> <code>thread</code>. As you can see, the <code>processTrains</code> method requires a parameter, an <code>ArrayList</code> of Train. So my question is when I create the swing worker how can I pass the parameters, in this case the <code>ArrayList</code> of <code>Train</code>, to the <code>doInBackground</code> and how can I return the process <code>ArrayList&lt;Train&gt;</code> to the variable processedTrains,. </p>

This is easier with SQL  Server Management Studio, but in this case I have to deploy using a DACPAC. </p>

<p>What is the correct way to change a column to not be nullable, using DACPAC and without risking data loss?</p>

<p>A nullable column was added to a table. Now I need to publish an update that sets the column to not null and sets a default. Because there are rows in the table, the update fails. There is a setting to 'allow data loss' but that isn't an option for us and this update should not result in data loss. Here's a simple example that shows the problem:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Hello]
(
    [Id] INT IDENTITY(100,1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, 
    [HelloString] NVARCHAR(50) NULL , 
    [Language] NCHAR(2) NOT NULL
)
</code></pre>

<p>Now publish that database and add rows, at least one row should have a null for HelloString.</p>

<p>Change the table definition to be:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Hello]
(
    [Id] INT IDENTITY(100,1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, 
    [HelloString] NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Hello' , 
    [Language] NCHAR(2) NOT NULL
)
</code></pre>

<p>This cannot be published. </p>

<p>Error: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rows were detected. The schema update is terminating because data loss might occur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, I tried to add a pre-deployment script to set all NULL to be 'Hello':</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE Hello SET HelloString = 'Hello' WHERE HelloString IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>This publish attempt also fails, with the same error. Looking at the <strong>auto generated</strong> publish script it is clear why, but this seems to be incorrect behavior. </p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>NOT NULL</code> alteration is applied BEFORE the default is added </li>
<li>The script checks for ANY rows, it doesn't matter whether there are
    nulls or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>The advice in the comment (To avoid this issue, you must add values to this column for all rows) doesn't solve this.</p>

<pre><code>/*
The column HelloString on table [dbo].[Hello] must be changed from NULL to NOT NULL. If the table contains data, the ALTER script may not work. To avoid this issue, you must add values to this column for all rows or mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults as a deployment option.

<p>Now, by default the app launches with tab bar ""item 0"", but when i select my tab bar for the tableview (""item 1"") it takes a few seconds to populate whilst the data is retrieved from the server.</p>

<p>Is there a way i can preload the required data for the tableview when the app is launched, that way there would be no delay when the tab bar tableview (""item 1"") is selected?</p>

<p>PS i know i can change the default tab bar item to ""item 1"" in the app delegate and this does solve the problem because the splash screen displays until the tableview is populated, but i really want tab bar ""item 0"" as the default.</p>

<p>I would expect both methods to work. However, the second <code>reverse</code> raises a <code>NoReverseMatch</code>. Examining the url patterns (by navigating to a non-existing url) shows the following url patterns:</p>

<pre><code>^demo/ ^ ^extraroute/arguments/(?P&lt;thing&gt;[^/]+)/$ [name='extraroute-arguments/(?P&lt;thing&gt;[^/]+)']

<p>I have created a simple route in camel and I want to catch fault messages from a web service as an exception with the explanation of the error.</p>

<p>The route is the following:</p>

<pre><code>    onException(Exception.class)

        .to(""log:info"")

</code></pre>

<p>In the context configuration I have this:</p>

<pre><code>context.setHandleFault(true);
</code></pre>

<p>The web service that I created for testing is as simple as this:</p>

<pre><code>@WebService
public class TestWebService {
    @WebMethod
    public double suma(double a, double b) throws Exception {
        System.out.println(""Webservice invocado!!!"");
        throw new Exception(""Mi excepcion"");
        //return a + b;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm not able to get the message from the exception ""Mi excepcion"". </p>

<p>I guess the problem comes from this line:</p>

<pre><code>2015-04-28 13:05:15 DEBUG DefaultErrorHandler:71 - Failed delivery for (MessageId: ID-saqqara-40731-1430219108400-0-3 on ExchangeId: ID-saqqara-40731-1430219108400-0-2). On delivery attempt: 0 caught: org.apache.cxf.binding.soap.SoapFault: No se ha encontrado el método de distribución de {http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/}Envelope
</code></pre>

<p>Because the caught exception is my exception policy is this one:</p>

<pre><code>Error: No se ha encontrado el método de distribución de {http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/}Envelope
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I have changed a little bit the code to log more info. This what I've done:</p>

<pre><code>onException(SoapFault.class)
    .handled(true)
    .log(""Response ON ERROR: ${body}"")
    .log(""Response ON FAULT: ${exception}"")
    .process(new FailureResponseProcessor())
    .to(""file:data/outbox?fileName=error.xml"");

from(""file:data/inbox?noop=true"")
    .id(""miRuta"")
    .log(""File content: ${body}"")
    .to(""cxf://http://localhost:8080/TestWebService?dataFormat=PAYLOAD""
      + ""&amp;properties.exceptionMessageCauseEnabled=true""
      + ""&amp;properties.faultStackTraceEnabled=true"")
    .log(""WS Response: ${body}"");
</code></pre>

<p>What I found is that when the exception is caught, the message that is logged with the following line:</p>

<pre><code>.log(""Response ON ERROR: ${body}"")
</code></pre>

<p>is this one:</p>

<pre><code>2015-04-29 09:53:28 INFO  route1:95 - Response ON ERROR:

           &lt;arg1&gt;?&lt;/arg1&gt;
        &lt;/test:suma&gt;
    &lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;
&lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When it should be the fault message, shouldn't it?.</p>

<p>Here is a brief overview of the application. I have a customer table (joined to django admin user table), products table, order table and some join tables. The customer_product table contains a pre built order form that can be edited. I use some join table to create new order_instances that can be referenced from the order table for historical data.</p>

<p><strong>` Customer has one to one relationship with user table</strong></p>

<pre><code>customer table
--------------
id


product table
-------------
id | product_id
</code></pre>

<p><strong>` Customer has and belongs to many products</strong></p>

<pre><code>customer_product (pre-built order templates)
----------------
id | customer_id | product_id
</code></pre>

<p><strong>' Customer has and belongs to many products. Customer has many orders</strong></p>

<pre><code>customer_product_order (customer initiated order)
----------------------
id | customer_id | product_id | order_id | quantity

order (main order table. each record contains meta data for that order)
-------
id | invoice_number | delivery_date

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>With regards to comments about models. I have detailed the relationships above as best as I can. The design and requirements of the app are as follow. Each customer <strong>hasone</strong> user. A customer order sheet is prebuilt by administrators and store in the customer_product table. Customer <strong>hasand belongstomany</strong> products and customer <strong>hasmanyorders</strong>. When an order is placed by the customer, a new order record is added, and the customer_products_order join table is populated, along with quantities of each product.</p>

<p><em>The customer_product table is pre-populated by administrators. The customer_product_order (join) and order table is populated by customers.</em></p>

<p>I was using the following join to grab customer information from the order model. I couldn't find any other way to recursively join the customer table from the order model. I may be wrong. Even though this is beyond this question, I really appreciate any comments on my code!</p>

We've refactored it to use a Hash and increment the counts directly through that, so this code is obsolete, but for my own sanity, I need to know why nil values show up in the packets array. The strangest thing is that it doesn't always happen, it only happens on some executions.</p>

<p>I should note that the purpose of the code is essentially to tally the number of times in a row that the random value is below p.</p>

p = 0.1

<p>The packets array should only ever contain numerical values, but it winds up with multiple nil's. What could be causing this?</p>

I see that ArrayBuffer.sorted (and sortBy) returns a new collection, and Sorting.quicksort does sort an Array in place but doesn't work on ArrayBuffers.</p>

<p>The reason I ask is that I'm using combineByKey in Spark to build collections of scored objects that are limited in size (like a ""top ten"" list by key). If I merge in a new object and the collection is already at capacity, I need to drop the lowest-scored object. I could use a sorted collection like a PriorityQueue or SortedSet, but I don't need to keep the collections sorted all the time, only in the case when a collection fills up.</p>

<p>So is there some way to sort an ArrayBuffer or ListBuffer in place? Or is there some other collection that supports appending and sorting in place? I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but I'm new to Scala.</p>

<p>Again, the pagination itself works, it just doesn't retain the form values. As I'm working with the query on the same page, I figured I could use <code>$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']</code>, but for some reason when this is in the <code>href</code> of the pagination, it either breaks the page and nothing is displayed, or generates a URL that doesn't resolve correctly—
<code>myurl.com/$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']?p=2—</code>as opposed to actually having values from <code>GET</code>.</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; l = new LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt;();
l.add(new Integer(10));
l.add(new Integer(28));
l.add(new Integer(4));

<p>The sort method works fine but simply doens't update the values of the list l in the calling class. I'm just curious as to how Collections does this, the solution would be to simply return a List from ArraySort.sort and do l = ArraySort.sort but that doesn't look as good! </p>

<p>Here is the code for the actual sorting:</p>

<pre><code>public static void sort(List l) {
    mergeSort(l);
}

private static List mergeSort(List l) {
    if (l.size() &lt;= 1) {
        return l;
    }
    List left = new LinkedList();
    List right = new LinkedList();
    int middle = l.size() / 2;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; middle; i++) {
        left.add(l.get(i));
    }
    for (int i = middle; i &lt; l.size(); i++) {
        right.add(l.get(i));
    }

    left = mergeSort(left);
    right = mergeSort(right);

    l = merge(left, right);
    return l;
}

private static List merge(List left, List right) {
    List result = new LinkedList();
    while (left.size() &gt; 0 || right.size() &gt; 0) {
        if (left.size() &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; right.size() &gt; 0) {
            if ((int) left.get(0) &lt;= (int) right.get(0)) {
                result.add(left.get(0));

The approved technique for passing by reference using call_user_func_array() seems to be by making the parameter array an array of variable references. For example, setting <code>$parameters = array( &amp;$some_variable)</code>. My question is, can we instead make the parameter array an array of variables (not references), and pass the whole parameter array as a reference instead? This is illustrated below:</p>

<pre><code>function toBeCalled( &amp;$parameter1, $parameter2 ) {
    //...Do Something...
}

$changingVar = 'passThis';
$changingVar2 = 'passThisToo';
$parameters = array( $changingVar, $changingVar2 );
call_user_func_array( 'toBeCalled', &amp;$parameters );
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the function toBeCalled expects the first variable as a reference, and the second as a value. The reason I ask is because the syntax here is convenient, and it seems to work (see this PHP 5.3 patch for the DruTex module for Drupal - <a href=""http://drupal.org/node/730940#comment-4054054"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drupal.org/node/730940#comment-4054054</a>), but I'm just checking what experts think about it.</p>

This means that you started the program, connect Ipad to power supply and it works for days, months, years etc. I was faced with the fact that whatever I do, the memory is gradually allocated, but not released. Instruments Leaks show the absence of memory leaks, but in Instruments Allocations and Activity Monitor memory is gradually allocated, it grows and grows. There are a lot of places where it occurs, particularly when playing videos

<p>This simple application does nothing more, just loop video playback. Every 3 minutes is allocated an average of 100kb. Every day - an average of 40MB. I'm profiling with Instruments Activity Monitor. Over time, the app dies.
Whats wrong? Why memory is growing, when I just watch video(loop playback) and not initialize new objects?</p>

Games will be various, from pocker to checkers. Only turn-based ones, no FPSes, RTSes, etc. But games can be really dynamic, like one turn per second.</p>

<p>So,</p>

<ul>
<li>No complex server-side logic, just validating moves, writing logs, calculating player's rating, but no AI.</li>
<li>Multichannel text chat. Push logic is highly preferred over poll.</li>
<li>UI requires no 3D graphics with fog, shaders and so on.</li>
<li>UI is highly interactive, with help tips, element highlighting, keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>It should be easy to add new game type. So pluggable UI parts are really welcome.</li>
<li>If it will not become a nightmare, I prefer to support MacOS an Linux.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I'm desiding between Silverlight and ASP.Net+AJAX. ASP.Net+AJAX seems to be much more portable (at least nothing to install), but harder to get things done. Silverlight seen to be more friendly development environment, but I'll have to be aware of Moonlight, so I cannot use any hot new Silverlight features.</p>

<p>Also, I'm experienced in server side .Net (network protocols over raw sockets, WCF, multithreading, MSSQL) and client side WinForms, but not in JavaScript or Silverlight, thus I'll have to learn something new anyway.</p>

<p>The question is - what approach/technology fits my needs best? Of cource, I'm open to suggestions of other options, I did not mention, if any.</p>

<p>I have a table containing records:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/html"" id=""myItemsTemplate""&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td data-bind=""text: MyNumber().toFixed(2)""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;button class=""btn"" data-bind=""click: $root.editItem""&gt;Edit&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;button class=""btn btn-primary"" data-bind=""click: $root.enterHours""&gt;Enter Hours&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>Initially ""MyNumber().toFixed(2)"" was just ""MyNumber"", but I was running into an issue where ""MyNumber"" wouldn't show decimal places or would show more than 2 decimal places depending on the value (if the value was ""7.00"" it would show just ""7"" and if it was ""7.345345"" it would show the full ""7.345345"").  So I changed it to ""MyNumber().toFixed(2)"".</p>

<p>That seemed to fixe the display, however now it seems that has broken the update portion:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/html"" id=""myEditTemplate""&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;input data-bind=""value: MyNumber"" class=""table-edit"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;button class=""btn btn-success"" data-bind=""click: $root.acceptItemEdit""&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;button class=""btn btn-warning"" data-bind=""click: $root.cancelItemEdit""&gt;Cancel&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, when I attempt to save the record it will save it, but will also return the error:</p>

<p>Error: Unable to parse bindings.
Message: TypeError: Object doesn't support property or method 'toFixed';
Bindings value: text: MyNumber().toFixed(2)</p>

<p>I've tried changing the edit template so it uses: 
ko.utils.unwrapObservable(MyNumber()).toFixed(2)
or
MyNumber().toFixed(2) to match the item template.  That results in no Javascript error, but also does not update the value.</p>

<p>I've seen posts saying this is because ""MyNumber"" isn't an observable so I tried unwrapObservable().  Other than that I am not sure where I should be looking to figure out what is wrong.</p>

Whenever a user clicks ""Post"" I'd like the newly generated div to just contain the timeago value from use of the plugin. 
I'm sure I'm missing something very simple but what I can't work out is why in Google Chrome and IE11 (probably other IE versions as well) the time ago value is displayed for some posts and not displayed others and it seems to be random. Please see the code below and click Post in index.php a few times in either Chrome or IE11 to see that issue I am describing.

<p>I use <code>SoftReference</code>, like many examples I've found. The problem is, when I scroll up or down in my <code>ListView</code>, the <strong>most</strong> of the images are already cleared.

That means that the <strong>most</strong> of the non-visible images in the <code>ListView</code> are gone. </p>

<p>So, everytime I <em>scroll back</em> to an earlier position (where I really downloaded images before) I have to download the images once again - they're <strong>not</strong> <em>cached</em>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if it matters but my X values range from 0 to 1000 and my Y values range from 1e-12 to 1e-16. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>So I am convinced that it is indeed just a log scale effect. For some reason though, when I plot it using <code>ax.loglog()</code> and then do <code>ax.set_yscale('linear')</code> the axis scale changes but the subplot data doesn't. When I plot it using <code>ax.plot()</code> it seems fine.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain this?</p>

<p>It 'feels' like color-theme is caching the settings somewhere and not reloading then on start-up. What am I missing?</p>

<p>Building on this, I am wishing to add more values to the array when certain conditions are met. eg </p>

<p>To summarize</p>

<p>1) Why does arr(1,1) throw me an error?</p>

<p>2) Why does Redim arr() throw me an error? (I do not want to redim to a fixed size)</p>

<p>3) Is there a way to create a dynamic 1D array in VBA?</p>

<p>Note: I suppose I could declare a 1D 100 length array which I could then manipulate to work out the number of filled values in it and redim it as (0 to 100), but first wish to explore if there are any answers to my above questions.</p>

<p>Basically there is a <code>Bus</code> model and it has a <code>seats</code> attribute</p>

<pre><code>class Bus &lt; ActiveRecord::Base

end
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have a JavaScript frontend which POST's JSON for new buses to the <code>buses#create</code> action.</p>

<p>ActiveRecord keeps encountering an error when I try to create a bus:</p>

<pre><code>: POST www.busables.com/buses dyno=web.1 queue=0 wait=5ms service=65ms status=500 bytes=728

: ActiveRecord::UnknownAttributeError (unknown attribute: seats):
:   app/controllers/buses_controller.rb:31:in `new'
:   app/controllers/buses_controller.rb:31:in `create'
</code></pre>

<p>The parameters are reaching the controller action fine. I can log them and I get the folowing:</p>

<pre><code>The bus parameters received: {""seats""=&gt;""24"", ""departure_time(1i)""=&gt;""2011"", ""departure_time(2i)""=&gt;""11"", ""departure_time(3i)""=&gt;""25"", ""departure_time(4i)""=&gt;""16"", ""departure_time(5i)""=&gt;""15"", ""route_attributes""=&gt;{""summary""=&gt;""N51"", ""beginning_address""=&gt;""A place"", ""terminal_address""=&gt;""Another place"", ""distance""=&gt;26362, ""duration""=&gt;1753}}
</code></pre>

<p>I checked that the <code>Bus</code> table actually has the <code>seats</code> column and it does (I ran this in the Heroku console):</p>

<pre><code>&gt; Bus.column_names
=&gt; [""id"", ""name"", ""route_id"", ""created_at"", ""updated_at"", ""price"", ""departure_time"", ""trip_distance"", ""trip_duration"", ""seats""]

<p>And of course I've tried migrating and loading the database schema. I've checked that the <code>attr_accessible :seats</code> is set correctly also.</p>

<p>Any other ideas?</p>

Sometimes my coworkers are unable to see icon fonts (generated by icomoon, by the way) on their IE9 even though I can. And now it seems to have switched - coworkers can see them and I can't. I powered up my laptop with IE8 natively installed and older versions of our site show the icons that won't show on my IE9 machine. The newer version of our site won't show icons on either.</p>

<p>I'm ready to write an IE9 stylesheet just removing icons fonts altogether, because for users who can't see the fonts, IE still puts that extra 15px~ of left padding that looks off.</p>

<p>We are integrating third party email solution into our site. When a user goes to the <code>Mail</code> page it must be automatically authenticated at the <code>Mail</code> site. </p>

<p>For now, the <code>Mail</code> link points to our page which automatically submits a form with the user's login and password. After clicking <code>submit</code> the user is redirected to the <code>Mail</code> site with authentication cookie.</p>

<p>The problem with this approach is that we do not want the user to see his <code>Mail</code> password, because we generate it automatically for him and there are some sane reasons not to show it.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>Is there any way to receive mail authentication cookies without sending the login information to the client and performing <code>form.submit</code> operation from the client's browser? Is there a better way to do what I'm trying to do?</p>

<h3>Edit</h3>

<p>Of course ""I am trying to do it programatically"". Looks like that there are no sane solution except pass these login/password to the client. Looks like we must accept that user can see his mail password and somehow make sure he cannot use this information to change password to some other value we will not know.</p>

The idea is the user call this routine, passing the variable where it wants to store the data, and the routine to define the conversion based on the variable/argument type.</p>

<p>An excerpt of this routine is here:</p>

<pre><code>subroutine GetAsScalar (this, value, status)
    !Arguments-------------------------------------------------------------
    class(TKeyword)                                 ::  this

    integer                                         ::  stat        

    !----------------------------------------------------------------------  

    stat = 0

    select type (value)
    type is (REAL(real32))      !single precision
        read (this%fValue, *, IOSTAT = stat) value           
    type is (REAL(real64))      !double precision
        read (this%fValue, *, IOSTAT = stat) value
    type is (LOGICAL)
        read (this%fValue, *, IOSTAT = stat) value
    type is (INTEGER(int32))    !integer
        read (this%fValue, *, IOSTAT = stat) value
    type is (INTEGER(int64))    !long integer
        read (this%fValue, *, IOSTAT = stat) value
    type is (CHARACTER(*))
        value = this%fValue
    class default            
        this%Message = ""Invalid data type""
        status = .false.
        return
    end select

    if (present (status)) then
        if (stat /= 0) then
            status = .false.
        else                    
            status = .true.
        endif
    endif

end subroutine GetAsScalar
</code></pre>

<p>""this%fValue"" is a ""character(len=:), allocatable"" string.
When I try to use this routine passing an allocatable string, it exit with success, no error/exceptions raise:</p>

<pre><code>character(len=:), allocatable :: value
call keyword%GetAsScalar(value)
</code></pre>

<p>But the string ""value"" is always empty.
Even inside the routine, after the assign ""value = this%fValue"", value is empty (len(value) is 0).</p>

<p>It seems that the compiler is unable to detected that the argument is of type character(len=:), allocatable, and so, is unable to assign the value to it.</p>

<p>Of course I have some alternatives, but the idea of being able to use a single rountine and without optional arguments for different kind of data is really nice.</p>

<p>I can use a user defined type that I create to handle strings, for example.</p>

<p>But I would like to know if this is the default behaviour in Fortran 2008.
And also, if there is a way to accomplish this, using this routine, with a single ""class(*)"" dummy argumment, to convert different types including the referred allocatable character. There is a way to force the allocation inside the routine, for example?</p>

<p>I'll appreciate your comments.
Cheers,
Eduardo</p>

<p>I have a good knowledge of Java threading, but I liked .NET's <code>BeginInvoke</code> and <code>EndInvoke</code> methods because they allowed me to switch from synchronous to asynchronous tasks with ease.</p>

<p>In my case, if I have a set of I/O intensive operations (suitable for changing to async) like the following:</p>

<pre><code>DoOperation1();

BeginInvoke(DoOperation2);
BeginInvoke(DoOperation3);
EndInvoke(Result1);
EndInvoke(Result2);
EndInvoke(Result3);

We're using <a href=""https://github.com/siasia/xsbt-web-plugin"" rel=""nofollow"">xsbt web plugin</a> as well. There's a ""core"" project, which contains the vast majority of the functionality; my current goal is to create two ""distribution"" projects that add a different set of classpath resources to the ""core"" project. The problem is that I either 1) can't get the ""distribution"" projects to run, or 2) Get them to run, but the required resource doesn't seem to be there.</p>

<p><strong>What I've tried</strong></p>

<p>Here's an abridged version of my <code>project/Build.scala</code>:</p>

<pre><code>lazy val core = Project(""Core"", file(""core""))
  .settings( /*some dependencies, resolvers, webSettings */ )

lazy val app1 = Project(""App1"", file(""app1""))
  .aggregate(core)
  .settings( /*the same settings as core */ )

lazy val app2 = Project(""App2"", file(""app2""))
  .aggregate(core)
  .settings( /*the same settings as core*/ )
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the directory structure for both <code>app1</code> and <code>app2</code>, I have a file at <code>src/main/resources/aFileINeed</code>. The core application is using the <code>class.getResource</code> approach to load the file from the classpath.</p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>

<p>If I try to run one of the distribution projects, using <code>container:start</code>, it does not detect the required file in the classpath. Also, it claims that <code>src/main/webapp</code> is not an existing directory (that folder is included in the core project, as it is required by the xsbt web plugin).</p>

<p><strong>How can I get these projects to ""merge"" their resources?</strong> I expected that using <code>aggregate</code> or <code>dependsOn</code> in the <code>Build.scala</code> project definition would handle that for me, but it apparently doesn't.</p>

<p>Can anybody help me get started? (aside or addition to what I've already got). I also don't know how to go from elements of an array to elements of a node and how to sort them in order.

<p>Per <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/architecture/aa479086"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/architecture/aa479086</a>, Tenant View Filter is described as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""SQL views can be used to grant individual tenants access to some of the rows in a given table, while preventing them from accessing other rows.</p>
  
  <p>In SQL, a view is a virtual table defined by the results of a SELECT query. The resulting view can then be queried and used in stored procedures as if it were an actual database table. For example, the following SQL statement creates a view of a table called Employees, which has been filtered so that only the rows belonging to a single tenant are visible:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>CREATE VIEW TenantEmployees AS 
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE TenantID = SUSER_SID()
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>This statement obtains the security identifier (SID) of the user account accessing the database (which, you'll recall, is an account belonging to the tenant, not the end user) and uses it to determine which rows should be included in the view""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thinking this through , if we have one database storing say 5,000 different tenants, then the connection pool is completely fragmented and every time a request is sent to the database ADO.NET needs to establish a new connection and authenticate (remember connection pooling works for each unique connection string) and this approach means you have 5,000 connection strings…</p>

<p>How worried should I be about this? Can someone give me some real world examples of how significant an impact the connection pool has on a busy multi-tenant database server (say servicing 100 requests per second)? Can I just throw more hardware at the problem and it goes away?</p>

<p>Thoughts ??</p>

<p>Obviously not quite what I was going for as the keyframe animations still contain the skew functions and not the values returned by the skew functions. I believe the problem may be that I'm trying to pass other mixins from LESShat inside of the string. So, is there some manner of concatenating strings and mixin functions in LESS? Keep in mind, I'm a total NEWB to LESS. I would simply rather not have to write my own cross-browser transforms. It'd me cool if it could all be automated using LESS. I'm obviously doing it wrong.</p>

<p>The following link describes the .keyframes and .skew functions from LESShat, but I see nothing regarding the mixing of the two mentioned. Maybe I somehow missed that part.

<p>For instance if I am in LA and the time is 7:00 PM will it store the comment at 7PM and say that I am from New York obviously and I see the comment its 10 PM so what time will I see the 7PM that wouldnt really make sense. I am wondering how you solve this problem and differentiate between different time-zones. </p>

<p>I am imagining that the server has its own time zone associated with it so all time is delineated from that which would make things a whole lot easier. But is it right that a person sees their time from a post as 10PM when it was made at 7PM.  This is all very confusing to me.  Any information on how to regularly deal with this issue or if I have one at all will be greatly appreciated. I am building my site using PHP and Codeigniter. </p>

<p>I have the basics working.  I can add a customer, job, estimate and invoice and run queries against them.</p>

<p>But I can't link an invoice to an estimate (to keep track of progress invoicing).  If I try to add the estimate TxnID as a <code>LinkToTxnID</code>, when I submit the request I get the error message 3210 - <code>Object ""25-1376628895"" specified in the request cannot be found</code>.</p>

<p>However, before it even shows the form, it gives me an error:</p>

<pre><code>Missing Database Table

</code></pre>

<p>Which is correct, there is no database table for office_layouts. But it's not needed. That's why there is no table. The form is just uploaded to the server.</p>

<p>I have read through creating forms, and have tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>// file: View/OfficeLayout/upload.ctp
echo $this-&gt;Form-&gt;create( null ,array('type' =&gt; 'file')); ?&gt;

    ?&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;
&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;Form-&gt;end(__('Submit')); ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As well as chaning the <code>null</code> to the controller name (in this case <code>OfficeLayout</code>). I have also removed all parameters (<code>thus creating it like so: $this-&gt;Form-&gt;create()</code>)</p>

<p>In my controller I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>public function upload($branch = null) {
    $this-&gt;set('branch',$branch);
    if(isset($this-&gt;request-&gt;data['OfficeLayout'])) {
        $file = $this-&gt;request-&gt;data['OfficeLayout']['layout'];
        if($file['error'] === UPLOAD_ERR_OK &amp;&amp; move_uploaded_file($file['tmp_name'],APP . 'docs' . DS . 'layouts' . DS . $branch . '.pdf')) {
            $this-&gt;Session-&gt;setFlash('New layout successfully uploaded.','default',array('class'=&gt;'notification'));

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This action get's called with: <code>domain/office_layouts/upload/branch</code>.</p>

<p>Whenever I remove the <code>$this-&gt;Form-&gt;create()</code> line, it shows the upload view, but then obviously doesn't submit.</p>

<p>What appears to be happening is when the view controller gets instantiated and pushed on top of the navigation controller's stack, my <code>studentsSearch</code> array is <code>nil</code>. I populate it within that controller. </p>

<p>So upon initialization, the cell has its font set to Georgia with a size of 14 because the <code>count</code> is &lt; 0. However, once I populate the <code>studentsSearch</code> array and reload the <code>tableView</code>'s data, the font seems to be sticking from when the view first got initialized.</p>

<p>I suppose now I need to find how to set the font back to that cell to what the default is.</p>

<p>My regex search finds the first one, returns the location and I replace it, I then cycle through the document until my regex search doesnt find any - i.e its array of match dimensions is empty. </p>

<p>The problem is for some reason it continues to match on ""i dont exactly know what"". I.e the length of the array returned from the regex search is never 0</p>

<pre><code>location := split[:locationSplit]

bodyRe := regexp.MustCompile(`!\[(.*)\]\((.*)\)`)
indexes := bodyRe.FindStringIndex(body)
fmt.Println(""location: "", absoluteFileLocation)
fmt.Println(""length: "", indexes)

for len(indexes) != 0 {
    fmt.Println(""length: "", len(indexes))
    imageLocation := body[indexes[0]:indexes[1]]
    body = body[:indexes[0]] + imageLocation + body[indexes[1]:]
    indexes = indexes[:0]
    fmt.Println(""length: "", len(indexes))
    indexes = bodyRe.FindStringIndex(body)
}
</code></pre>

<p>this returns a continual:</p>

<pre><code>length:  2
length:  0
length:  2
length:  0
length:  2
length:  0
length:  2
length:  0
length:  2
</code></pre>

<p>the 2's come from the line <code>indexes = bodyRe.FindStringIndex(body)</code> inside the loop as I set indexes to 0 just before.</p>

<p>Help appreciated</p>

<p>EDIT: Edit due to request for example included. The above method is clearly flawed, this following method works for the first image, but not for the next ones</p>

<p>So I attempted this technique:</p>

<p>(sample markdown file)</p>

<pre><code>some markdown

![image](anImage.png)

more markdown

![image2](anImage2.png)

more markdown &amp; end of document
</code></pre>

<p>and the the revised code:</p>

<pre><code>...
...
    bodyRe := regexp.MustCompile(`!\[(.*)\]\((.*)\)`)
    indexes := bodyRe.FindAllStringSubmatchIndex(body, -1)

    for _, j := range(indexes) { //i is the index, j is the element (in this case j = []int )
        imageLocation := body[j[4]:j[5]]
        body = body[:j[4]] + ""/App/Image/?image="" + location + ""/"" + imageLocation + body[j[5]:]
    }
    return body
</code></pre>

<p>(required output markdown)</p>

<pre><code>some markdown

![image](/App/Image/?image=[location]/anImage.png)

more markdown

![image2](/App/Image/?image=[location]/anImage2.png)

more markdown
end of document
</code></pre>

<p>And that works for the first image. But not the second one. The problem is (I think that when that method loops through and replaces the first one, the indexes in body (i.e <code>body[j[4]:j[5]]</code>) change and so it replaces the second one in the wrong place.</p>

<p>I need to do this so that when the markdown is eventually rendered the image urls point to places where they can be served from.</p>

<p>EDIT: Fixed</p>

<p>Thanks guys.
Due to the fact that people struggled to understand what I wanted to do, I suspect that I am going about the problem in a strange way. I have got it working and below is the code snippet that works for any one else looking into this.</p>

<p>Firstly I will explain why I had the problem.
I wanted to seperate out the writing of blogs for a site, from the actual maintenance of the site itself. Therefore 'blog writers' were told to write blogs in markdown, with all image tags in the format of ` where all images must be in the same directory as the markdown file itself.
Because this directory is not part of the code base of the website itself, the image urls needed replacing with the absolute urls so they could be served. I didnt want this to be something the blog writers needed to worry about.</p>

<p>Everything worked fine for the first image, but because the replacement absolute URL changed the length and therefore the positions of all of the characters in the blog contents, the indexes that the regex found, no longer aligned, so I had to add the new length to the indexes of matches.</p>

<pre><code>adjustment := 0
for _, j := range(indexes) {
    imageLocation := body[j[4]+adjustment:j[5]+adjustment]

    replacement := ""?imageurl="" + url.QueryEscape(location) + ""/"" + imageLocation
    body = body[:j[4] + adjustment] + replacement + body[j[5] + adjustment:]
    adjustment += len(replacement) - len(imageLocation)
}

<p>In other words, I need the name and (position) separated out into separate columns, but they still need to align by row.  Is this possible in a RadioButtonList?</p>

<p>I've tried making them into individual RadioButton objects, but after doing so, I started getting the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Control 'ctl00$Content$ChicagoCubsInfield_0' referenced by the ControlToValidate property of '' cannot be validated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried messing around with validation (including setting the CausesValidation property to ""False""), all to no avail.</p>

<p>Note: I am not as concerned about the validation error as much as I am about the table rendering; that is more important (unless, that is, fixing the validation error helps fix the rendering issue).</p>

<p>What would be the best way to tackle this?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance . . .</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I was able to recreate what I wanted by using straight client-side &lt;input> tags, but this is not ideal.  I would much prefer using server-side &lt;asp:RadioButton>.</p>

<p>I've been doing some digging, and it appears that the reason why my RadioButton tags are failing validation is because of the ct100 prefixes that are concatenated to the beginning of the ID/Name tags.  When the page is working (with the RadioButtonList) the IDs for each ListItem seems to have a ""ct100_Content_"" prefix, but the name has a ""ct100$Content$"" prefix.</p>

<p>The error I'm getting (when trying to use individual RadioButtons) is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Control 'ctl00$Content$ChicagoCubsInfield_0' referenced by the ControlToValidate property of '' cannot be validated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strike>From what I'm seeing, I <em>think</em> the control is looking for ""ctl00_Content_ChicagoCubsInfield_0"" (note the ""_"" instead of the ""$"").</p>

<p>How do I force the ID to use the underscores instead of dollar signs?  I need to keep it local to these tags, as I believe settings are used elsewhere (again, this is not my form), and I don't want to break anything else.</strike></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> So much for that theory.  I came across the ""ClientIDMode"" attribute, set it to ""Static"", and explicitly set my IDs.  No dice.  The digging continues . . .</p>

<p>I am currently using a bitmap to draw the falling flower. I started making a class for the flower object instead, which so far looks like this</p>

<pre><code>    public class Blossom{
    private Bitmap blossom;

    public Blossom()
    {
        Bitmap blossom = 
            (BitmapFactory.decodeResource
                    (getResources(), R.drawable.blossom));
    }
    public void setImage(Bitmap bitmap)
    {
        //sets the image for the blossom;
        Bitmap blossom = bitmap;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It keeps giving me an error saying getResources is undefined for the Blossom class. When I try to write a method called setImage, and do the setting of the Image in the BoardView class, it won't let me at all :( It looked something like this</p>

<pre><code>    public class Blossom{
    private Bitmap blossom;

    public void setImage(Bitmap bitmap)
    {
        //sets the image for the blossom;
        Bitmap blossom = bitmap;
    }
}

My requirement is very simple. I need CLI for most of the applications I write. And for each of them, I don't want to write an app-specific shell. But instead, if I have a shell framework  using which I can create my commands and add them to the shell, it would be very helpful.</p>

<p>Custom command would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class MyCommand implements ShellCommand{

        @Override
        public void run(){
                // application logic goes here

                return ""shows all files in the directory.. blah blah"";

In my <code>TableViewController</code>, in the <code>didSelectRow</code> method I'm setting my <code>viewControlle</code>r's <code>detailItem</code> to the thing selected, however it isn't registering and instead <code>detailItem</code> comes out as null.</p>

/*
 When a row is selected, set the detail view controller's detail item to the item associated with the selected row.
 */
affirmaPDFViewController.detailItem = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@"", [listOfPDF objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]];
affirmaPDFViewController.i = indexPath.row;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is what is in my <code>detailViewController</code> this what is supposed to be called when detailItem is assigned to a new value.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)setDetailItem:(id)newDetailItem {
NSInteger start = 0;


if (detailItem != newDetailItem) {
    [detailItem release];
    detailItem = [newDetailItem retain];

    // Update the view.
    [self configureView];

    start = ((i) * 768);
    scrollView.contentOffset = CGPointMake(webView1.frame.origin.x + start, webView1.frame.origin.y);
    counter = start / 768;
}

if (popoverController != nil) {
    [popoverController dismissPopoverAnimated:YES];
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my <code>TableViewController.h</code> file I have:</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;

@class AffirmaPDFViewController;

@interface PDFTableController : UITableViewController {
    AffirmaPDFViewController *affirmaPDFViewController;
    NSMutableArray *listOfPDF;
}

@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet AffirmaPDFViewController *affirmaPDFViewController;

@property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableArray *listOfPDF;

<p>and in the implementation file I'm synthesizing the affirmaPDFViewController.</p>

<p>Any ideas as to why setDetailItem isn't being called?</p>

<p>I've rechecked many times directories owner (user and group - chown, chgrp), have change folder attributes to unsecure 777 (rwx with <code>chmod</code>), but it has no effect. I even reinstalled an Apache and PHP, but still was facing the same error.</p>

<p>As it is appeared after hours of reading various documentation the origin of error was SELinux restrictions automatically applied for Apache service httpd. I've simply turned off the SELinux by editing <code>/etc/selinux/config</code> file on my Fedora (release 20) via changing line:</p>

<pre><code>SELINUX=enforcing
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>SELINUX=disabled
</code></pre>

<p>I restarted my computer and that annoying error had finally dissapeared.</p>

<p>I have to notice that all the questions at Stack Overflow regarding the issue of ""permission denied"" on LAMP environment were touching only the folder permission concerns which was not the case in my case.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>(<em>practical</em>) How can I grant Apache httpd service write-delete-update permissions on directory without totally disabling SELinux?</p></li>
<li><p>(<em>theoretical</em>) What is the SELinux? What it is intended for? Why (for what reason) it was created? Why should I use it? Is there a reason to keep SElinux enabled on local dev machine?</p></li>

<p><em>solely to moderators of the resource: I know that this issue covers more administrating than actual programming, but I'm sure it affects developers in much more severe way than say novice administrators, so choosing between SuperUser and StackOverflow I took the latter.

<p>Here's what I've tried so far:</p>

<p>I am able to load .bmp's and .jpg's as custom images without any problem.  I can load .gif's, but it doesn't seem to preserve the transparency.  I can't load .png's at all.  I'd really like to use .png's to take advantage of the alpha-blending that is not available in the other formats.</p>

<p>I found a similar <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3868758/ms-access-2007-load-image-to-ribbon"">question on SO</a>, but that just deals with loading custom icons of any kind.  I am specifically interested in .png's.  There is an answer from Albert Kallal to that question that links to a class module he had written that appears to do exactly what I want:</p>

<pre><code>meRib(""Button1"").Picture = ""HappyFace.png""
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, the link in that answer is dead.</p>

<p>I also found this <a href=""http://www.accessribbon.de/en/?Access_-_Ribbons%3aUser_Defined_Icons___Pictures_In_Ribbon_Controls"" rel=""nofollow"">site</a> which offers a download of a 460 line module full of dozens of API calls to get support for transparent icons.  Before I go that route I wanted to ask the experts here if they know of a better way.  </p>

<p>I know .png is pretty new-fangled and all, but I'm hoping the Office development folks slipped in some native support for the format.</p>

<p>Basically I want to keep all the same functionality, the only difference is that when the suggestion box appears, I don't the suggestion box to hide when a user makes a selection and I also don't want that selection to populate the input box that .autocomplete is attached to.</p>

<p>So, I've been reading through the jQuery UI documentation, and it appears there is a way to disable the Select: and Close: events, but I find the way they have explained it to be very confusing and hence, this is why I'm here asking for help.</p>

<p><strong>My jQuery</strong></p>

<pre><code>$( ""#comment"" ).autocomplete({
    source: ""comments.php"",
    minLength: 4,

    // Attempt to remove click/select functionality - may be a better way to do this        
    select: function( event, ui ) {
        return false;
    },
    // Attempt to add custom Class to the open Suggestion box - may be a better way
    open : function (event, ui) {
        $(this).addClass(""suggestion-box"");
    },
    // Attempt to cancel the Close event, so when someone makes a selection, the box does not close
    close : function (event, ui) {
        return false;   
    }
});

<p><strong>Official jQuery UI documentation</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Triggered when an item is selected from the menu; ui.item refers to the selected item.
  The default action of select is to replace the text field's value with the value of the 
  selected item. Canceling this event prevents the value from being updated, but does not
  prevent the menu from closing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Code examples</p>

<pre><code>Supply a callback function to handle the select event as an init option.
$( "".selector"" ).autocomplete({
   select: function(event, ui) { ... }
});
Bind to the select event by type: autocompleteselect.
$( "".selector"" ).bind( ""autocompleteselect"", function(event, ui) {
  ...
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Confusion</strong></p>

<p>What confuses me is that they seem to be suggesting to remove the .autocomplete and replace with .bind(""autocompleteselect"") - which will disable the autocomplete altogether?</p>

<p>This same unexpected redirection is happening elsewhere in the site. I am hoping if I can isolate the issue here I can fix the other instances.</p>

<p>Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

    session_start();
    ob_start;

<p>click the link for the funny text problem on SharePoint page content</p>

<p>ALL same problem on the following browsers -> IE, Chrome, and firefox
Our SharePoint Site works fine except for some users....
This SharePoint Site that displays funny text happens to some users only..
Related Symptoms on these problem...
symptom 1 -> Page does exist - after going back to home page and clicking back again to the subsite the pages will be displayed properly and the white page does not exist is gone...
symptom 2 -> after repeating the same testing home page to subsite.... subsite to home page.... the problem will now display the funny text like the image i have attached...
symptom 3 -> All InfoPath forms cannot be open keeps on loading like the endless circling gif</p>

<p>Initial Solution for some users: CHKDSK /R on the Command prompt and restart  = we did the checkdisk repair for the pc/laptop and the problem is gone...</p>

<p>But for some user the Checkdisk repair did not solve the problem....
We already did a repair also for the MS office... and Java Update but the problem was not solve.....</p>

<p>How start debugging from here...? and how to ask google about this problem also.... I can only describe it as a funny text or SharePoint Page Content is not displaying properly...
What do I search and find if I will investigate on the SharePoint logs.....?
If it is a javascript problem how do I repair it?</p>

<hr>

<p>Here is the controller:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class StaffController extends AppController{
    function test(){
        $this-&gt;data = $this-&gt;Staff-&gt;find( 'list' );
    }

<pre><code>&lt;pre&gt;
Count: &lt;?php echo count( $this-&gt;data ) . ""\n""; ?&gt;
Empty: &lt;?php echo ( empty( $this-&gt;data ) ? 'true' : 'false' ) . ""\n""; ?&gt;
Count: &lt;?php echo count( $this-&gt;data ) . ""\n""; ?&gt;
&lt;?php var_dump( $this-&gt;data ) ?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the rendered output:</p>

<pre><code>Count: 2
Empty: true
Count: 2
array(2) {
  [1]=&gt;
  string(12) ""Mock Staff 1""
  [2]=&gt;
  string(12) ""Mock Staff 2""
}
</code></pre>

<p>Why would <code>empty()</code> return True when both <code>count()</code> and <code>debug()</code> show that a non-empty value has been assigned?</p>

<p>Is this a CakePHP bug?  A PHP bug?  ???</p>

<p>If I use another variable instead of $this->data :</p>

<pre><code>function test(){
    $this-&gt;set( 'data', $this-&gt;Staff-&gt;find( 'list' ) );
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the view:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pre&gt;
Count: &lt;?php echo count( $data ) . ""\n""; ?&gt;
Empty: &lt;?php echo ( empty( $data ) ? 'true' : 'false' ) . ""\n""; ?&gt;
Count: &lt;?php echo count( $data ) . ""\n""; ?&gt;
&lt;?php var_dump( $data ) ?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>it works as expected:</p>

<pre><code>Count: 2
Empty: false
Count: 2
array(2) {
  [1]=&gt;
  string(12) ""Mock Staff 1""
  [2]=&gt;
  string(12) ""Mock Staff 2""
}

<p>Problem occurred, when <code>User</code> is updated with new <code>Person</code> data.</p>

<p>New Person id generated and <strong>one new row inserted</strong> into Person table.</p>

<p>How to do that,<code>Person</code> appropriate row <strong>to be updated</strong> and not inserted?</p>

<p>Thank you for help.</p>

<p><strong>Assumption:</strong><br></p>

<p>I assume,that problem is in autoincrementing <code>id</code>s when refer to the entity.<br>
It looks like, autoincrementing should be avoided in case of <code>update</code> or <code>saveOrUpdate</code> method calls.<br>
Autoincrementing should be called,when entity firstly created and inserted into DB.</p>

<p>I have many Manager objects that produce and manage ResultSets that are built on top of some of the application base classes.</p>

<p>Any ideas would be great.  I am trying not to refactor old deep code as much as possible.</p>

<p>CityManager is something like </p>

<pre><code>   ImAFilterSetManager&lt;ImAFilterSetBase&lt;CityBase&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and ChainManger is something like</p>

<pre><code>   ImAFilterSetManager&lt;ImAFilterSetBase&lt;ChainBase&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Manager executes the Initialize and returns a ImAFilterSetBase and wires the handler.  </p>

<p>Is there a way to cast to something like below?</p>

<pre><code>ImAFilterSetManager&lt;ImAFilterSetBase&lt;object&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Execution code </p>

<pre><code>      List&lt;object&gt; filters = new List&lt;object&gt;() { 
                        new CityManager(),
                        new ChainManager(), }

        //(XXXX as  object fails)
        foreach (ImAFilterSetManager&lt;ImAFilterSetBase&lt;XXXX&gt;&gt; filter in filters) 
        {
               var newFilter = filter.Initialize(_Client);

               filter.OnResultsChanged += filterResults_Handler;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>It does seem if use dyanmic i can Initialize (or at least it compliles and runs, havent tried much else) but I'm a little worried that would be bad form or cause side effects.</p>

<pre><code>foreach (dynamic filter in filters) 
{           
    var newFilter = filter.Initialize(_Client);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Interfaces for reference ( generic  I is a ImAFilterSetBase(CityBase) and generic C would be CityBase or ChainBase class )</p>

<pre><code>public interface ImAFilterSetManager&lt;I&gt;
        {
                event EventHandler&lt;ResultSetArgs&gt; OnResultsChanged;

                I Initialize(IClient client);

<p>In the GruntJs file, every other ""task"" gets the path relative to the ""base"" or ""project root"" by default. That's great. But, how do I get the same ( base / project root ) value passed to the Zetzer's env paths ( path_img, path_js, path_css ). These are used in doT files  ( .dot.htm )</p>

<p>When the ( .htm after grunting ) file is called, these path are produced relative to the html file itself. </p>

<p>Is there someway to include the project root to the path. ( without manually typing it in )</p>

"30307136","1","","","2015-05-18 15:25:07","","0","94","<p>I need to create a chart to show coverage by different people over time.  For example, a scatter chart with no markers showing with one series for each time period that someone will be available.  Each person has a different Y value (e.g. Joe=1, Pat=2, Kevin=3).  The purpose is to visualize gaps in coverage where time is the X axis.</p>

<p>I’ve found how to add each series through…</p>

<pre><code>    ActiveChart.SeriesCollection.NewSeries
    ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(1).XValues = “=Sheet1!$A$1:$B$1”
    ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(1).Values = “=Sheet1!$C$1:$D$1”
    ActiveChart.SeriesCollection.NewSeries
    ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(2).XValues = “=Sheet1!$A$2:$B$2”
    ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(2).Values = “=Sheet1!$C$2:$D$2”
</code></pre>

<p>…and so on, but that code was generated by manually assigning X and Y values.</p>

<p>What I need to do is:</p>

<p>1) have all the X and Y values brought in (plotted on the chart) dynamically based on the number of rows on the worksheet (the number of rows will not always be the same), and</p>

<p>2) format all the series with the same Y value in the same way (e.g. all series where Y=2 are red lines, and all series where Y=1 are blue lines).</p>

<p>I was thinking that I could use a loop using i for iteration/row number until there's an empty cell, but I've been unable to make that work in this instance.</p>

<p>The next step is being able to add data from multiple worksheets on the same chart.  I found some code that went like this...</p>

<pre><code>    Dim ws As String
    For Each ws in ThisWorkbook
</code></pre>

<p>Will that take data from all worksheets?</p>

<p>I'd like to post an example of what I'm trying to do, but apparently I need rep first.  Here is a link.  The only difference is that I want everything on the same line to be the same color (i.e. on the graph with only 2 objects in the legend).
<a href=""http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk185/navytoolmanshortfieldbreak/Graph%20Problem%201_zpszxpsgikn.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk185/navytoolmanshortfieldbreak/Graph%20Problem%201_zpszxpsgikn.jpg</a></p>

<p>Update:  If you can't get to the photo, there are 4 rows and 4 columns of data.  Each row contains a series that should be plotted as a horizontal line.  The first two columns are the X coords, while the last two columns are the Y coords.  The first row shows a line from 1,1 to 3,1, the second row from 5,1 to 7,1, etc.</p>

                ""failLog"",
                messageSource.getMessage(""login.user.fail"", new String[] {
                        ""  "", """" }, request.getLocale()));
</code></pre>

   --&gt; same structure but with several repetitions of Position 7 and 8.

   &lt;/City&gt;
 &lt;/TB&gt;
&lt;/Main&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What I need is to group the <code>Block</code>s and <code>House</code>s which are under the same position and remove the repetition of Position numbers. For example it will get like this:</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;City&gt;
     &lt;Area&gt;
       &lt;Position&gt;5&lt;/Position&gt;
       &lt;House&gt;

       --&gt; some elements and stuff

       &lt;/Block&gt;
     &lt;/Area&gt;
     &lt;Area&gt;
       &lt;Position&gt;6&lt;/Position&gt;
       &lt;House&gt;

       --&gt; some elements and stuff

       &lt;/Block&gt;

   &lt;/City&gt;
   &lt;City&gt;

   --&gt; same structure for Position 7 and 8.

   &lt;/City&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It's harder because the Position is not an attribute of the Area, so I basically have to identify the value of the Position of the Area, then grab the House and Block that fall under the same Position, and put them together surrounded by the same <code>&lt;Area&gt; &lt;/Area&gt;</code>.</p>

Basically you would look down Z axis onto X-Y plane. From this <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>LINK</strong></a><br>
""<em>For three-dimensional systems, a convention is to portray the x–y plane horizontally, with the z axis added to represent height (positive up). Furthermore, there is a convention to orient the x-axis toward the viewer, biased either to the right or left</em>""</p>

<p>So why does Unity treat Y as the ""up"" axis? that is a perspective axis, right? Seems to be the trend in the gaming world, but not from the math perspective.</p>

<p>I realize that in a 3d world perspective is not absolute, but what is the reason to look down the Y axis? Shouldn't 3d world be consistent with 2d world and keep X Y working coordinates with Z being a perspective axis?</p>

<p>The only possible answer I got from wiki: ""<em>However, computer graphics and image processing often use a coordinate system with the y axis oriented downwards on the computer display. This convention developed in the 1960s (or earlier) from the way that images were originally stored in display buffers.</em>"". However, I don't understand this answer, it seems too weak to break the standard and flip everything around.</p>

<p>Appreciate any insight.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The reason i am asking is I am developing a 3d game with a friend of mine and we need to decide which axis to use as a perspective axis. Per geometry, we should use Z axis looking down onto X Y plane.Per unity and alot (most?) of gaming standards we should use Y axis looking down X Z plane.</p>

<p>I presume this means that there are some missing dependencies, but I can't run pub install because I'm behind a corporate http proxy:</p>

<pre><code>Running pub install ...
Pub install failed, [1] Resolving dependencies...
Timed out trying to find package ""web_ui 0.2.8+6"" at http://pub.dartlang.org.
</code></pre>

<p>Hence, I started looking for a temporary workaround for pub dependency resolution. I tried changing the pubspec.yaml to go through the git:// protocol instead of http (which won't resolve without going through the proxy):</p>

<pre><code>name: dart_chat
description: This is a chat app written in Dart using the Dart Web UI package

dependencies:
  web_ui:
    git: git://github.com/dart-lang/web-ui.git
</code></pre>

<p>I get further than before with pub install, so I think it successfully went through the git protocol and is trying to resolve web_ui's dependencies, but unfortunately doing so fails on web_ui's dependency for logging (which looks like it's still going through http://):</p>

<pre><code>Running pub install ...
Pub install failed, [1] Resolving dependencies...
Timed out trying to find package ""logging 0.2.7"" at http://pub.dartlang.org.
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like I can't change the yaml to use the sdk's logging dependency either:</p>

<pre><code>logging:
    sdk: logging
</code></pre>

<p>because that's an incompatible source with web_ui:</p>

<pre><code>Pub install failed, [1] Resolving dependencies...
Incompatible dependencies on 'logging':
- 'dart_chat' depends on it from source 'sdk'
- 'web_ui' depends on it from source 'hosted'
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any other way to get around this proxy issue with the current dev tools? Could I mirror pub.dartlang.org somehow? Or mirror the git repositories for each dependency? Thanks.</p>

However that file is marked crossed which indicates that the bar file contains an error.  I don't know how to debug the error.

The connection to the local database always work properly, this is my configuration:  </p>

<pre><code> production:

  encoding: utf8
  database: xxx
  username: yyy
  password: zzz
  host: x.x.x.x
  port: 3306

<p>But connections to remote databases often return an error, such as connecting to my radius external database returns the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Mysql :: Error:: SELECT 1 AS one FROM WHERE `` radacct` radacct`.`username` =? LIMIT 1
</code></pre>

<p>Updating the page several times, the connection is restored and I can see the data properly. This is my configuration:</p>

<pre><code> radius:
  port: 3306
  adapter: mysql
  encoding: utf8
  database: xxx

  read_timeout: 90
  write_timeout: 90
  checkout_timeout: 10
  reaping_frequency: 30
  dead_connection_timeout: 30
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to change the configuration of the timers in different ways, but the problem persists.</p>

<p>to connect to the radius server I created the following model common to all:</p>

<pre><code>class RadActiveRecord &lt;ActiveRecord :: Base
   self.abstract_class = true
   establish_connection ""radius""
end
</code></pre>

<p>for example for the table radacct use the following model:</p>

<pre><code>class RadAcctDetail &lt;RadActiveRecord
   self.table_name = ""radacct""
end
</code></pre>

<p>the error in question is with any queries, such as:</p>

<pre><code>def index
     @rad_acct_details = RadAcctDetail.all.paginate = (
       : order =&gt; ""radacctid DESC""
       : page =&gt; params [: page] || 1
       : per_page =&gt; params [: per_page] || 25)
end

<p>To give a broad outline of what I'm attempting essentially there is a secure web site (HTTPS) we access, which we need to check on a daily basis (it doesn't have email notification!) I would like to do a 'quick and dirty' powershell script to automate this. Essentially I would like to login to the website, save the page, and then send the page as an attachment to the required person. This works fine as a manual process.</p>

<p>Research has led me to 'curl', which I have installed. Using Chrome I have managed to copy the HTTP GET method as cURL. However, when I run this command I receive a response that 'You must enable JavaScript in your browser to use XXXX'. Can you use curl to return data from a web page which requires Javascript? Is there a better way I should go about this? </p>

[query findObjectsInBackgroundWithBlock:^(NSArray *objects, NSError *error) {

            } else {

            }

Everything says that I have to put the Portrait/Lanscape bit into the PrintDocument QueryPageSettings Event, then the PrintPreviewDialog will get the settings from the PrintDocument.</p>

<p>I started off with:</p>

<pre><code>    Private Sub PrintDocument1_QueryPageSettings(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.QueryPageSettingsEventArgs) Handles PrintDocument1.QueryPageSettings
    Select Case mOrientation
        Case ePrinterOrientation.Landscape

        Case ePrinterOrientation.Portrait
            PrintDocument1.DefaultPageSettings.Landscape = False
    End Select
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Here's my current code</p>

<pre><code>   Private Sub PrintDocument1_QueryPageSettings(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.QueryPageSettingsEventArgs) Handles PrintDocument1.QueryPageSettings
    Select Case mOrientation
        Case ePrinterOrientation.Landscape
            Dim ps As New PaperSize(""A4Landscape"", 1169, 827)
            ps.PaperName = PaperKind.A4
            PrintDocument1.DefaultPageSettings.PaperSize = ps
            PrintDocument1.DefaultPageSettings.Landscape = True
        Case ePrinterOrientation.Portrait
            Dim ps As New PaperSize(""A4Portrait"", 827, 1169)
            ps.PaperName = PaperKind.A4
            PrintDocument1.DefaultPageSettings.PaperSize = ps
            PrintDocument1.DefaultPageSettings.Landscape = False
    End Select
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried putting this code into the PrintDocument1_BeginPrint event, this did change the ""Window"" of the PrintPreview, but the contents of the PrintDocument still stayed Portrait (the width of the used ""view"", remain the same).</p>

<p>The Portrait mode spans the 10 columns over 2 pages, the Landscape mode should have all the columns on 1 page, but this is not the case, the ""PrintableArea"" margins appear to remain exactly the same in reality, even if the numbers change to the correct values if I step through debug.</p>

<p>I'm getting truely p****d off with this, this 3-way dependency, it should be simpler than this.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Further to this problem. If I PRINT the document, the orientation is set to Landscape, but the Print Margins (the Document) is still printed (with overflow) as though the margins are Portrait.</p>

<p>I REALLY need to fix this. It is NOT acceptable.</p>

<p>I am trying to use the SELECT function in a php file to run a basic report. I wrote the SQL in PHPMyAdmin and used the convert-to-php button to do just that. What I get is the following:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
l.id AS 'ID',
l.type AS 'Type',
l.state AS 'State',
l.won_at AS 'Won',
l.lost_at AS 'Lost',
l.cancelled_at AS 'Cancelled',
l.created_at AS 'Created',
l.source AS 'Source',
u.first_name AS 'Owner First Name',
u.last_name AS 'Owner Last Name'
FROM `leads` AS l
LEFT JOIN `users` AS u ON
(u.`id` = l.`owner_id`)
LEFT JOIN `regions` AS rg ON
(rg.`id` = l.`region`)
WHERE l.`state` IS NOT NULL
[...]"";
</code></pre>

<p>When I put this into a PHP document it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?php
// Create connection
$con=mysqli_connect(""localhost"",""root"",""pass"",""database"");

// Check connection
if (mysqli_connect_errno($con))
  {
  echo ""Failed to connect to MySQL: "" . mysqli_connect_error();
  }

// And now for the good stuff

$result = mysqli_query($con,""SELECT

while($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result))
  {
  echo ""&lt;tr&gt;"";
  echo ""&lt;td&gt;"" . $row[""$LeadID""] . ""&lt;/td&gt;"";
  echo ""&lt;td&gt;"" . $row[""$l.type""] . ""&lt;/td&gt;"";
  echo ""&lt;/tr&gt;"";
  }
echo ""&lt;/table&gt;"";

mysqli_close($con);
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What seems to be happening is that I am able to create the table with no issue only when there is only one database being selected, and when I use LEFT JOIN, I have so far been unable to find a way to change the $row[""$variable""] input to something that will work.</p>

<p>I know that the data is there and I know that the connection works, it's just the LEFT JOIN that is giving me a bit of trouble. </p>

<p>Any help on this would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>[length] is file size.</p>

<p>[path] is files path.</p>

<p><strong>if elements inside [path] is more than 1 then all the elements except the last are parent directories order while last element is the file-name.</strong>
like this</p>

<pre><code> Array
        (
        [length] =&gt; 64109
        [path] =&gt; Array

<p>so far i have done like this </p>

<pre><code>    foreach($old_files as $x)
    {

        if (isset($x['path'][1])){
    //$path=$x['path'][0];
    $path = @iconv('utf-8', 'utf-8//ignore', $x['path'][0]);
    $path1 = @iconv('utf-8', 'utf-8//ignore', $x['path'][1]);
    $files[$path][$path1] = $x['length']; 

        }else{
    $path = @iconv('utf-8', 'utf-8//ignore', $x['path'][0]);
    $files[$path] =  $x['length'];
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>above code works for the one level deep arrays but not for multi level deep arrays.</p>

<p>how can i solve this ?</p>

<p>The code...</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    //updateVariable();
    $('#dannychoolink').html('&lt;?php dannyChoo()?&gt;');
    $('.danny-choo').attr('target', '_blank');
});

$('#clicky').mouseenter(function() {
       $('#dannychoolink').html('Click for a Random DannyChoo.com Article');
        }).click(function() {
            updateVariable();
            $('#dannychoolink').html('YA!');
            //$('#dannychoolink').html('&lt;?php dannyChoo()?&gt;');
            //$('.danny-choo').attr('target', '_blank');
        });

function updateVariable() {
    $.get('random.php',
           function(output){ 
                $('#dannychoolink').html(output);
                $('.danny-choo').attr('target', '_blank');
            }
        );
};
</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>updateVariable()</code> calls <code>random.php</code> which holds a single function which echos a database entry like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""http://www.dannychoo.com/post/en/26568/Nendoroid+Moekana.html"" class=""danny-choo""&gt;Nendoroid Moekana&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is to load a random entry (which is done inside the function) either on page load and click.</p>

<p>This works perfectly on my home page (http://www.danielbough.com), but does not work as expected on individual articles (the updateVariable function actually returns a WHOLE page of html identical to an individual article page - if that makes sense.)  Any page w/one article does it (http://www.danielbough.com/articles/fun-with-jquery-and-ajax for example.) </p>

<p>Each page is built w/individual files.  The 'homepage' is</p>

<ul>
<li>header.file  </li>
<li>navigation.file (the dannychoolink and clicky element<br>
reside here)  </li>
<li>homepage.file</li>
<li>footer.file</li>
</ul>

<p>Individual articles are as so:</p>

<ul>
<li>header.file </li>
<li>navigation.file (the dannychoolink and clicky element<br>
reside here) </li>
<li>view.file</li>
<li>footer.file</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought I might have some unmatched tags in view.file but there wasn't any that I could see.</p>

<p>I had to comment out the <code>updateVariable()</code> call in my document.ready function because it kept loading until the page crashed.</p>

<p>JavaConsole shows <code>'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token &lt; '</code> when the individual article pages are loaded or when I click the 'clicky' element.  I cant determine why.</p>

<p>Note, Google+ and Twitter calls are in the view.file too.  I removed them while testing, but it has no affect.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
The <code>'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token &lt; '</code> errors were caused by ckeditor.js and Googles jquery.min.js.  I've updated the Google js library to the 'full' version of 1.7.2 and removed the ckeditor.js to test.  The java errors went away, but the issue with the get function remains.</p>

<p>For multiple lines starting at the current line, add <code>.,.+&lt;line count&gt;</code>.  For example:</p>

So in my query result i have a numeration from 1 to 680 and then the numeration Begins at 1 when the second query starts. Is there a way to add a row numbering after the two queries finished so the numeration is from 1 to 1400?</p>

I'm making an application that simply gathers information and redirects to a URL with the info passed as parameters on the URL. I'm using the ASP.NET MVC 3 (.NET 4.0) framework and I've never had to redirect to a URL outside the application before.</p>

<p>My initial attempt, I did:</p>

<pre><code>return RedirectPermanent(""http://www.google.com?"" + qrystring);
</code></pre>

<p>This redirected to google, but I didn't see the parameters. I work at it a bit and change the URL to one inside the application but I'll still be using the full URL and not the routing because I want to ensure the values get there. Now, when I debug the application locally and mouse over my breakpoints it says:</p>

<p>""The breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols have been loaded for this document.""</p>

<p>Also, no matter what I change the URL to in my call to ""RedirectPermanent"", it always loads the Google page.</p>

<p>I've cleared out the Temporary Internet file history &amp; ensured the ASPNET user has access to the folder. I've also closed &amp; reopened the solution. I've also tried changing ""RedirectPermanent"" to ""Redirect"", but that didn't fix it. Breakpoints worked fine in this application before hitting that RedirectPermanent statement the first time.</p>

<p>FYI: I'm running Windows XP and am using IIS Express (ASP.NET Development Server). I'm also running the application locally in debug mode as opposed to on a server machine.

<p>Note that the requested URL is stated as <code>/applications/modules/web</code> instead of <code>/applications/modules/web forms for marketers</code>.</p>

<p>A lot of development has occurred on this site recently, so I'm not sure when exactly this started happening.</p>

<p>Additional: info:</p>

<ul>
<li>Folder and file permissions are correct.</li>
<li>I've tried reinstalling the WFFM package, and made sure that all the files are in place.</li>
<li>Several processors have been added to the HttpBeginRequest pipeline, but I removed them all to test if they were the cause - they weren't.</li>
<li>I haven't upgraded Sitecore since WFFM was working and the version is correct.</li>
<li>No errors are logged</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>EDIT</em></strong></p>

<p>This also seems to be affecting the Sitecore Security Editor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Requested URL: /appl</p>
  
  <p>User Name: sitecore\admin</p>
  
  <p>Site Name: shell</p>
  
  <p>If the page you are trying to display exists, please check that an
  appropriate prefix has been added to the IgnoreUrlPrefixes setting in
  the web.config.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em><strong>EDIT 2</em></strong> </p>

<p>Further investigation with this is making me think it is related to the Requested URL. I originally thought the the ""Not found"" page was displaying the requested url incorrectly. However, if I attempt to goto <code>mysite.com/sitecore/shell/applications/fake folder with spaces/fake page with spaces</code> I get this error message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Requested URL: /applications/fake folder with spaces/fake page with
  spaces</p>
  
  <p>User Name: sitecore\admin</p>
  
  <p>Site Name: shell</p>
  
  <p>If the page you are trying to display exists, please check that an
  appropriate prefix has been added to the IgnoreUrlPrefixes setting in
  the web.config.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see the Requested Url is correct in the error message. So in relation to my problem, I think maybe Sitecore is requesting the wrong URL in the first place.</p>

<p>Additionally if I go to the go the following url by typing directly into the browser, then the Security Editor opens as expected:
<code>mysite.com/sitecore/shell/Applications/Security/User-Editor</code></p>

"18664641","1","18665424","","2013-09-06 18:53:42","","2","3259","<p>Firstly, I know this question has been asked before, both in this site and others, but the answers are all rubbish for my scenario (if they're not rubbish entirely), and (at least for the question here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9479438/jquery-ui-drop-event-of-droppable-fires-on-sortable"">jQuery UI drop event of droppable fires on sortable</a>), the suggestion is just to turn off <code>.sortable</code> entirely, which is most certainly not what I want to do.</p>

<p>Okay, I have this jquery (keep in mind if any options or html ids look silly, this is just for testing so I can try and figure this out):</p>

<pre><code>$(function () {
    $(""#sortable"").sortable({
        revert: true
    });
    $(""#draggable, #draggable2"").draggable({
        connectToSortable: ""#sortable"",
        helper: ""clone"",
        revert: ""invalid""
    });

    $(""#sortable"").droppable({
        drop: function (event, ui) { alert(""done been triggered.""); }
    });

    $(""ul, li"").disableSelection();
});
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the valid markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""objectPaletteHolder""&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li id=""draggable"" class=""ui-state-highlight""&gt;Drag me down&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li id=""draggable2"" class=""ui-state-highlight""&gt;Drag this down, too&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li id=""draggable2"" class=""ui-state-highlight""&gt;Drag this down, also&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li id=""draggable2"" class=""ui-state-highlight""&gt;Drag this down, as well&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li id=""draggable2"" class=""ui-state-highlight""&gt;Drag this down, too&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li id=""draggable2"" class=""ui-state-highlight""&gt;Drag this down, too&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li id=""draggable2"" class=""ui-state-highlight""&gt;Drag this down, too&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li id=""draggable2"" class=""ui-state-highlight click""&gt;Drag this down, click&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li id=""draggable2"" class=""ui-state-highlight clicky""&gt;Drag this down, clicky&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=""editContainer""&gt;
    &lt;ul id=""sortable""&gt;
        &lt;li class=""ui-state-default""&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=""ui-state-default""&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=""ui-state-default""&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=""ui-state-default""&gt;Item 4&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=""ui-state-default""&gt;Item 5&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I do not have overlapping <code>sortable</code> divs or anything like that, and I think I understand <em>'why'</em> this is happening (because <code>sortable</code> gets draggables properties by default?), I just can't seem to do anything about it.</p>

<p>The problem, of course, is that the...</p>

<pre><code>drop: function (event, ui) { alert(""done been triggered.""); }
</code></pre>

<p>...is being triggered twice, when it is only needed once.</p>

<p>I would think that there would be a simple solution to this problem, for if this problem required a bunch of complex scripting to fix, than I would think that these particular jquery widgets wouldn't be worth all the trouble. Perhaps I am just confused?</p>

<p>The issue is that from time to time <code>e.Result</code> in <code>Done</code> is not complete. When I use either only <code>DownloadString</code> or <code>DownloadStringAsync</code> then it is most likely allways complete.
Is it normal and shall I just redownload it when it isn't complete or is the way I wrote it wrong? And in case it is wrong how would I force it to wait untill one of 10 <code>DownloadStringAsync</code> finishes its work?
Thanks.</p>

<p>(simplified example)</p>

<pre><code>Dim TFSContents as string
Dim ServerFileContents as string
Dim TFSItem As Item
Dim vcs As VersionControlServer

TFSItem = vcs.GetItem(pathtoTFSItem)
' this line gets the text contents of the file in TFS.
TFSContents = New StreamReader(TFSItem.DownloadFile(), System.Text.Encoding.Default).ReadToEnd
' this line gets the text contents of file on web server
ServerFileContents = File.ReadAllText(serverfilepath)

If ServerFileContents.ToString &lt;&gt; TFSContents.ToString Then
  'they are different
else
 ' they are the same
end if
</code></pre>

<p>This code works great most of the time, but sometimes it says two files are different when they are actually the same.  I'm finding that carriage returns and spaces are the differences.  When I visually look at the two files I'm comparing (one pulled from TFS, the other from file server) they are identical.  When I write the text I pull from TFS out to a file, then use a comparer tool to compare that file to my web server file, it says they are identical.</p>

<p>I wrote code to loop through each character in the strings and stop at the first character that is different.  The differences are always char(13) or char(32).  In other words, one file will have a space where the other has a carriage return.  The differences are always around line feeds, returns, or spaces.   It's weird also that the length of the strings is actually different (even though visually the text looks the same).  I'm assuming the length difference has something to do with a carriage return being more characters than a space. ?</p>

<p>I figure my issue has to do with encoding, but I can't seem to find a way around this.  I've tried different encoding settings when I create the streamreader object, but it doesn't seem to matter.  </p>

<p>Anyone got any ideas how I can compare the text of a file to the text of a file stored in TFS without this issue?  Please keep in mind I don't want to write the TFS file out to a drive. I want to do this in memory because I'm looping through many TFS items and comparing them.</p>

<p>I can eliminate the error message and get the application to run by commenting out the changes, but then I am left with the problem that the three lists (pets, cats, dogs) are identical, when I need cats and dogs to each be different subsets of pets. Here is the code which eliminates the error message but creates three identical lists which should not be identical:   </p>

<pre><code>@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy = ""owner"",  fetch=FetchType.EAGER)

private Set&lt;Pet&gt; dogs;// = new HashSet&lt;Pet&gt;();   
</code></pre>

<p>Per axiopisty's request, I cannot really comment out everything except the addition of cats and dogs because pets, cats and dogs are called from OwnerController.java as follows:  </p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value = ""/owners"", method = RequestMethod.GET)

    int ownrId = Integer.parseInt(ownerId);
    Owner sel_owner = this.clinicService.findOwnerById(ownrId);//jim added this

<p>Okay, well the basic answer to this would be using the:</p>

<pre><code>Cursor.Clip = new Rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2);
</code></pre>

<p>But my problem is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>What I need it to do is correctly map itself to a specific windows bounds so that the touch input will be restricted to that window, but will <strong>properly clip itself to the window so that when I touch the top-left corner or the bottom-right corner of the touch screen, it will place the cursor to the top-left or bottom-right of the window.</strong> Using <code>Cursor.Clip</code> will not do that and everything I touch on the touchscreen that outside of that clipping zone will just get mapped to it's closest edge of the window from where I am touching.</p>

<p>Is there anything that will allow me to pre-filter the mouse position so I can adjust it's bounds correctly?</p>

<h2>IF ALL ELSE FAILS</h2>

<p>Alternatively, I could try to find some code that will convert the mouse feed into <strong>TUIO</strong> input and feed it into the application that way, but I was hoping I wouldn't have to do that. So if anyone knows of how I can do that, that would be helpful to if my original request is not possible.</p>

<h2>FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I AM DOING</h2>

<p>If you need to know exactly why I am doing this, I am basically trying to feed the mouse events from a touch screen being fed in video into a 3D application that can take in touch inputs (through normal mouse events or TUIO) that will draw to that video, but has no way of maximizing to the full resolution of the screen because it will only render the size it is set to output at. </p>

<h2>TO BE CLEAR</h2>

<ul>
<li>I don't mind a normal mouse being disrupted by any of this. </li>
<li>I am talking about a Windows 7 system using the default Windows 7 Touch</li>
<li>The input is coming in via USB, not serial or anything like that.</li>

<p>When I look at the ""proper"" source, the theme source files don't exist, yet they get served.  If I search for the files in the IDE, I get some stuff in .path_to_grails_plugin directory (which is not in source control).  If I edit THERE, it picks up my changes, but that doesn't help the team...  and I want to point to a NEW theme, not mess up the original one. The Target directory has <em>some</em> of the files, but not all, but isn't that where <em>generated</em> content goes?  So where is the <em>REAL</em> source?  This feels like the dark arts to me.  I am clearly missing some fundamental knowledge about how this works.</p>

<p>I want to add a custom theme (theme-roller-generated), so I created a sub-folder for it in my web-app folder.  Then, in my config.groovy file I put: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>grails.resources.modules = {
    core {
        dependsOn 'jquery-ui'
    }
    // Define reference to custom jQuery UI theme
    overrides {
        'jquery-theme' {
             resource id: 'theme', url: '/css/theme-redo/jquery-ui-1.8.19.custom.css'
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That doesn't do anything.  It still serves the old css.  Help me find the light!</p>

I am trying to post a form with hidden values on a shop platform with payment gateway to receive the values.
The value name ""Order_Total"" uses php echo called ""$sum"" to display the sum to pay like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Input type=""hidden"" name=""sum"" value=""&lt;?php echo $order_total; ?&gt;""&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>$sum is a function which reads the user order id amount</p>

<pre><code>$order_total    = left_to_pay_for_order($oid);
</code></pre>

<p>the function works like this:</p>

<pre><code>function left_to_pay_for_order($oid)
{


global $wpdb;
    $s = ""select * from "".$wpdb-&gt;prefix.""order_contents where orderid='$oid' and paid='0'"";
    $r = $wpdb-&gt;get_results($s);
    $total = 0;
    if(count($r) &gt; 0)
    {
        foreach ($r as $row)
        {
            $total += $row-&gt;price * $row-&gt;quant;    
            $shp = get_post_meta($row-&gt;pid, 'shipping', true)* $row-&gt;quant;
            $total += $shp;
        }

    }

return $total;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Payment gateway receives all other values except the $order_total value.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE !!! --------------------------------
The value passed as '0' - Any thoughts on that can happen ?</strong></p>

<p>I have tested and the function works prior to sending the form and redirect, <strong>the sum display according to expected result on any HTML prior to sending, but the form send value ""0"".</strong></p>

<p>what am I doing wrong? have searched everywhere. your kind help is very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks !!</p>

<p>As per request here is the whole Form page Code - modified per StackOverflow:</p>

<p>He wrote each function in a separate .cpp file, then included them all in the main source file, something like this:</p>

<p><strong>main.cpp:</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include ""function1.cpp""
#include ""function2.cpp""
...
int main() 
{
...

}
</code></pre>

<p>He then <strong>compiled the code</strong>, with a single gcc line:</p>

<pre><code>g++ main.cpp    // took about 2 seconds 
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I know that this should work, but I'm not sure whether including .cpp files directly into the main program is a good idea. I have seen the following scheme several times, where all the function prototypes go into a header file with the extern keyword, like this:</p>

<p><strong>funcs.h:</strong></p>

<pre><code>extern void function1(..);
extern void function2(..);
...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>main.cpp:</strong></p>

<pre><code>...
#include ""funcs.h""
...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>&amp; compiling with:</strong></p>

<pre><code>g++ -c function1.cpp
g++ -c function2.cpp
...
g++ -c main.cpp
g++ -o final main.o function1.o function2.o ...
</code></pre>

<p>I think that this scheme is better (with a makefile, ofcourse). What reasons can I give my friend to convince him so? </p>

These agents all output the same format message (an entity object to be placed in a database). All the agents write to the one queue and we consume these and send them to a database via JPA. </p>

<p>So essentially the system has a collection of producers writing messages to one queue. The queue is single threaded and just takes the messages as they come and dumps them into the database. </p>

<p>The issue here is this method is slow. Is there any functionality in Camel (like re-sequencing) that we could use to split out these messages based on their source. So while the messages from Agent1 need to be persisted in the order they are created, the messages from Agent2 are separate so they should not wait on the order of Agent1's messages. For two agents this is an easy problem as we just create two queues, one for each agent. We have a number of agents, so we need a solution that can scale. </p>

<p>Are there any patterns to accomplish this natively in camel? We could write our own holdout queue which syncs on the Agent name and only ever puts one message through to a multi-threaded JPA write queue, but this would be a bit of a round-about way to do things as we would need to either setup a callback from the queue to jpa camel route or we would not use camel and just do it via our own manager (not that this would be complex, but it would be great if we could do this all using Camel or something else out there and not have to reinvent the wheel so to speak).</p>

Since I need both Fragments to look the same way, I use the same layout XML for both, which contains a ViewPager.</p>

<p>Now when I test the app, only the ViewPager of the first Fragment seems to work. The second Fragment shows a PagerTitleStrip, and I can flip through it, but it doesn't show the Fragments in the ViewPager.</p>

<p>Why isn't the second ViewPager showing the Fragments too? What is causing this?
Is the problem that they use the same layout? Isn't it a different Object anyway?</p>

<p>The layout that the 2 Fragments in the Activity share looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;android.support.v4.view.ViewPager xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    xmlns:tools=""http://schemas.android.com/tools""
    android:id=""@+id/pager""

        android:paddingBottom=""4dp""
        android:paddingTop=""4dp""
        android:textColor=""#fff"" /&gt;

&lt;/android.support.v4.view.ViewPager&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Both Fragments instantiate the ViewPager the same way:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
        Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_search_mapping,
            container, false);

    mSectionsPagerAdapter = new SectionsPagerAdapter(mActivity
            .getSupportFragmentManager());
    mViewPager = (ViewPager) view.findViewById(R.id.pager);
    mViewPager.setAdapter(mSectionsPagerAdapter);

    return view;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> More code showing my <code>SectionsPagerAdapter</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class SectionsPagerAdapter extends FragmentPagerAdapter {

    public SectionsPagerAdapter(FragmentManager fm) {
        super(fm);
    }

    @Override
    public Fragment getItem(int position) {
        Fragment fragment = new SuperclassFragment();
        Bundle args = new Bundle();
        args.putInt(SuperclassFragment.ARG_SECTION_NUMBER, position + 1);
        fragment.setArguments(args);
        return fragment;
    }

    ...

}

<p>Any tips where I should look for the cause of the bug? I can of course include more code here if necessary.</p>

<p>I am using Python, but figure that the logic is the same for any server side language. I have looked at facebook-sdk for Python <a href=""https://github.com/pythonforfacebook/facebook-sdk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pythonforfacebook/facebook-sdk</a>, but don't see how it is handled there, either.</p>

<ul>
<li>Does WPF always call the getter after setting a bound property when the setter doesn't throw an exception?</li>
<li>Is it possible to prevent the getter of a bound property from being called after an error has occurred in the setter when the ViewModel implements <code>IDataErrorInfo</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p>I currently have a Model class that implements validation by throwing an exception from the property setter.  Additionally, many of the properties are coupled, so modifying the value of one of them may cause several others to be recalculated.  It implements <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> to alert outside listeners whenever a recalculation has occurred.  It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Model : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private double property1;
    public double Property1
    {
        get { return property1; }
        set
        {
            if (value &lt; 0.0)
                throw new Exception(""Property1 cannot be less than 0.0."");

            property1 = value;
            OnPropertyChanged(new PropertyChangedEventArgs(""Property1""));
        }
    }

    // ...Everything needed to support INotifyPropertyChanged...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Initially, I implemented the ViewModel for this class to act as a thin wrapper around the model properties, providing additional view-specific behaviors whenever an error occurs (flagging invalid data, disabling buttons, etc.):</p>

<pre><code>public class ViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private readonly Model model;

    public ViewModel()
    {
        model = new Model();
        model.PropertyChanged += (sender, args) =&gt; OnPropertyChanged(args);
    }

    public string Property1
    {
        get { return model.Property1.ToString(); }
        set
        {
            try
            {
                model.Property1 = Double.Parse(value);
            }
            catch (Exception)
            {
                // Perform any view-specific actions
                throw;
            }
        }
    }

    // ...Everything needed to support INotifyPropertyChanged
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notably, the ViewModel doesn't have any additional backing fields; all of its properties are directly linked to the corresponding properties in the Model, and any <code>PropertyChanged</code> notifications from the Model are passed along by the ViewModel.</p>

<p>But, I've frequently heard that using exceptions for validation can be limiting, and I'm starting to realize the same, specifically as the need for cross-coupled validation rules has increased in this application.</p>

<p>I didn't want to change behaviors of the Model, since it is already being used in several other places, but I went about changing the ViewModel to implement <code>IDataErrorInfo</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class ViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged, IDataErrorInfo
{
    private readonly Model model;

    public ViewModel()
    {
        model = new Model();
        model.PropertyChanged += (sender, args) =&gt; 
        {
            errorList.Remove(args.PropertyName);
            OnPropertyChanged(args);
        };
    }

    public string Property1
    {
        get { return model.Property1.ToString(); }
        set
        {
            try
            {
                model.Property1 = Double.Parse(value);
            }
            catch(Exception ex)
            {
                // Perform any view-specific actions                    
                errorList[""Property1""] = ex.Message;
            }
        }
    }

    private readonly Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; errorList = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();

    public string this[string propertyName]
    {
        get
        {
            string errorMessage;
            if (errorList.TryGetValue(propertyName, out errorMessage))
                return errorMessage;
            return String.Empty;
        }
    }

    public string Error { get { return String.Empty; } }

    // ...Everything needed to support INotifyPropertyChanged
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, this caused a drastic unwanted change in behavior.  When using exceptions, after the user entered an invalid value, the <code>Validation.ErrorTemplate</code> for the control is displayed and the invalid value remains in the control, thus giving the user the opportunity to correct their mistake.  When using <code>IDataErrorInfo</code>, WPF seems to call the property getter after the setter has completed.  Since the Model hasn't changed whenever an error occurs, the invalid value is replaced by the previous value.  So now I have a control displaying the <code>Validation.ErrorTemplate</code> but with a VALID being value displayed!</p>

<p>It seems crazy to me that WPF would automatically call a property getter without receiving a <code>PropertyChanged</code> notification (after the window has been initialized).  And it doesn't attempt to call the getter after an exception is thrown, so why would it do it when <code>IDataErrorInfo</code> is used?</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong that's causing this behavior?  Is there a way to prevent WPF from calling the property getter in the ViewModel after an error has occurred in the setter when the ViewModel implements <code>IDataErrorInfo</code>?</p>

<p>I've tried adding backing fields to the ViewModel to store the invalid value, but due to the fact Model properties can be modified outside of the ViewModel (that's the reason it implements <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> in the first place), the solution ends up being quite complex and basically unsustainable in an environment with programmers of varying skill levels.</p>

<p>It doesn't appear to matter what column name I supply to <code>JoinedSubClass</code> it ignores it and uses <code>AbstractProduct_id</code> instead.</p>

<p>How can I tell nhibernate the key column is <code>ProductId</code> and not <code>AbstractProduct_id</code>?</p>

<p>I have a test project demonstrating the issue available <a href=""http://wallaceturner.com/get/FluentNHibernateSubClassTest.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> (you need to create the db)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I've got around this by providing the following convention:</p>

<pre><code>public class JoinedSubclassConvention : IJoinedSubclassConvention
{
    public void Apply(IJoinedSubclassInstance instance)
    {
        if (instance.EntityType == typeof(SingleProduct))
            instance.Key.Column((""ProductId""));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>which works but feels like its the wrong way or a hack. </p>

<pre><code>class MasterScreen &lt; PM::TableScreen
  title 'States'

  def table_data
    [{
      title: ""Northwest States"",
      cells: [
        { title: ""Oregon"", action: :view_details, arguments: { state: @oregon }},

      ]
    }]
  end

  def view_details
    open DetailScreen.new(nav_bar: true)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to move the names of the states (basically the cell titles) into something like a YAML or JSON file that I can load and iterate over. How can I achieve something like this?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I managed to figure out how to load text from a file.</p>

<p>First I added <code>bubble-wrap</code> to my <code>Gemfile</code> and ran <code>bundle install</code>. BubbleWrap provides the helper method <code>App.resources_path</code>.</p>

<p>In <code>my_app/resources/states.txt</code> I have a list of states, separated by new lines:</p>

<pre><code>Oregon
Washington
Foobar
</code></pre>

<p>In my Table View Controller, I read the file and split the file into an array of lines.</p>

<pre><code>class MasterScreen &lt; PM::TableScreen
  title 'States'

  def on_load
    data = File.read(""#{App.resources_path}/states.txt"")
    @states = data.lines
  end

  def table_data
    [{
      title: ""Northwest States"",
      cells: @states.map do |state|
        {
          title: state,
          action: :view_details,
          arguments: { state: state }
        }
      end
    }]
  end

  def view_details(arguments)
    open DetailScreen.new(nav_bar: true, title: arguments[:state])
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but it's only part of what I was trying to do. I would still like to use a structure like YAML to represent titles and subtitles. What would be the RubyMotion way to do this sort of thing?</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>I'm making a winforms app with a region (panel) that is expandable or collapsible. </p>

<p>I used the expand/collapse bitmaps from the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms247035.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">VS2008 Image library</a>, for the buttons.  I put those two into an ImageList.  </p>

<p>I wanted the button to have no border, so I set FlatStyle = Flat, FlatAppearance.BorderSize = 0.  </p>

<p>On the click event for the button, I have</p>

<pre><code>private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (splitContainer1.Panel1Collapsed == true)
    {
        splitContainer1.Panel1Collapsed = false;
        button1.ImageIndex = 0;
        this.toolTip1.SetToolTip(this.button1, ""Collapse"");
    }
    else
    {
        splitContainer1.Panel1Collapsed = true;
        button1.ImageIndex = 1;
        this.toolTip1.SetToolTip(this.button1, ""Expand"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But the transparency in the bitmap is not respected.  My understanding was that the color used in the top-left (or is it bottom-left?) corner of the bitmap will be treated as transparent, so when the bitmap is displayed, any pixels with that same color value will be transparent.  But I don't get those results.  Instead I get the transparent color to show up as its true color. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/2lm72v9.jpg"" alt=""alt text""> <img src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/oa6wb4.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I found a way to avoid this by providing an OnPaint method for the button, and manually drawing the bmp after calling MakeTransparent() on it, like this: </p>

<pre><code>private void button1_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e)
{
    // This draws the image on the button, and makes the bmp
    // background color as transparent. Why this isn't done
    // automatically, I don't know. 
    Bitmap bmp = (Bitmap) imageList1.Images[button1.ImageIndex];
    bmp.MakeTransparent();
    int x = (button1.Width - bmp.Width) / 2;
    int y = (button1.Height - bmp.Height) / 2;
    e.Graphics.DrawImage(bmp, x, y);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>But isn't there a simpler way?</strong></p>

<p>As you can see, for the <code>void insert(T key, BST&lt;T&gt;::TreeNode* leaf)</code> and <code>BST&lt;T&gt;::TreeNode* BST&lt;T&gt;::search(T key, TreeNode* leaf)</code> functions I need to do things with <code>TreeNode</code> class like returning an object of it or passing it to a function, which is a nested type defined in class <code>BST</code>.
The errors I am getting are at syntax errors, but I don't know where I am doing wrong in the code.
Any advice or suggestion would be appreciated!</p>

<p>This was previously working (after an issue where I was using the 64-bit original DLL instead of the 32-bit one) but somehow it has now stopped working and I'm not sure what the issue is.</p>

<p>I don't think it's an issue with it finding the DLL file - removing the DLL file or using the wrong one results in LoadLibrary failing without causing a crash, error code 193.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

Since <code>content_transformer</code> requires a specific function format, the easy way is to use <code>&lt;&lt;-</code> in my function. The problem occurs with the code below:</p>

<pre><code>library(tm)
a &lt;- 4
n &lt;- 2
corp&lt;-VCorpus(VectorSource(rep(""fish"",n)))
(func&lt;-content_transformer(
  function(x) {
    a &lt;&lt;- 42

}))
corp&lt;-tm_map(corp,func)
print(a)
</code></pre>

<p>It prints the wrong answer, i.e. 4. But with n=1, it prints the right one. So I assume it is the multi-threading that tm does that fails to behave as scalar R. I guess it's a bug since on windows, it works. (Note: I use R 3.1.2 on linux and R 3.1.1 on windows).</p>

<p>Questions: is it a bug? if yes, a known bug? Is there an easy solution that does not require to refactor the code?</p>

<p>My current code works initially but, during development, the Morphia query inside the socket Iteratee stops working after a development reload. Regular requests, even requests that make the exact same query, continue to work fine.</p>

<p>I'm using the distributed pub sub mediator Akka plugin. Here's the relevant code for the actor representing the web socket listener:</p>

<pre><code>object Subscriber {
  def props(channel: Concurrent.Channel[JsValue]): Props = Props(new Subscriber(channel))
}

class Subscriber(channel: Concurrent.Channel[JsValue]) extends Actor {
  def receive = {
    case StatusUpdate(...) =&gt;
      channel.push(...)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And for the main view controller:</p>

<pre><code>object SocketController extends Controller {
  val mediator = DistributedPubSubExtension.get(Akka.system).mediator

  def index = WebSocket.using[JsValue] { implicit request =&gt;
    val (out, channel) = Concurrent.broadcast[JsValue]

    val ws = Akka.system.actorOf(Subscriber.props(channel))

    val in = Iteratee.foreach[JsValue] { msg =&gt;
      (msg \ ""type"").as[String] match {
        case ""Subscribe"" =&gt;
          val target = (msg \ ""value"").as[String]

          // Query database with Morphia
          val current = MyObj.findByName(target)

          // Notify of current state
          ws ! StatusUpdate(target, current)

          // Subscribe for further updates
          mediator ! DistributedPubSubMediator.Subscribe(target, ws)
      }
    }

    (in, out)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem occurs in the query statement in the Iterattee. After a reload, Morphia throws
<code>org.mongodb.morphia.mapping.MappingException: Could not map models.MyObj with ID: 5507a3653004b8a9e8f3d3b2</code>. Here's the full trace:</p>

<p>This exception only happens in the web socket handler, regular request can make the query just fine. Fully restarting the development server fixes the problem until the next reload.</p>

<p>Here's the console logs from startup and one restart: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/xsstw4ki"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/xsstw4ki</a></p>

<p>Any thoughts on what may be going on here?

<p>With newer PHP versions, APC is deprecated. I will use the native opcache for the first feature.</p>

<p>However, I'm wondering about installing APCu for caching.
If Symfony and its core bundles (Doctrine, Twig...) don't rely on APC memory caching functions, then installing APCu won't affect performance at all.</p>

<p>So does Symfony2 natively leverage APCu / the memory caching part of APC?</p>

After some investigation yet I've simplified issue to almost trivial case (original version saved below):</p>

<p>Basically <strong>why I need my Global variable is to keep track currently active activity</strong>, and it should be accessable from any type of class, like <strong>Activity</strong>, <strong>AsyncTask</strong>, <strong>Service</strong>, <strong>Receiver</strong>, <strong>Application</strong>, Etc...</p>

<p><strong>I know there is lot of questions=answers in here, but none of those helped me.</strong></p>

<p>I tried several ways to do this, but couldn't find any real resolution for this.</p>

<p>With <strong>SharedPreferences</strong>, I can use it, but after preferences updated and readed, returned previous value, works only after restart app.</p>

<p>With <strong>Application Class</strong>, no luck, can't access to Application from AsyncTask and service</p>

<p><strong>Service</strong> runs <strong>AsyncTask</strong> on every 5sec, and AsyncTask should know if MainActivity is opened and running, so it can update contents to it.</p>

<p>I got pretty much everything working but, with this, I spend way too many hours on searching.</p>

<p>So please, if anybody can help me with this, it would be nice. :)</p>

<p><strong>Here is little example how I do..</strong></p>

<p><strong>MainActivity.java</strong></p>

The Pressed drawable is a selector, but with no state specified; it is wired up via XML to be the android:listSelector for the list.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;selector
    xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""&gt;
    &lt;item
        android:drawable=""@drawable/my_actual_drawable"" /&gt;
&lt;/selector&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Selected drawable, however, is applied by code, because it's complicated and more than one simple background drawable change needs to happen when an item is selected.</p>

<p>If I click very quickly between two list items, one item can have (and keep) the Selected highlight while a different item has (and keeps) the Pressed highlight.  I believe this is because the press happens so quickly that it is not interpreted by the underlying framework as a click, so no <code>onItemClick</code> reaches my list.</p>

<p>One solution is to use the selector with state (that's what selectors are for!):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;selector
    xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""&gt;
    &lt;item android:state_pressed=""true""
        android:drawable=""@drawable/my_actual_drawable"" /&gt;
&lt;/selector&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but this has the unfortunate effect of turning off the Pressed highlight before my code can apply the Selected highlight, so there is a flash of unhighlightedness between the two states, no matter how early in the <code>onItemClick</code> handler I put the <code>setBackgroundResource</code> call.</p>

<p>Another solution would be to monitor not only <code>onItemClick</code> events, but also <code>onTouch</code> events, and handle everything in code; that appears to make things too slow.</p>

<p>What can I do to avoid both the flash and the double-selection state?</p>

<p>I move by clicking a square with a piece on it, then the square becomes selected, and then clicking where I want to piece to move. Sometimes in chess, a move may fail to respond to check or create a check on one's own king and is therefore illegal. The best way, I've found, to decide whether a move is illegal is to make a move on an ""ifBoard"" (a clone of the board) and if I deem the move legal, set the real board equal to the ifBoard.</p>

<p>The reason I care about this is because I am wrapping the internals of a function with <code>ActiveRecord::Base.transaction</code> so I want to test that they are not updated when something goes wrong:</p>

<p>Rspec test (that passes all the time when it's not supposed to, since updated_at isn't being changed regardless of success or failure):</p>

<pre><code>  it ""rollsback the transaction"" do
    ...
    order.stub(:save!).and_raise(StandardError)
    expect { payment_info.save }.not_to change { [billing_address.updated_at, 
                                                  shipping_address.updated_at,
                                                  order.user.updated_at,

  end

<p>And my method:</p>

<pre><code>def process_billing_info!

    billing_address.save!
    shipping_address.save!

<p>I found <a href=""http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080426061306AA2Od0x"" rel=""nofollow"">a question on yahoo about implicit declaration</a>, but to my surprise, it did not answer.</p>

<p>Besides, I'm a monkey-see-monkey-do programmer, so the only way I'm going to get this is to see it in action.  Please explain with respect to the above definition of ""trivial"" by using the example provided in the first answer, that <code>std::string</code> has a trivial assignment operator by using <code>new</code> or <code>delete</code> or for a less apparent reason.</p>

However I want to test my master at specific points along the way so I ensure I only rebase upstream onto master at certain points.</p>

<p>Assume the following state:</p>

<pre><code>          --F--G--H--&gt; master
         /
        /
----A--B--C--D--E--I--J--&gt; upstream
</code></pre>

<p>I want first to rebase C and D and then test. So I do:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout upstream
$ git checkout D
$ git checkout -b upstreamD
$ git rebase -i master
$ git checkout master
$ git merge upstreamD
</code></pre>

<p>This shows me C and D to rebase. After successful rebase I have:</p>

<pre><code>          --F--G--H--C--D--&gt; master
         /
        /
----A--B--C--D--E--I--J--&gt; upstream
             ^
         upstreamD
</code></pre>

<p>Then I removed upstream cause I didn't need it anymore while testing, etc (cause I can always get it).</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch -d upstreamD
$ git branch -d upstream
$ git remote rm upstream
</code></pre>

<p>I do my testing and since everything is fine I go back and grab my upstream using a newly created remote and put its master in branch upstream.</p>

<p>So, now I think I have something like (notice master and upstream have more commits):</p>

<pre><code>          --F--G--H--C--D--K--L--&gt; master
         /
        /
----A--B--C--D--E--I--J--M--N--&gt; upstream
</code></pre>

<p>And I want to rebase a bit more so I execute the same procedure above:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout upstream
$ git checkout J
$ git checkout -b upstreamJ
$ git rebase -i master
</code></pre>

<p>However, now I get to rebase something like: C, E, I, J. The strange thing is that I was only expecting E, I, J. C is in master already (even if under a different SHA1, since history is different).</p>

<p>In <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html</a> it says and I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the upstream branch already contains a change you have made (e.g.,
  because you mailed a patch which was applied upstream), then that
  commit will be skipped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn't find anywhere where it explains how git performs this skipping. How does it check that C is already in master or not, and why does it decide that C should be rebased again and D shouldn't?</p>

<p>Therefore, I am using RelativeLayout, defining a dummy textbox as a placeholder, and putting my view RIGHT_TO and BELOW the textbox.</p>

<pre><code>+--------+
|TextView|
|        | (x,y)
+--------+-----------------------+
         |                       |
         |     My View           |
         |                       |
         +-----------------------+
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> Is there a more robust and elegant way to do that?</p>

<p>The problem with the way suggested above, is that it's very fragile: The coordinates need to be recalculated for every new screen. My view overlays something below. It needs to be accurately placed, which is pretty difficult to do.</p>

<ul>
<li>I will need to layout the screen again whenever rotated or zoomed or whatever. <strong>Worse:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>On init time, the typical time for placing the images, the coordinates of the screen are not valid. The coordinates are valid after placing the entities on screen. In order to place the entities on screen accurately, we need coordinates. Chicken and egg problem :(</li>
<li>On rotation, the coordinates include the margins rather than the width of the view itself (example: on a portrait AVD, display a portrait ImageView, then press CTRL+F12 to rotate. The left, right, top and bottom of the ImageView are totally not as expected).</li>
<li>When Scale-Animating, coordinates are scaled.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So I would like to find a better way to do that.</p>

that is , let my phone be a IP Camera , and server can watch the live video from my phone</p>

<p>I have googled many many solutions, 
but there is no one can solve my problem.
I use MediaRecorder to record . 
it can save video file in the SD card correctly.
then , I refered <a href=""http://www.mattakis.com/blog/kisg/20090708/broadcasting-video-with-android-without-writing-to-the-file-system"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a> and used some method as followings</p>

<pre><code> skt = new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(hostname),port);
 pfd =ParcelFileDescriptor.fromSocket(skt);
 mediaRecorder.setOutputFile(pfd.getFileDescriptor());
</code></pre>

<p>now it seems I can send the video stream while recording</p>

<p>however, I wrote a receiver-side program to receive the video stream from Android , 
but it doesn't work . is there any error?
I can receive file , but I can not open the video file .
I guess the problem may caused by  file format ?</p>

<p>there are outline of my code.</p>

<p>in android side</p>

<pre><code>    Socket skt = new Socket(hostIP,port);
ParcelFileDescriptor pfd =ParcelFileDescriptor.fromSocket(skt);
....
....
mediaRecorder.setAudioSource(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC);
mediaRecorder.setVideoSource(MediaRecorder.VideoSource.DEFAULT);
mediaRecorder.setOutputFormat(MediaRecorder.OutputFormat.MPEG_4);
mediaRecorder.setOutputFile(pfd.getFileDescriptor());
.....
mediaRecorder.setAudioEncoder(MediaRecorder.AudioEncoder.DEFAULT);
mediaRecorder.setVideoEncoder(MediaRecorder.VideoEncoder.MPEG_4_SP);
.....
mediaRecorder.start();
</code></pre>

<p>in receiver side (my ACER notebook)</p>

<pre><code>// anyway , I don't think the file extentions will do any effect                
File video = new File (strDate+"".3gpp"");
FileOutputStream fos;
try {

byte[] data = new byte[1024];

}

<p>I'm writing a java program (new to java also) - the purpose of the program is to generate an XML file with information from multiple databases.</p>

<p>The setup - I have sql.java which is the main class and has the main method.  Sql.java calls methods located in the CCReturns.java class, GBLRets.java class, and CWSReturns.java class.  Each method returns a string of XML containing pertinent information and then the main method in sql.java puts them all together in one string and creates an xml file.</p>

<p>Problem: One of my methods in CWSReturns should return a resultset containing 74 rows in all but is only returning the data from one of the rows.  When I put this same code into the sql.java main method all 74 rows are returned in the console but the xml file only shows the data from one of the rows and all of the data from all of my other methods is repeated even though I only need it to output once.</p>

<p>What would be the best way to go about fixing this issue?  I'm stumped.</p>

<pre><code>Process mstsc = Process.Start(mstscLocation, mstscConString);

DataRow row = openConn.NewRow();
row[""RDP ID""] = mstscID;

<p>I have verified that the PID that is recorded from Process.Start is the same as is retrieved from the DataGridView (dgvOpenConnections) and placed into rpdID (try fails and hits catch as the original PID no longer exists). Furthermore, I have issued a ""tasklist"" at a command prompt after starting one instance of MSTSC.EXE and can verify that it changes PIDs (in this test, C# recorded 4288 but tasklist shows it running as 8172).</p>

<p>I cannot kill all MSTSC processes as I am trying to control more than one. Is there a way to trace down the second PID MSTSC appears to use? My guess is it either starts a second process and gets rid of the first or maybe this is a child process (although the PID that is return no longer exists after start).</p>

<p>This is my <code>Message</code> entity:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @ORM\Entity

 */
class Message {

    /**
     * @ORM\Id

    protected $text;

    /**
     * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity=""User"")
     * */
    private $user;    
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is my <code>User</code> entity:</p>

<pre><code>/**

class User {

    /**

    /**

</code></pre>

<p>Then in controller I send <code>$messages</code> variable to Twig template:</p>

<pre><code>$messages = $this-&gt;getDoctrine()-&gt;getEntityManager()-&gt;getRepository('MeMyBundle:Message')-&gt;findAll()

<p>And the question is: Is the joing made properly? How can I access <code>name</code> property through <code>message</code> in Twig? Thanks.</p>

<ol>
<li>User requests password reset;</li>
<li>User enters email address;</li>
<li>System validates email address - if invalid tells user and process ends, else an email is sent to the entered email address containing a hashed token in a link;</li>
<li>User clicks link in email;</li>
<li>System receives reset request with token embedded - validates the token and time limit (60 mins);</li>
<li>if reset request is valid, a reset password view is displayed with two password fields, else user told the request is invalid and the process exits;</li>
<li>Assuming valid request, the user enters their password twice which are then validated by a comparison.</li>
</ol>

<p>This seems to be current best practice.</p>

<p>My question is how this is achieved using MVC. I have a front controller which sucks in data from <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> requests, and passes the data on to the relevant view-model and view through a router class.</p>

<p>Using this model, I have a reset-password view-model and view that takes care of the user's email input and the email to the address with the linked token - all good here.</p>

<p>I also have a view-model and view for the user to enter their new password. It is here I am having issues.  This validates the incoming token and time limit - this is working. Then, if the token and time limit are valid it presents the user with the set-password view, which needs to be validated. I have not been able to come up with a solution using the set-password view-model and view that allows me to present the set password view AND validates, presenting the user the reasons for the passwords not being valid (either of the password fields are empty, or passwords do not match).</p>

<p>I hope I have been clear with my issue. Could someone suggest a best practice solution to my issue that addresses the process please? I am thinking I am doing too much in the second part of the process - breaking up the work and introducing a new view-model (invisible to the user) to take care of the token and time validation before passing on to the set-password part is one solution I am looking at, but it feels wrong. It doesn't have the aethestic appeal my incorrect solution has (less is good).</p>

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>JS: </p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){

    $('.status').change(function(){
        var status = $(this);
        var val = $(status).val();
        var id = $(status).attr('data-id');

<p>Again, this is a table with multiple items, each of which has a <code>.status</code> select field. I can see in the console on the second attempt to fire the modal I'm getting the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
</code></pre>

<p>Associated to this line in the JS:</p>

<pre><code>$('#modal').modal();
</code></pre>

<p>If I comment out <code>$('.modal-body').load()</code>, it works. </p>

<p>I tried rewriting it into a separate ajax call instead of using <code>.load()</code>, but I have the same problem there. It seems like as soon as I manipulate the '.modal-body' it looses the ability to fire the modal.</p>

<li>I want to be able to run the program off-line and without having to manage the security risks involved with accessing a remote server.</li>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To clarify, I mean that <em>the application should be accessible only from the local network and not from the Internet</em>.</p>

<p>As I've been seeking out information on the issue, I've encountered one or two remarks suggesting that local servers have their own security risks, but I'm not clear on the nature or severity of those risks.</p>

<p>(In case it is relevant, I will be using SWI-Prolog for handling the data manipulation. I also plan on using the <a href=""http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/package/http.html"" rel=""nofollow"">SWI-Prolog HTTP package</a> for the server, but I am willing to reconsider this choice if it turns out to be a bad idea.)</p>

<li>What security risks does one need to be aware of when using a local server for this purpose? (Note: In my case, the program will likely deal with some very sensitive information, so I don't have room for any laxity on this issue).</li>

<p>In this basic version, everything passes through the <code>app.js</code> file. Every HTTP method is then passed to the resource that has been requested. This allows me to dynamically add resources to the API and every request will be passed along accordingly. To illustrate:</p>

<pre><code>// app.js

var express = require('express');
var mongoose = require('mongoose');

var app = express();
app.use(express.bodyParser());

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/kittens');
var db = mongoose.connection;

var resources = [
  'kitten'
];

var repositories = {};

for (var i = 0; i &lt; resources.length; i++) {
  var resource = resources[i];
  repositories[resource] = require('./api/' + resource);
}

db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'connection error:'));
db.once('open', function callback() {
  console.log('Successfully connected to MongoDB.');

  app.get('/:resource', function (req, res) {
    res.type('application/json');
    repositories[req.params.resource].findAll(res);
  });

  app.get('/:resource/:id', function (req, res) {
    res.type('application/json');
    repositories[req.params.resource].findOne(req, res);
  });

  app.listen(process.env.PORT || 4730);
});
</code></pre>

<p>-</p>

<pre><code>// api/kitten.js

var mongoose = require('mongoose');

var kittenSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  name: String
});

var Kitten = mongoose.model('Kitten', kittenSchema);

exports.findAll = function (res) {
  Kitten.find(function (err, kittens) {
    if (err) {
    }
    res.json(kittens);
  });
};

exports.findOne = function (req, res) {
  Kitten.findOne({ _id: req.params.id}, function (err, kitten) {
    if (err) {
    }
    res.json(kitten);
  });
};
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, only a couple of methods have been implemented so far. What do you guys think of this approach? Anything I could improve on?</p>

<p>Also, a small side question: I have to require mongoose in every API resource file (like in <code>api\kitten.js</code>, is there a way to just globally require it in the app.js file or something?</p>

<p>Any input is greatly appreciated!</p>

$config = array('data_fixtures_path'  =&gt;  dirname(__FILE__) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'fixtures',
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting paths appear correct.</p>

<p>Second adjustment: The generated models (e.g. <code>models/User.php</code>) don't seem to load the base models that extend <code>Doctrine_Record</code>, so I add an explicit <code>require()</code> call to each model like so:</p>

<pre><code>require('generated/BaseUser.php');

class User extends BaseUser { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>So, my current problem: When it comes time to build the tables for the first time:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./doctrine build-all-reload
build-all-reload - Are you sure you wish to drop your databases? (y/n)
y
build-all-reload - Successfully dropped database for connection named 'mydb'
build-all-reload - Successfully created database for connection named 'mydb'
build-all-reload - Created tables successfully
SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'mydb.user' doesn't exist
</code></pre>

<p>Doctrine seems to happily empty tables, drop tables, drop databases, and create databases, but I can't figure out why it won't <em>create</em> tables. It clearly says <code>Created tables successfully</code>, but <code>SHOW TABLES;</code> returns ""No tables found in database.""</p>

<p>Doctrine is using the same MySQL user that I am, which has <code>ALL PRIVILEGES</code>.</p>

<p>Any ideas why Doctrine can't create tables? Hopefully I'm just blind and/or dumb.</p>

<p>Alternatively, is there I way I can just produce a file of SQL CREATE statements based on my yaml schema or models that I can run on my own to debug this issue?</p>

<p>I have a piece of (jQuery) ajax code that has been happily working for about 9 months until the last couple of weeks or so. </p>

<p>This code uses Instagram's <a href=""http://instagram.com/developer/embedding/"" rel=""nofollow"">embedding endpoints</a> that allows me to get the media source (image or video) out of a normal Instagram link like <code>http://instagram.com/p/BUG/</code> regardless the user and <strong>without</strong> needing an <code>access_token</code>.</p>

<p>Simplified example :</p>

<pre><code>var URL = ""http://api.instagram.com/oembed?url=http://instagram.com/p/BUG/"";
$(document).ready(function () {
    $.ajax({
        url: URL,
        dataType: ""jsonp"",
        cache: false,
        success: function (response) {
            console.log(response.url);
        },
        error: function () {
            console.log(""couldn't process the instagram url"");
        }
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>In the code above, <code>response.url</code> would return the full media URL source like :</p>

<pre><code>http://photos-a.ak.instagram.com/xxxx/1234_123456123_123456_n.jpg // image or
http://distilleryvesper3-15.ak.instagram.com/b0c957463548362858_101.mp4 // video
</code></pre>

<p>Then I could use the returned URL to embed the media file in my webpage.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> : </p>

<p>Since the idea is to get the URL source of any Instagram link regardless the user, using <a href=""http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/media/#"" rel=""nofollow"">media endpoints</a> is not an option.</p>

<hr>

<h2>THE ISSUE</h2>

<p>Instagram's oembed endpoints allows you to GET a <code>json</code> response, which until the last couple of weeks had this structure :</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""provider_url"" : ""http:\/\/instagram.com\/"",
    ""media_id"" : ""123456789_123456789"",
    ""title"" : ""the title"",
    ""url"" : ""http:\/\/photos-a.ak.instagram.com\/hphotos-ak-xfp1\/12345678_123456789012345_1234567890_n.jpg"",
    ""author_name"" : ""{the user name}"",
    ""height"" : 640,
    ""width"" : 640,
    ""version"" : ""1.0"",
    ""author_url"" : ""http:\/\/instagram.com\/{the user name}"",
    ""author_id"" : 123456789,
    ""type"" : ""photo"",
    ""provider_name"" : ""Instagram""
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you may noticed, my ajax code was particularly interested in the property name <code>url</code>, which contains the full media's URL. </p>

<p><strong>Notice</strong> that this <code>json</code> response (as today) is still valid for Instagram images, <strong>however</strong>, if the original Instagram's link is a video, let's use a real example : <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/mOFsFhAp4f/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://instagram.com/p/mOFsFhAp4f/</a> (CocaCola(c)) the <code>json</code> response doesn't return any <code>url</code> key anymore.</p>

<p>It seems that after the introduction of <a href=""http://blog.instagram.com/post/55095847329/introducing-instagram-web-embeds"" rel=""nofollow"">web embeds</a> Instagram has decided to replace the key <code>url</code> by a <code>html</code> property in their (oembed) json response for videos only, which contains the iframe to embed like :</p>

<pre><code>{
    ...

    ""html"" : ""\u003ciframe src=\""http:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/BUG\/embed\"" width=\""616\"" height=\""716\"" frameborder=\""0\"" scrolling=\""no\"" allowtransparency=\""true\""\u003e\u003c\/iframe\u003e"",

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>... and of course, that breaks my code since <code>response.url</code> is undefined.</p>

<hr>

<h2>THE QUESTION</h2>

<p><strong>How do I get the full video's URL after the changes in the Instagram json response?</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately I couldn't find any proper documentation or a change log in Instagram's developers site (they have a great API but poor documentation.)</p>

<p>Please <strong>notice</strong> that the question is about Instagram API (v1) embedding endpoints rather than a jQuery or ajax question.</p>

<p>I am looking for (an undocumented perhaps) Instagram's API option, endpoint, oembed or else (that doesn't require <code>access_token</code>) that allows me to retrieve the direct link to the media video (after a json response preferably) out of a normal Instagram link regardless the user ...or willing to consider a not too hacky workaround.</p>

total = (10*lunch1 + 5*lunch2 + 40*tix + regCost*1);
var output = $(form).find('.total');
$(output).val(total);
} 
</code></pre>

<p>This code works on the textboxes to update the value in the .total field. However, the same code does not work right on the radiobuttonlist. The code for it is here:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:RadioButtonList ID = ""RegType"" runat = ""server"" name=""regType"" onclick=""calcTotal(this.form)""&gt;
    &lt;asp:ListItem Value=""50""&gt;Family ($50)&lt;/asp:ListItem&gt;
    &lt;asp:ListItem Value=""35""&gt;Individual ($35)&lt;/asp:ListItem&gt;
    &lt;asp:ListItem Value=""10""&gt;Student ($10)&lt;/asp:ListItem&gt;
&lt;/asp:RadioButtonList&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone know why this might be or how I could fix it?
Thanks!</p>

Here is the service the way it is generated by Typescript
</p>

<pre><code>var app = angular.module('app',[]);
app.constant('baseUrl', 'http://localhost:63342');

//This follows the pattern created by Typescript
var myService = function(){
    function myService($http, baseUrl){
        this.$http = $http;
        this.baseUrl = baseUrl;
        this.http = typeof this.$http;
        this.url = typeof this.baseUrl;

    myService.$inject = ['$http', 'baseUrl'];
    return myService
}

app.factory('myService', [
    '$http', 'baseUrl',
    myService
]);

app.controller('myCtrl',
        ['$scope', 'myService',

<p>When I run the code locally the p tags get the ng-bind attributes set on them.  But, of course, they have nothing in them.  When I break on the $scope assignments, myService is available and it has the $inject variable, but none of the other 4 variables.  The available examples for Typescript and angular are pretty thin.  There must be something really basic I am doing wrong.</p>

}


void Update () {

        nextFire = Time.time + fireRate;

        launchPosition = cameraTransform.TransformPoint(0, 0, 0.2f);

        poolObject.Activate();

        poolObject.transform.position = launchPosition;
        poolObject.transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(cameraTransform.eulerAngles.x + 90, myTransform.eulerAngles.y, 0);

    }

}
}

<p>My shoot script is giving me two errors:</p>

<p><strong>1. The type or namespace name 'poolName' could not be found. Are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. 'PoolObject.Activate()' is inaccessible due to its protection level</strong></p>

I am not directly asking for an opinion on which is best (although obviously it would be appreciated). I just simply need some guidance.</p>

<p>I am wanting to start on a hobby project but its going to be a big old thing so I wanted to start off small. I basically need to know how to stream a video of my desktop (or any desktop) into a WPF application. Future enhancements would include doing multiple displays from different computers on a network into a WPF application.</p>

<p>I have done some research and someone has given me a list of Libraries that I could use avlib, ffmpeg, gstreamer. So I started with the first two and could find ffmpeg however I found people stating that it is better to use libav. But I couldn't find any information on avlib really, is libav a successor to avlib and that is why I can't find it?</p>

<p>Finally all these articles that I were reading were from 2012 as well so I don't know whether there is an even more up to date version. The last release notes for libav were from May this year so my assumption is that this is still being developed.</p>

<p>Any guidance would be really useful as I am not sure where to start looking (even if it is telling me which site would be best to post this on).</p>

<p>When the app starts up, I can tap a bar button item to display a UIActionSheet, and the action sheet displays normally from the bar button item with all the button options and title. However, if I select an action from this sheet, it uses presentViewController to show another very simple view controller, and when that view controller dismisses itself, if I tap on the same bar button item as before I get an action sheet that is not correct. Here is what the action sheet popover looks like:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JwFsU.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The height of the action sheet is correct for the number of options that the action sheet is supposed to have, but it is like the title and all the button text are empty or nil. However, after I create the action sheet, I log the number of buttons and button text for each, and everything looks the same from the first time to the second time.</p>

<p>I am on the latest Xcode and SDK, and the app is targeting iOS 5.0 or newer. Any ideas as to what is going on?</p>

<p>EDIT: Here is some code. There may be some anomalies (syntactical and formatting wise) as I had to chop out a bunch of code that is not pertinent to this issue.</p>

<p>The IBAction for the maintenance button press:</p>

<pre><code>-(IBAction) cmdMaintenance_Click:(id)sender
{
    self.maintenanceActionSheet = [[[UIActionSheet alloc] initWithTitle:@""Title""
                                                       delegate:self 
                                              cancelButtonTitle:@""Cancel""
                                         destructiveButtonTitle:nil
                                              otherButtonTitles:@""Backup"", @""About"", nil] autorelease];
    _maintenanceActionSheet.actionSheetStyle = UIActionSheetStyleDefault;
    _maintenanceActionSheet.tag = MAINTENANCE_OPTIONS;
    NSLog(@""Number of buttons: %d"", _maintenanceActionSheet.numberOfButtons);
    for (int idx = 0; idx &lt; _maintenanceActionSheet.numberOfButtons; idx++)
    {
        NSLog(@""Sheet button %d: %@"", (idx + 1), [_maintenanceActionSheet buttonTitleAtIndex:idx]);
    }

    [_maintenanceActionSheet showFromBarButtonItem:cmdMaintenance animated:NO];
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the action sheet delegate:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)actionSheet:(UIActionSheet*)actionSheet didDismissWithButtonIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex
{
    if(buttonIndex != [actionSheet cancelButtonIndex])
    {
            if(buttonIndex == OPTIONS_ABOUT)
            {
                if(aboutView == nil)
                {
                    aboutView = [[AboutViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""AboutView-iPad"" bundle:nil];
                    aboutView.title = [MyAppDelegate translateString:@""About""];
                }

                [self presentViewController:aboutView animated:YES completion:nil];
            }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And in my About view controller, the Done button code:</p>

<pre><code>-(IBAction)done:(id)sender
{
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT 2: One final note... If I comment out the call to presentViewController with aboutView, the action sheet comes back correctly.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: The question here comes down to this... What in the world could possibly cause the UIActionSheet to show a pop up like what I am seeing? My main view controller has other areas that display a UIActionSheet to ask for user feedback (such as deleting a customer), and these other areas show the same behavior as the Maintenance button, namely a really vertically thin action sheet.</p>

<p>EDIT 4: I put this extra code in my view controller in an attempt to get more information about what is going on (and to attempt to influence the size of the action sheet):</p>

<pre><code>- (void)willPresentActionSheet:(UIActionSheet *)actionSheet
{
    NSLog(@""willPresentActionSheet with frame %@ and bounds %@"", NSStringFromCGRect(actionSheet.frame),
          NSStringFromCGRect(actionSheet.bounds));

    CGRect rect = actionSheet.frame;
    rect.size.width = 400.0;
    actionSheet.frame = rect;
}

- (void)didPresentActionSheet:(UIActionSheet *)actionSheet
{
    NSLog(@""didPresentActionSheet with frame %@ and bounds %@"", NSStringFromCGRect(actionSheet.frame),
          NSStringFromCGRect(actionSheet.bounds));
}
</code></pre>

<p>The attempt to change the frame of the action sheet has no effect of course, and here is the output in the console from the above:</p>

<pre><code>2013-07-15 19:32:58.662 MyApp[12953:907] willPresentActionSheet with frame {{0, 0}, {272, 341}} and bounds {{0, 0}, {272, 341}}
2013-07-15 19:32:58.677 MyApp[12953:907] didPresentActionSheet with frame {{0, 0}, {272, 327}} and bounds {{0, 0}, {272, 327}}
2013-07-15 19:33:08.075 MyApp[12953:907] willPresentActionSheet with frame {{0, 0}, {0, 324}} and bounds {{0, 0}, {0, 324}}

</code></pre>

<p>The first two lines are from when it is working correctly, and as you can see from the second two lines, the width of the action sheet is 0 for some reason.</p>

In many of them the Netflix competition was given as an example. On Netflix users rate movies (from 1 to 5). In that competition, the competitors were given a database of movies and corresponding ratings by the users, and they were supposed to implement a system which would best predict the rating of the movies and using that rating would suggest movies to the users.</p>

<p>For evaluation they suggest cross validation using measures which use the predicted and real ratings as arguments. Predicted rating is calculated using the history of the user and his ratings for the movies.</p>

<p>I am trying to build a news recommendation system. The problem I am facing now is that the news are relevant just for a short time and almost nobody would give a rating to the news. So, I only have implicit feedback (views) and no explicit feedback (rating). Also in the Netflix problem they are provided with a database. I am wondering how to cope with the cold start problem, because at the start no news would be read (viewed).</p>

<p>I will be so thankful if You could suggest me how to avoid the cold start problem and once I will have an algorithm how could I test if it works fine.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>at least not in firefox. It is meant to register event handlers on <code>body</code> for an html5 drag. It should apply some styles to <code>box</code> when you drag over the body, and remove them on dragleave. It should also call <code>convertToMOSTEM</code> whenever a file is dropped. It logs kk to the console, meaning that the code inside the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> was executed. However, it never animates the box or logs kkkkkkkk! to the console when I drag over or leave and when I drop it attempts to open the file. I am pretty sure that the event handlers are never defined. It works in Safari and Chrome. What is the problem?</p>

        [Key]
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public Faculty Professor { get; set; }
        public DateTime CancelledOn { get; set; }
        public Course Course { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public ClassDate ClassCancelled { get; set; }
        public Message CancellationMessage { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public List&lt;Student&gt; Students { get; set; }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>It's mapped from the viewmodel called <code>CancellationFull</code> (with AutoMapper):</p>

<pre><code>public class CancellationForList
{
    [Key]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public CourseForList Course { get; set; }
    public ClassDateForList ClassCancelled { get; set; }
}

public class CancellationFull : CancellationForList
{
    public CancellationFull()
    {
        this.Students = new List&lt;StudentForList&gt;();
    }
    public FacultyForList Professor { get; set; }
    public MessageForList CancellationMessage { get; set; }
    public DateTime CancelledOn { get; set; }
    public List&lt;StudentForList&gt; Students { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the repo method that turns a <code>CancellationFull</code> into a <code>ClassCancellation</code> and then saves it to the database:</p>

<pre><code>    public CancellationFull createClassCancellation(CancellationFull c) 
    {
        ClassCancellation newCancellation = Mapper.Map&lt;ClassCancellation&gt;(c);

        dc.ClassCancellations.Add(newCancellation);
        dc.SaveChanges();

        return Mapper.Map&lt;CancellationFull&gt;(dc.ClassCancellations.FirstOrDefault(cc =&gt; cc.Id == newCancellation.Id));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Why, for the love of god why, does the database create new objects for <code>Faculty</code> and <code>Course</code> when the <code>Id</code> (primary key) of each's existing entity counterpart is provided? It might also be doing the same with <code>Student</code> objects but I haven't looked that closely.</p>

<p>Before the <code>ClassCancellation</code> instance is saved to the database the debugger shows that it's attributes <code>Professor</code> of type <code>Faculty</code> and <code>Course</code> of type <code>Course</code> have the correct primary key - that is, the primary key of the already existing entities of those types that I'm trying to update with a reference to the new <code>ClassCancellation</code> object.</p>

<p>Driving me nuts. Feel free to ask for clarification!</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Here's the logic where the <code>CancellationFull</code> viewmodel is constructed from form data and viewmodels about existing objects retrieved from their respective repos:</p>

<pre><code>     newCancellation = new CancellationFull();
     newCancellation.CancelledOn = DateTime.Now;
     newCancellation.ClassCancelled = repoClass.getClassDateForListById(Int32.Parse(classIds[i]));
     newCancellation.Course = repoCourse.getForList(newCancellation.ClassCancelled.Course.Id);
     newCancellation.CancellationMessage = repoMessage.getMessageForList(newMessage.Id);
     newCancellation.Professor = repoFac.getFacultyForList((int)Session[""facId""]);

     var students = repoStudent.getStudentsForListByCourse(newCancellation.Course.Id);

     foreach ( var student in students )
     {
         newCancellation.Students.Add(student);
     }

     repoCancellation.createClassCancellation(newCancellation);
</code></pre>

<p>Here's an example of one of those repo methods (the rest are very similar):</p>

<pre><code>    public CourseForList getForList(int? id)
    {
        return Mapper.Map&lt;CourseForList&gt;(dc.Courses.FirstOrDefault(c =&gt; c.Id == id));
    }

<p>where _updateUser is exactly the same as updateUser  and still the dataBase is not changed....  this might have something to do with postback but i dont know how that works..

<p>The challenge is to code an app that uses this sensor module.  But I'm not sure what specific API's to use to best architect this implementation.</p>

<p>I've started looking into the <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/cocoaasyncsocket/"" rel=""nofollow"">CocoaAsyncSocket class</a> as it seems to be an appropriate tool for such use.</p>

<p>Does the user always have to manually connect to the adhoc wifi device?  (through the Settings app)  or can my own app handle the searching, making, and breaking of the wifi connection?</p>

<p>I doubt iOS lets me programmatically toggle whether Wifi is on/off.</p>

<p>Once the sensor data is being received, what container would best handle the stream?
For example, on other platforms, I coded a rotating queue buffer.</p>

<p>Thanks for your input.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  The protocol in question is straight CSV formatted ASCII.  Not HTTP, FTP, etc.  Just raw data.  The app is to simply open a port on the connected IP, and read/write.</p>

The overall process almost never fails and is refreshed several times a day.  However, there appear to be some bugs in the calculations that has been handed to me to investigate and fix.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I knew nothing about cubes when this was handed to me, was not part of the original development process, and generic web tutorials don't seem to quite apply to whatever I'm looking at.  On the plus side, trial and error has taught me enough that I can ask a few questions.</p>

<p>The bug is definitely in the calculations.  But I obviously don't want to test in Production and I also don't want to make changes without a proper backup (that I know how to revert). </p>

<p>I logged in on sqlplus as sysdba and run a script that creates a schema (tables, procedures, etc) and it was a success.</p>

<p>I run a simple query: SELECT username FROM all_users ORDER BY username; and was able to see that the username was indeed created.</p>

<p>Now, I went to sql developer and created a connection using the newly created username but I cannot make a connection (making sure that my username, password, hostname, port and sid are correct). I repeated the query to see if I can see the newly created user but it is no longer showing.</p>

<p>So, why do you guys think what happened why I can see the users when I ran a query on sqlplus and not on sql developer? (both queries were run using the sysdba connection)</p>

<p>There are two tables:</p>

<pre><code> 1. users - {id, name, ...}
 2. users_availabiltiy {id, user_id, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday, ...}

[moday, truesday and other days fields are of boolean type]
</code></pre>

<p>So, if a user is available for monday, wednesday and thursday, that will have true as its value and the rest will have value as false.
and there is <code>has_one</code> relation between these two tables.</p>

<p>Now, the problem is, I need a single ActiveRecord query to get all those users which are available on n days [user inputs the days for which users are returned, e.g. if user enter monday, thursday and friday, our system needs to return all those users which are available for any of these days]
Plus we also need to order the result set based on maximum days matching.</p>

<pre><code>[all days matches -&gt; first ranking]
[all days matches-1 -&gt; second ranking] and so on.
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Database is postgresql and rails version is 4.</p>

<p>This is the easiest approach:</p>

<pre><code>input = [""moday"",""tuesday"", ""wednesday""]
b = input.map{|day| day+"" = true""}
c = b.join("" or "")
b1 = a.map{|day| day+""::int""}
c1 = ""*, ""+b1.join("" + "")+"" as total""
User.joins(:user_availabilty).select(c1).where(c).order(""total DESC"")

<p>Can someone let me know the best and optimized approach apart from this?</p>

<p>To be more descriptive with the webapp and the purpose of the expiration, this is the logic:</p>

<p>User 1 gets <strong>site.com/?pic_id=1</strong>, when user get pic_id a reference to that pic and his data related is stored in memcache with a hashvalue and expiration time of 4h to denote that pic_id has been opened and yet not validated, after 1 or 2min the user validates this picture with his data and when is submited the element is removed from memcache. If some user requests the same pic_id while it persists in memcache other pic_id and related data is dispatched. If the user quits browser or requests another pic_id without validating I want that pic_id and his data to be avaiable to another user after 4h..</p>

<p>So my issue is,</p>

<p>I have one thread group with 2 users
and there is a random value created for each user name ie. <code>acc_123</code> and <code>acc_124</code>
Now, I have used <code>bsh.shared</code> to store the variable values in array, so the array <code>my_array</code> has </p>

<pre><code>""my_array : acc_123,
     : acc_124""
</code></pre>

<p>Now the issue is how can these be passed as parameter to next thread group(within <code>http</code> path).</p>

<p>If there are 3 users,I need to pass <code>acc_123</code> for user 1, <code>acc_124</code> for user 2, <code>acc_123</code> again for user 3.</p>

<p>I know a way to do that using <code>CSV</code>, is there any other way?</p>

<p>My question is, what is fork doing in this case?  I know that the child has a complete copy of the process of the parent, but I'm a little confused.  So does that mean that the child process has its own object A which holds the B?  And what happens if B is not waiting, but A deletes the B?</p>

<p>I suppose this is a rather basic Java-Question, but nevertheless: Do I have to include this org.apache.tools.ant-library somewhere? Do I have to ""list"" it somewhere in the grails-configs? Or am I missing something completely else?</p>

<p>Starting it in developer-mode (<code>grails run-app</code>) works fine.</p>

<p>Thanks for your proposals,
Marius</p>

In the first step, I succesfully load the file and using Test::CSV convert the columns of the data into lists, but in doing so, I noted that the length of each list is the number of elements corresponding to the larger column, i.e. for those columns with fewer elements, a blank space is present. This is my code so far:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings;
use strict;
use Text::CSV;

my $csv = Text::CSV-&gt;new({
    sep_char =&gt; ""\t"",
});

open( LIST, ""&lt;"", ""testfile"" ) or die ""No esta el archivo\n"";

    } else {
        my $err = $csv-&gt;error_input;
    }
}
close(LIST);
</code></pre>

<p>The input matrix has 20 columns and between 4500-8500 rows plus a header row (which ideally I would like to use as keys in the hash). For simplicity I build a ""testfile"" with three columns, no header and different number of elements (in the same format as the original input file). Here is the content of testfile:</p>

<pre><code>1 1 2
2 2
  3 4
5 6
6 7
7 8 8

<p>This is the output. I presume that the ""Use of uninitializated value..."" is related to the blank spaces.</p>

"22108482","1","","","2014-03-01 00:38:11","","1","530","<p><strong>The Short:</strong></p>

<p>When I trigger a file upload using SendKeys(path) to a proxy element (placed on by ExecuteScript) that then proxies to my hidden  through the jquery.fileupload plugin, the file uploads fine, but when I try and issue a <code>FindElement</code>, it blocks until the server responds. </p>

<p><strong>The Long:</strong></p>

<p>I am using the 2.4 C# web driver, default firefox driver, and jquery file upload plugin (blue imp).</p>

<p>The flow begins by clicking a button to open an 'overview dialog box', which has my </p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id=""fileUpload"" type=""file"" name=""files[]"" accept=""video/quicktime,video/x-ms-wmv""&gt;
&lt;lablel for=""fileUpload""&gt;Select a file&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After composition of the dialog box, I have</p>

<pre><code>jquery('#fileUpload').fileupload(self.fileUploadOptions);
</code></pre>

<p>Normal usage has the user click the label, which triggers the input, which then triggers and add callback, which checks size/types, and if OK, then changes to a PROGRESS dialog box, and does a <code>data.submit()</code>.</p>

<p>Progress continues until the response, at which time a final dialog box shows some results and can be dismissed with another button.</p>

<p>So, in brief:</p>

<ol>
<li>open a dialog </li>
<li>set template in dialog to intro</li>
<li>select a file</li>
<li>change template in dialog to progress</li>
<li>kick off the ajax (or iframe) upload</li>
<li>change template in dialog to finish</li>
</ol>

<p>Selenium couldn't access the fileUpload input (hidden), so to get Selenium to trigger the file upload, I ended up having to execute some script like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add a new  input element:</p>

<p>jQuery('', {id: 'tmpId', type: 'file', name:'files[]'}).appendTo('modalDivId')</p></li>
<li><p>Trigger a callback:</p>

<p>$('#tmpId').bind('change', function (e) {
    $('#fileUpload').fileupload('add', {
        files: e.target.files || [{name: this.value}],
        fileInput: $(this)
    });
});</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, now after creating the tmpId input element, my selenium script does this:</p>

<pre><code>var path=""\path\to\files"";
var tmpInput = WebDriver.FindElement(By.Id(""tmpId));
tmpInput.SendKeys(path);
</code></pre>

<p>This triggers add callback, checks the file, changes to the template to 'progress', and starts the upload.
Assuming the upload takes 60 seconds, the server will respond and then the template will trigger to 'finish'</p>

<p>The problem is that although:</p>

<pre><code>tmpInput.SendKeys(path);
</code></pre>

<p>returns 'immediately', so I call </p>

<pre><code>var a = WebDriver.FindElement(By.Id(""tmpId""));
</code></pre>

<p>And this BLOCKS until the file upload is complete (60 seconds). Even though the progress bar is updating.</p>

<p>And then returns success.</p>

<p>Because I have this progress template I want to validate, I would really like to access the DOM during the upload.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

I allready tried to hide all elements en change some css settings for the map, but i can't get it to zoom in.(note that i dont have the marker locations globaly) And when i cancel or print, my divs are also gone from the html even if i show() them again.</p>

I need to get this info in my webapp and i do not have access to the sqlserver other than to read the information.</p>

<p>in the docs:Curiously, the ASPStateTempSessions table lacks an AppId column linking it to ASPTempStateApplications. The linkage occurs in ASPStateTempSessions's SessionId field, which doesn't store just session IDs. It stores session IDs with application IDs appended to them. The statement</p>

<pre><code>cmd.Parameters[0].Value = id + _partitionInfo.AppSuffix
</code></pre>

<p>so i have this value in the AspStateTempApplications table:</p>

<pre><code>    appid            appname
    -796116323     /w3svc/*/root/fsco*tbsc 
</code></pre>

<p>i have identified in the session table my session info with the appid converted?</p>

<pre><code>sessionid
cp5p2trw5navwnsgmhdzctnn2341447f 
</code></pre>

<p>the portion at the back: 2341447f should correspond to -796116323 but if i run a hexadecimal convert function it either barfs on the negative sign or using online converters gives me the wrong value. how can i get that value, i would like to query session values </p>

<p>what am i missing here.. it seems straightforward</p>

<pre><code>window.opener.startLoad();

<p><strong>Problem</strong> : I want to initiate a download (in a separate thread, of course) when the <code>DashBoard</code> launches. From there the user can goto <code>Feed</code> or <code>Events</code>, and the download would be in progress or already finished. The activities <code>Feed</code> or <code>Event</code> (which ever appropriate at the instance) should be notified that the download is finished and the data is available. What is the best way to accomplish this?</p>

<p><strong>My current code</strong> : I have a downloader class <code>DownloadHandler</code> which gets initiated by the <code>DashBoard</code> activity. This class downloads on a separate thread. The class keeps track of a boolean called <code>completed</code>. It is instantiated to <code>false</code> and when the download completes it is changed to <code>true</code>. </p>

<p>Currently My classes <code>Feed</code> or <code>Events</code> will poll the variable <code>completed</code> every 100ms or so in a separate thread so it doesn't block the UI thread. and when the <code>completed</code> variable becomes <code>true</code> it calls a function in that specific class which then queries the <code>DataHandler</code> class for the downloaded data. </p>

<hr>

<p>This does work, but I feel like my logic is a bit messy and there must be a better way to do it. Because I am using two separate threads, one for downloading, one for polling the completed variable. Is there a better way to do this?</p>

<p>I have read on <code>AsyncTask</code> and different callbacks, but the problem is I cannot specify a callback in a specific class. Because when the download completes the current activity might be <code>DashBoard</code>, <code>Events</code> or <code>Feeds</code>. There is no guarantee which activity will be in front when the download finishes.</p>

<p>Here's what I'm trying to do. A user inputs a value and I do the following with it:</p>

<pre><code>// Square Input and mod with 65536 to keep it below that value
var squaredInput = (inputVal * inputVal) % 65536;
// Figure out how many bits is the squared input number
var bits = Math.floor(Math.log(squaredInput) / Math.log(2)) + 1;
// Convert that number to a 16-bit number using bitshift.
var squaredShifted = squaredInput &gt;&gt;&gt; (16 - bits);

<p>As long as the number is larger than 46, it works. Once it is less than 46, it does not work.
I know the problem is the in bitshift. Now coming from a C background, I know this would be done differently, since all numbers will be stored in 32-bit format (given it is an <code>int</code>). Does JavaScript do the same (since it <code>var</code>s are not typed)?</p>

<p>If so, is it possible to store a 16-bit number? If not, can I treat it as 32-bits and do the required calculations to assume it is 16-bits?</p>

<p>Note: I am trying to extract the middle 4-bits of the 16-bit value in <code>squaredInput</code>.</p>

<p>Another note: When printing out the var, it just prints out the value without the padding so I couldn't figure it out. Tried using <code>parseInt</code> and <code>toString</code>.</p>

I've followed the tutorial to the letter and I've installed and tested the plugin for Phonegap. Half the time, the error fxn gets called by the Media fxn. The rest of the time, nothing at all happens. What am I doing wrong?</p>

I have tried to create a Fiddle but it just won't work in there, so <a href=""http://savster.byethost4.com"">I've put up a link here to demo what I mean</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/GkGq0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>I have set the <code>height</code> of the <code>div</code> that holds the results to <code>100%</code>. However, it doesn't stretch right down to the fixed footer.</p>

<pre><code>#found-results { 
    height: 100%px;
    margin-bottom: 50px;
    background: #CCC;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also want the green box to stretch down to the footer. The CSS is: </p>

<pre><code>.main {
    width: 606px;
    float: left;
    padding: 15px 0 0 16px;
    position: absolute;
    background: green;
    margin-left: 383px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if I add <code>height: 100%;</code> to it, it seems to work, but if one of the tabs contains a lot of text, it doesn't stretch far enough.</p>

<p>Any help will be much appreciated.</p>

<p>This method is giving me an error ""unable to convert varchar value to int"" and mentioning my item code having a varchar value.  So i tried this way after removing the varchar item code and this method is working when i don't have any varchar value in item code. But I can't keep my item code column as int as I have to give an alpha character in the item code.</p>
