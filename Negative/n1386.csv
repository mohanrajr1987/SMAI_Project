"25452135","1","","","2014-08-22 17:01:10","","0","77","<p>I have a piece of code where I make use of the <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Base-from-Member"" rel=""nofollow"">BaseFromMember</a> idiom to be able to create a proper inheritance relationship for the class I am actually interested in (called <code>Derived</code>). I stumpled upon the fact that it is not possible to access protected (or private) base class types before the body of the derived class. See my code below:</p>

<pre><code>struct BaseFromMember
{
    //protected: // comment/uncomment this line
    using T = int; // using declaration/typedef

  protected:
    BaseFromMember()
      : t_(1)
    {}

    const T&amp; t() const { return t_; }

  private:
    const T t_;
};

template&lt;class T&gt;
class Base
{
  public:
    Base(const T&amp; t)
    {}
};

class Derived
    : private BaseFromMember // private, protected, public doesn't matter here
    , public Base&lt;typename BaseFromMember::T&gt; // this does not work for protected type T
{
    using T = typename BaseFromMember::T; // works

  public:
    Derived()
      : BaseFromMember()
      , Base(BaseFromMember::t())
    {}
};

int main()
{
  Derived d;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As expected, the problem does not depend on the fact which modifier is used to derive <code>Derived</code> from <code>BaseFromMember</code>. </p>

<p>However, <code>Base</code> can only be initialized if the using declaration in <code>BaseFromMember</code> is public, otherwise I get an error with both, gcc (4.8.2) and clang (3.4-1). I consider this behaviour unexpected, especially because <code>typename BaseFromMember::T</code> is accessible in <code>Derived</code>'s body.</p>

<p>I was not able to find any related topic on stackoverflow. I found <a href=""http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmbugs/2014-March/033213.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this thread</a> though, although I am not certain if it addresses the same issue.</p>

<p>Question: Did I do something wrong or do I assume something that should not be assumed? Or this is maybe just a compiler bug?</p>

<p>Note: Even more disturbing to me is the fact that the keyword <code>typename</code> does not seem to have any effect when establishing the inheritance of <code>Derived</code>. Maybe I just did something very silly?</p>

<p>Note: I am not sure if the term <em>initalization</em> is correct in this context as used in the title of this thread. Please let me know if another term would be more appropriate. Of course, I would also like to know if any other terms that I use are inappropriate :).</p>

<p>Now, I am sure that must look like a big hot mess to those who know what they are doing with capistrano, but I am an utter rube. In the end, despite my inadequacies, the deploy seems to work, because when I run the following</p>

<pre><code>cap deploy:setup
cap deploy
</code></pre>

<p>my app is up and running and, just because I can, I add a few rows to a table in the db via the web ui that was created for me by rails.  Now, I get bold and create a migration, adding a column to a table.  I push my changes to git.  To my horror, when I run </p>

<pre><code>cap deploy
</code></pre>

<p>ALL the migrations are run, which recreates the tables, thus destroying all my data.  I have repeated this painful process several times.  My schema_migrations table looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>20130620210004
20130620220229
20130628213331
20130628214946
20130628223002
</code></pre>

<p>What am I missing here? </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  I recently gave @TheMahrvin's suggestion regarding running deploy:migrations at the command line and removing it from the deploy.rb.  It didn't work... once again, all migrations were run. My muse must have whispered something in my ear, because I decided to try running db:migrate on the server itself.  I was astonished to see this output after running just ""rake"":</p>

<pre><code>  20130717230110 CreateHighScores
  20130717230342 CreateGames
  20130717231041 AddGameTypeToGame
  20130717233707 AddGamePublisherToGame
  20130717234124 AddGameRatingToGame
  20130731210558 AddGameMechanicToGame
</code></pre>

<p>Only the last migrations should be pending.  So, perhaps this isn't a problem with Capistrano at all (I've updated the title of this question to reflect that).  So, why are the previous migrations still being flagged as pending?  I know they were run in the past, both because I saw them in the output and verified the db schema after they ran.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE #2:</strong>  Setup another migration and ssh'd into the server and cd'd my way to the ""current"" directory, which if I understand capistrano at all (fat chance) is where the current files are.  Running</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec rake db:migrate:status
</code></pre>

<p>got me:</p>

<p>After doing some research I was referred to using the software PhysicsEditor for you to create unique bodies to use in box2d:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.codeandweb.com/physicseditor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codeandweb.com/physicseditor</a></p>

<p>the software itself is fine to use and I've got all .xml files ready to use and everything in my project set up</p>

<p>I've also been looking at the examples provided here:</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/ANDLABS-Git/AndEngine-PhysicsEditor-Extension-Examples/tree/master/src/org/andlabs/andengine/extension/physicsloader"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ANDLABS-Git/AndEngine-PhysicsEditor-Extension-Examples/tree/master/src/org/andlabs/andengine/extension/physicsloader</a></p>

<p>My problem is I'm not entirely sure where to go from here to begin to detect collisions - I understand how basic box2d collisions work but I have no idea how to use anything created from PhysicsEditor</p>

<p>I'm very new to android programming so I don't quite understand how to use PhysicsEditor in my project and how to use what it's created as bodies that can be attached to sprites and such - (unless it's all included within the loader it's self?)</p>

<p>After I've used the loader (as seen in the example) - what do I do from here?</p>

<p>I can't seem to find any other examples of people using the PhysicsEditor with collisions in their project either so I'm stuck on what to do.</p>

<p>(I've also looked up other alternatives for perfect pixel collisions but they seem even more of a hassle to set up)</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated and an example of a basic project using PhysicsEditor with collisions or some sort of tutorial for dummies would be ideal.</p>

I'm currently evaluating ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ.</p>

<p>The plan is to have 5 different queues, with one being a dead-letter queue.  The number of messages sent per day will be anywhere between 40K and 400K.  As I plan for the message content to be a pointer to an XML file location on a data store, I expect the messages to be about 64 bytes.  However, for evaluation purposes, I would also like to consider sending raw XML in the messages, with an average file size of 3KB.</p>

<p>My main questions: When/how many messages should be persisted on a daily basis? Is it reasonable to persist all messages, considering the amounts I specified above? I know that persisting will decrease performance, perhaps by a lot. But, by not persisting, a lot of RAM is being used. What would some of you recommend?</p>

<p>Also, I know that there is a lot of information online regarding ActiveMQ (JMS) vs RabbitMQ (AMQP). I have done a ton of research and testing. It seems like either implementation would fit my needs. Considering the information that I provided above (file sizes and # of messages), can anyone point out a reason(s) to use a particular vendor that I may have missed?</p>

<p>The query is not very fast (10 seconds) and the problem seems to be the ORDER BY part, without that line the query takes 0.01 seconds, using ASC instead of desc takes about 1 second.</p>

<p>I have created an index with all the fields in the WHERE/ORDER BY-part of the query in the same order as they appear in the Query (field1, field2, field3, field4, field5) but it is not used according to ""explain"" in MySQL.</p>

<p>field1 has rather high cardinality (integer with about 100 different values) field2 and field3 are BOOLEAN and field5 is a string with high cardinality (but LENGTH(field5) > 0 makes the cardinality low, or?).</p>

<p>There is also an index on field5 alone and that is the only index being used when the query looks like above, removing the ORDER BY part of the query will make MySQL use the multi-column index instead.</p>

So currently I have a jQuery prototype that I would like to convert to use Angular.js. For any animations or page transitions I am using css transitions. To change pages I am changing the body class with jQuery which in turn animates elements on or off the page. </p>

<p>In Angular, views are displayed and removed with no animation at all. The way I need it, some views would use some elements from the last view.</p>

<p>For example, There is a start view and a search view that contains a search input field that animates. When the page is loaded, the start view is loaded. When the user clicks submit, it would then load the search view but the search bar should stay there and animate to the top for future searches.</p>

<p>I am somewhat confused as to how to go about doing this. Any suggestions? Thanks.</p>

<p>So if Keywords is a LEADING then we have to remove that from the beginning and if it's a TRAILING then we have to remove that from the end. e.g.-<code>MR Jones MRS COMPANY</code> should return <code>JONES MRS</code> and <code>MR MRS Jones PVT COMPANY</code> should return <code>MRS JONES PVT</code> (As in first iteration MR and PVT will be trimmed and then word will become <code>MRS JONES PVT</code>) It should remove only very first occurrence of the reserve keyword either at the beginning or at the end of the input string so there are multiple occurrence of the LEADING keyword at the begining it should remove only the first one not the others like I gave example above, it is same for TRAILING keywords as well.</p>

However, I don't know how to get data from a Service's thread and then send it to my Activity. I'm a bit confused, do I still need to use Handler? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I have found the solution! Let's sum up. First, declare your Handler inside your Activity and before starting your Service, put some extra data by adding a new Messenger, linked to your Handler.</p>

<pre><code>public class HomeActivity extends ActionBarActivity
{
    ConnectionDetector m_cd;
    Intent m_networkListenerService;

    public Handler m_handler = new Handler()
    {
        @Override
        public void handleMessage(Message msg)  // This is where main activity thread receives messages
        {
            Bundle  bundle;
            if (msg.what == 1)  //  1 MEANS NEW ELEMENT
            {
                bundle = msg.getData();
                System.out.println( bundle.getString(""name""));
            }
            super.handleMessage(msg);
        }
    };

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_home);

        this.m_networkListenerService = new Intent(this, Network.class);
        this.m_networkListenerService.putExtra(""Messenger"", new Messenger(this.m_handler));
        this.startService(this.m_networkListenerService);

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, inside your Service class (you can do the same with an IntentService class), get your Messenger back and send it as a parameter to your Thread class:</p>

<pre><code>public class Network extends Service
{
    NetworkListenerThread  m_networkListenerThread;
    Messenger   m_messenger;

    @Override
    public void onCreate()  {   super.onCreate();   }

    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {   super.onDestroy();  }

    @Override
    public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId)
    {
        if (intent != null)
        {
            Bundle extras = intent.getExtras();
            if (extras != null)
            {
                this.m_messenger = (Messenger)extras.get(""Messenger"");
                this.m_networkListenerThread = new NetworkListenerThread(m_messenger);
                this.m_networkListenerThread.start();
            }
        }
        return Service.START_STICKY;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once again, get your Messenger back into your Thread class:</p>

<pre><code>public class NetworkListenerThread extends Thread
{
    private static final int BROADCAST_PORT = 4415;
    private DatagramSocket  m_socket = null;
    private Messenger   m_messenger; 

    public  NetworkListenerThread(Messenger messenger)
    {
        this.m_messenger = messenger;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Message msg = Message.obtain();   //  Creates a message from the message handler to send it back to the main UI
msg.what = 1;   //  Specifies the type of message
Bundle bundle = new Bundle(1); //  Object of size 1 in which we put the data in
bundle.putString(""name"", name); //  Key + data (which is a String)
msg.setData(bundle); //  Attaches the bundle to the message
try {   this.m_messenger.send(msg); }  //  We use the Messenger from the main thread to send the data 
catch (RemoteException e) { e.printStackTrace();    }

(Environment is Delphi 2010/Win7/DBExpress/MySQL).
Application is to control a real-time sailing event. A ""master"" pc and a ""slave"" (now need 2 slaves!). 
The slave pc's enable sailors to register their details for the event (stored into MySQL tables). The master pc controls a) when registration screen opens/closes, b) sends event details to slaves, c) send real-time race countdown/start and race elapsed times to slaves which they must display and react to (closing registration screen etc). Master needs to know when new person has signed in or out to update it's racelist.</p>

<p>Currently I implemented (my first Indy program) with IDTCPServer on master. IdTCPClient on slave tells master when new SignIn/Out, and continually sends ""time request"" text msgs to server, as I dont know how to send message from a TCPServer!). </p>

I don't quite understand how this works however, by default <code>Object.Equals</code> compares two references for object equality, and seeing as <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> both point to a unique instance of a string, this should return false, which it does in the third example but not in the fourth.<br>
Now I understand why it returns true in the 2nd example seeing as the <code>.Equals()</code> method is overridden in the string class, but in the fourth example we're casting this string as an object.<br>
So wouldn't it call <code>Object.Equals</code> in this case?</p>

<p>The separate script I wrote takes a username/password (and ID) to connect to an Oracle database (using cx_Oracle), gathers the relevant information, generates a PDF and saves it to a preset location. It spits out the location of the filename when it's done.</p>

<p>My thought was to create a django app that takes the following 3 parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Password</li>
<li>ID  (this will be used to determine which records to fetch for the PDF)</li>
</ul>

<p>Django will feed the parameters to the script by calling subprocess. I would put this into my view like so:</p>

<pre><code># ... 
import subprocess

# ...
def login_view(request):
    username = password = ''
    if request.POST:
        username = request.POST.get('username')
        password = request.POST.get('password')
        record_id = request.POST.get('record_id')

        output = subprocess.check_output([
            ""python"", 
            ""myscript.py"", 
            ""-id"", 
            record_id, 
            ""-u"", 
            username, 
            ""-p"",
            password
        ])
        # The output will look like:
        # File /path/to/1234567.pdf saved
        fname = output.split(' ')[1]

        if fname.endswith('.pdf'):
            # Get the filename without the /path/to junk in front
            fname_nopath = fname.split('/')[-1]

            file = open(fname, 'rb')
            content = file.read()
            file.close

            response = HttpResponse(content, mimetype='application/pdf')
            response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename=%s' % fname_nopath

            return response
        else:
            response = HttpResponse(output)
            return response
</code></pre>

<p>I think this method is a little ""clunky"", and I would think there's a more elegant approach to take.</p>

<p>Another way I was thinking about would be to import the external script directly into my views.py file, then call its main function using the username, password, and record ID passed from django. This way I can avoid the subprocess machinery. If needed I can create a separate main() function in the script, have it return a filestring, and use that for both opening/serving the file through django.</p>

<p>The only problem is this interface is going to be used pretty frequently by users. To require them to login every time to generate a PDF report for each record_id is a bit of a pain. Ideally I would like to keep the users logged in (I think I would have to maintain a cx_Oracle cursor separately, and pass that into the script). </p>

<p>My feeling is that this is overcomplicating things. Is there a better way to do this or did I miss something?</p>

From there, I use a VirtualObjectListView component to display the entries (Including the first image as a preview) in Details mode.</p>

<p>The problem I've ran into is that with several hundred+ entries, it starts to eat up ram and I'm seeing <strong>a lot</strong> of files <em>(Lots of duplicates too)</em> open/locked in Process Explorer. So, I've attempted to implement a caching system - where only 30 images are loaded at a time, and ones not needed are unloaded while new ones are loaded.</p>

<p>It doesn't work. It ends up loading multiple copies of each file somehow, and it just feels... Hacky. I've spent the past few days looking for an event or something that I can bind a method to, to do this - but I can't, so I've had to use <strong>GetNthObject</strong> in <strong>AbstractVirtualListDataSource</strong>.</p>

<p>Anyways, here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>public override object GetNthObject(int n) {
    VideoInfo p = (VideoInfo)this.Objects[n % this.Objects.Count];
    p.ID = n;

    int storeBufferHalf = 5;
    int storeFrom = (n - storeBufferHalf &lt; 0) ? 0 : n - storeBufferHalf;
    int storeTo = (n + storeBufferHalf &gt;= Objects.Count()) ? Objects.Count() - 1 : n + storeBufferHalf;

    foreach (int cacheItem in cacheList.ToList()) {
        if (cacheItem &gt;= storeFrom &amp;&amp; cacheItem &lt;= storeTo)
            continue;

        VideoInfo unloadItem = (VideoInfo)this.Objects[cacheItem];
        //Debug.WriteLine(cacheItem + "" Preparing to delete cache: "" + unloadItem.Name);
        unloadItem.DestroyPreviewImage();
        cacheList.Remove(cacheItem);

    }

    //Load up items into cache.
    for (int i = storeFrom; i &lt; storeTo; i++) {
        if (!cacheList.Contains(i)) {
            VideoInfo loadItem = (VideoInfo)this.Objects[i];
            if (loadItem.PreviewImage != null)
                continue;

            loadItem.SetPreviewImage();
            cacheList.Add(i);
        }
    }
    return p;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some more information: Basically, it <em>kind of</em> works... It <strong>does</strong> load multiple copies of each file, it does end up loading more images than it should after you scroll down a bit (The entire test DB of 60 items, actually), BUT scrolling the list up and down a few times gets it to unload the files (At least according to Process Explorer).</p>

<p>After that, it starts loading them all up again, some of them multiple times...</p>

<pre><code>func metaTitleUpdated(input: String) {
    println(""delegate title updated to \(title)"")

    let chunks: NSArray = title!.componentsSeparatedByString("";"")
    if (chunks.count) {
        let streamTitle = chunks .objectAtIndex(0) .componentsSeparatedByString("";"")
        if (streamTitle.count &gt; 1) {
        titleLabel.text = streamTitle.objectAtIndex(1)
        }
    }

}    
</code></pre>

<p>but i always get the error ""Type 'Int' does not conform to protocol 'BooleanType'"" in the line: if (chunks.count) {</p>

<p>What does cause this error? Is the rest of the code in swift correct or are there any other errors?</p>

<p>This returns an exception in Android 5 because ""mBase"" is not found. I cannot find out what the equivalent is on Android 5.  I added ""getDeclaredFields"" to see what values were returned. Attached are screenshots of some of the data in the array returned from ""getDeclaredFields"". I have highlighted with red in the screenshot from Android 4.4 which shows ""mBase"". The other screenshot is from Android 5 and it does not include ""mBase"".</p>

<p>What would be the equivalent for ""mBase"" in Android 5? Or how should I better code this to support both 4.4 and 5?</p>

Puffin renders web site content on its own cloud servers and then passes the result to the user's browser. The downside is that the user's ip address appears as that of the Puffin cloud server and not their own. Puffin does however pass the ""real"" ip address using the X-FORWARDED-FOR header. Unfortunately my host provider strips this out.</p>

<p>Solution 1: Learn Linux.  I could probably write a cron job that looks in the directory to which they're uploading every 5 minutes and then post the files it finds into my site.</p>

<p>Solution 2: Create a timer driven service in grails that looks in the directory every 5 minutes.  This is what I'm going to start trying.</p>

<p>Solution 3: This would be hard, but I'm sure it would be <em>possible</em> to have grails pretend to be a FTP server allowing the ftp dump to be like a post.  I have no idea where to start this solution, so unless there is a plugin this isn't happening.</p>

<p>The flow is there are four tabs, which will be treated as steps for Grails web flow. Clicking on a step it will go to list/search page. The first initial search will have default search parameter values. And at the same time it stores to the scope of execution's active session's scope.</p>

<p>Here is the code snippet.</p>

<p><code>Object res = execution.getActiveSession().getScope().put(beanID, bean);</code></p>

<p>Here <code>execution</code> is a reference of <code>FlowExecution</code>.</p>

<p>Later on this object is been retrieved using active session itself. Below is the code snippet to retrieve data.</p>

<p><code>Object objectFound = execution.getActiveSession().getScope().get(beanID);</code></p>

<p>In both the case <code>beanID</code> is same.</p>

<p>Now what happen to this is, when I put it to the active session, it does not gives error so assuming it is been saved properly. But on retrieving the object in another ajax request, retrieval of object gives null. Means no object found with the key.</p>

<p>Then strange thing happen is, when I perform search operation, same operation been performed as mentioned above. Now on retrieving with the same key it gives object back and not getting null value.</p>

<p>My query is why this is happening? How the web flow works in this case?</p>

<p>I think in both the cases it should give back the object against the key with which it is been inserted.</p>

<p>I implemented these variations using a combination of three methods:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>copying code and making minor changes to the copied version</p></li>
<li><p>subclassing the base algorithm class</p></li>
<li><p>using <code>#ifdef</code>s to switch between snippets of code</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The variations that arise from options 1 and 2 are okay because I can select which variation of the algorithm to run in a configuration file. I can then iterate through different configuration files and keep a record of ""configuration:results"" pairs - keeping these records is very important to my work.</p>

<p>I am currently having a problem with the <code>#ifdef</code>s because I have to compile multiple versions of the code to access these variations, making it much harder to run automated experiment scripts and to keep accurate records of results. The <code>#ifdef</code>s, however, are very useful because if I find a mistake in one copy of the code, then I do not have to remember to correct this mistake in multiple copies.</p>

<p><em>The <code>#ifdef</code>s expand six variations that I created by both copying code and subclassing into 24 total variations (4 variations for each basic variation).</em></p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the best way to allow the multiple variations of the algorithm, which are currently specified by <code>#ifdef</code>s, to be run given a configuration file that specifies which variation of the algorithm to run.</p>

<p>Ideally I would like to compile the code only once and select an algorithm variation at runtime using the config file.</p>

I've got this map set up through Google Maps API and it's for a Wordpress website. The user can add locations using a Custom Post type. There are a lot of locations in close proximities, so I'm trying to use the MarkerCluster to lighten it up a bit. I've never used the MarkerCluster before, so it could be a small thing, too... not sure.
'var mc = new MarkerClusterer(map);' --This draws an error of: ""Uncaught ReferenceError: MarkerClusterer is not defined"" </p>

<p>Any insight? Any help is greatly appreciated!!</p>

<p>How can I do that ? I'm almost sure it requires some minor changes , however I've searched over

Obviously there code all works fine but all I want to add is: when the user selects a photo the form is automatically submitted. heres the current java script I am using to attempt this. </p>

<pre><code>    &lt;form action=""my_upload.php"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"" method=""post"" 
    class=""upload"" name=""upload""&gt;  
    &lt;input name=""image"" size=""30"" type=""file"" id=""file""&gt;  
    &lt;input name=""upload"" type=""submit"" value=""Edit Photo"" id=""upload""&gt;  
    &lt;/form&gt;  
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $('form.upload').on('change', function() {
   document.upload.submit();
   });  
   &lt;/script&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>This does submit the form and takes the user to 'my_upload.php' and normally when the photo is uploaded it appears on the page. However when it is uploaded like this nothing appears at all!! </p>

<p>here is there php script ('my_upload.php') which have slightly edited for storing the photo and design of the page: </p>

"874311","1","","","2009-05-17 10:22:59","","2","375","<p>I'm building a network business model in excel.  A similar model is that of Gawker Media.  </p>

<p>In my model I have a number properties that have some over lap of audience.  Each property attracts users, which in turn affords cross promotional opportunities.  In the case of Gawker they have a series of blogs whose audience will likely read several of their blogs in their network.  </p>

<p>If gawker launched a new blog they're able to direct traffic from their blog network.</p>

<p>Creating a model for a single blog is fairly simple - although the initial assumptions are harder. The next step is to model the network effect. </p>

<p>Excel provides a scenarios manager that allows me to vary the key assumptions in the basic model.  This is almost perfect, I can model the launch of 10 properties, each with different launch assumptions and see the summary.  </p>

<p>Where I need help is figuring out how I can vary the initial number of users for the launch of each property.  In other words, once the network is established, its possible to drive people to any new property launched on the network.</p>

<p>I don't believe the scenario manager will do what I need. </p>

<p>So, I'm wondering if its possible to use the model work sheet as a UDF? The UDF would need to spit out the monthly revenue and unique users given a number of input assumptions.</p>

<p>I would then be able to create my own summary sheet for the 10 properties and using the total uniques for each property get a summary for the network.  This network summary would be used to determine how many people could be driven to the launch of a new property.</p>

<p>In effect, the only difference to the scenario manager is that I need one of my input variables (initial users) to be programmatically generated as a function of the number of people in the network at the time of launch.  </p>

<p>I'm hoping its possible to achieve something along these lines in excel.  I could drop down and create the whole model in Java, but then its much harder to share with business colleagues! </p>

<p>Thanks - Matt.</p>

<p>I'm not asking about the role of <code>self</code> as a language feature of python. My question is squarely on how <code>self</code> gets an instance in Django.  </p>

<p>The repository of which this code a part of is <a href=""https://github.com/ShubhamRathi/Django-ecommerce"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. </p>

<p>I got a problem rewriting some URL. My structure is very simple:</p>

<p>I've tried some rules like:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^site/home/ /site/home.php [L]
</code></pre>

<p>Hoping I get: 'mywebsite.com/site/home/' instead of 'mywebsite.com/site/home.php'</p>

<p>It happens to open the page, but it's not loading any image, css or js.
I'm missing something in the process, just don't know what.</p>

<p>I have others subfolders, but they're subdomains and each one has it own .htaccess so no worries about it.</p>

<p>Do I have to use full path links to load that files?</p>

<p>Extra information: I already have some rewrite on my htaccess, forcing HTTPS for domain and subdomains(wildcard) - maybe the order is messing up</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Using:</p>

<pre><code> RewriteRule ^site/home/?$ /site/home.php [NC,L]
</code></pre>

<p>And using full path links. Working fine!</p>

<p>I have made a new question because this is more general and will perhaps help others.</p>

<p>So essentially, I integrated the Facebook SDK Into Codeigniter as a library.</p>

<p>The SDK requires Json and Curl.</p>

<p>In the base_facebook.php file there is the following code:</p>

<pre><code>    if (!function_exists('curl_init')) {
  throw new Exception('Facebook needs the CURL PHP extension.');
}
if (!function_exists('json_decode')) {
  throw new Exception('Facebook needs the JSON PHP extension.');
}
</code></pre>

<p>If these functions are not available I expect an error to be fired to tell me such. Then I can install the correct packages and continue.</p>

<p>What actually happened is that even when I had error reporting set to E_ALL a blank page was returned.</p>

<p>This made it impossible to debug and after lots of playing I worked out it was because CURL was not installed on my server.</p>

<p>My question is why does codeigniter show blank pages rather than library based exceptions?
Furthermore even if there is an exception in a library why does the rest of the page not continue executing.
Essentially CI is seemingly making the use of exceptions worthless..</p>

<p>COuld anyone advise?</p>

The game's resources are subclassed from a class called 'Resource', which will consist of an ID used to identify the type of resource and a handful of virtual functions. So far the class looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Resource {
private:
    int _id;
protected:
    enum ResourceType {
        TEXT
        , PADDLE

    };
public:
    Resource(int resourceID) : _id{resourceID} {}
};
</code></pre>

<p>In the interest of familiarizing myself with C++11, however, I would like to switch to a scoped enumeration. I'm sure I'm missing something here (the code won't compile, after all!). Faulty revised code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>class Resource {
private:
    ResourceType _id;
protected:
    enum class ResourceType : int {
        TEXT = 0
        , PADDLE
        , BALL
        , BRICK
    };
public:
    Resource(ResourceType resourceID) : _id{resourceID} {}
};
</code></pre>

<p>Given the compiler error I'm receiving (""error: 'ResourceType' does not name a type"" at the line <code>ResourceType _id;</code>), it seems that I may need to prototype my enum class elsewhere, but my attempts have been in vain. Please advise!</p>

<p>I tried using QTextDocument in Html, and alternatively QPainter.</p>

<p>Of course, to make a test and keep things simple, I just ask in Qt to show the report title displayed on top of the document.</p>

<p>Here is the function for the toolbox main frame:</p>

<pre><code>def toolbox_frame(self,MainWindow):
    self.toolBox = QtGui.QToolBox(self.centralwidget)
    self.toolBox.setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(10, 20, 471, 201))

    self.toolbox_page1()
    self.toolBox.addItem(self.page1, """")
    self.toolBox.setItemText(self.toolBox.indexOf(self.page1), QtGui.QApplication.translate(""MainWindow"", ""Page 1"", None, QtGui.QApplication.UnicodeUTF8))

    self.toolbox_page2()
    self.toolBox.addItem(self.page2, """")
    self.toolBox.setItemText(self.toolBox.indexOf(self.page2), QtGui.QApplication.translate(""MainWindow"", ""Page 2"", None, QtGui.QApplication.UnicodeUTF8))
</code></pre>

<p>... the function that holds the first page using QTextDocument with Html:</p>

<pre><code>def toolbox_page1(self):
    self.page1 = QtGui.QWidget()
    self.page1.setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(0, 0, 471, 145))

    html = u""""
    html += ("" &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;b&gt;Title - Build ""
                     ""a Report : page 1.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;"")
    document = QtGui.QTextDocument(self.page1)
    document.setHtml(html)
</code></pre>

<p>and here the function using QPainter:</p>

<pre><code>def toolbox_page2(self):
    self.page2 = QtGui.QWidget()
    self.page2.setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(0, 0, 471, 145))

    sansFont = QtGui.QFont(""Helvetica"", 10)
    painter = QtGui.QPainter(self.page2)
    painter.setFont(sansFont)
    painter.setPen(QtGui.QColor(168, 34, 3))
    x=50
    y=50
    painter.drawText(x, y, ""Title - Build a Report : page 2"")
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, that it just displays the toolbox with the page 1 and page 2, but not the title for both report inside the page 1 and page 2.</p>

<p>What is missing here?</p>

<p>All comments and suggestions are highly appreciated.</p>

<p>it should work like this:
it loads a document with several lines of text ans splits it up at line break. this should be stored in an array and a random line should be displayed on the website. </p>

<p>My first idea was to write the text directly into an array but I thought loading it would be more efficient for the website.</p>

<p>PS: there isn't a error-message like ""Error on this page"" when the browser runs it.</p>

<p>Everything worked a dream until I tried to send large amounts of data (contents of a file) from client to server. If both client and server run on my local machine everything works fine and fast (transfering 1 MB of data takes about 25 ms). </p>

<p>Clarification: Due to buffer size limitations, the maximum amount of data being flushed is 64 KB. I divide the data into blocks no larger than 64 KB. </p>

<p>The problem starts when I try exactly the same thing with local client and remote server (within our corporate network). In that case, a single call to writer.Flush() takes 13 SECONDS (compared to 1 ms in local scenario) which is incredibly slow.</p>

<p>The problem arises ONLY when sending large amounts of data from client to server (although not larger than 64 KB, so not that big). Small chunks are no problem, the other way (server to client) no problem either even with large amounts of data, so the network itself should not be an issue.</p>

<p>Can anyone help? I have no clue ;-)</p>

<p>I tried the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>played around with different buffer sizes</li>
<li>turned off firewalls on both sides</li>

<p>My position is that when doing web development, browser code should be written first and foremost to adhere to the W3C web standards, even though Internet Exploder has the greater market share (anywhere between 51% and 79% depending on who is doing the tracking). My reasoning is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The standards are locked in and all browser developers are moving towards at a minimum, 100% bug free support for all the set standards. Therefore code should be written and tested around Firefox/Chrome/Safari, which are much closer to proper standards support than IE8, then conditional tags should be used in IE to work around its bugs. This is particularly the case seeing as you can use conditional tags to work around IE bugs, but if you try to code in reverse, it's much harder to write hacks to force Firefox/Safari/etc to display the coded-broken HTML/CSS correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>You're future-proofing your web applications if you design for standards seeing as all the browsers are aiming at the same place, standards-wise, which means you won't be among the crowd that then has to repair their application every time a new browser version comes out that is closer to web standards, thus making some of your initial hacks now break the layout.</p></li>
<li><p>Coding something broken to support the larger market share then ""unbreaking"" it for the smaller market share, if you have time, seems like a careless way of approaching a job and suggests that you think that 20% market share is insignificant, which I think is very far from the truth.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My co-developer argues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The different browser companies like to go off on their own tangents and don't really care about the standards anyway, so trying to code for standards is a waste of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Coding to support a minority ~20% market share is not worth the effort as long as the page roughly displays in those browsers in a way that is still usable.</p></li>
<li><p>A browser is a browser is a browser. It's just a viewport for rendering text and I shouldn't be worrying so much about things looking <em>exactly</em> right.</p></li>
<li><p>It's a pain to have to develop in Firefox when he prefers IE8 anyway.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am the one in charge and of course I can say ""this is the way it goes"", but I hate just being a nazi and saying ""my way or the highway""; I think it is better to have the others understand why we're doing something a certain way so that we're in agreement as we proceed and therefore the conventions we're following get stuck to because the reason behind them is appreciated rather than begrudgingly followed.</p>

<p>Can I get some input into this argument?</p>

<p>And In my Contact entity I made variables for each type, I need it in my application because this way is much easier:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @ORM\OneToMany( targetEntity = ""RelationInformations"" , mappedBy = ""objectID"", cascade={""persist""} )
 */
protected $contactInformations;

/**
 * @ORM\OneToMany( targetEntity = ""RelationInformations"" , mappedBy = ""objectID"", cascade={""persist""} )
 */
protected $contactPhone;

/**
 * @ORM\OneToMany( targetEntity = ""RelationInformations"" , mappedBy = ""objectID"", cascade={""persist""} )
 */
protected $contactFax;

/**
 * @ORM\OneToMany( targetEntity = ""RelationInformations"" , mappedBy = ""objectID"", cascade={""persist""} )
 */
protected $contactWebsite;

/**
 * @ORM\OneToMany( targetEntity = ""RelationInformations"" , mappedBy = ""objectID"", cascade={""persist""} )
 */
protected $contactEmail;

/**
 * @ORM\OneToMany( targetEntity = ""RelationInformations"" , mappedBy = ""objectID"", cascade={""persist""} )
 */
protected $contactCommunicator;
</code></pre>

<p>And for example getter for phones looks like:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Get contactPhone
 *
 * @return \Doctrine\Common\Collections\Collection
 */
public function getContactPhone()
{
    if ($this-&gt;contactPhone !== null) {
        foreach ($this-&gt;contactPhone-&gt;toArray() as &amp;$info) {
            if ($info-&gt;getType() !== RelationInformations::TYPE_TELEPHONE) {
                $this-&gt;contactPhone-&gt;removeElement($info);
            }
        }
    }

    return $this-&gt;contactPhone;
}
</code></pre>

    private $id;

 * @ORM\JoinColumn( name = ""rnis_object_id"" , referencedColumnName=""rnct_id"", nullable = false );

/**

<p>I am working with a 3rd party program that I have no control over and I can not change. This program will export it's internal database in to a set of <code>.sql</code> each one with a format of:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO [ExampleDB] ( [IntField] , [VarcharField], [BinaryField])
VALUES
(1 , 'Some Text' , 0x123456),
(2 , 'B' , NULL),
--(SNIP, it does this for 1000 records)
(999, 'E' , null);
(1000 , 'F' , null);

INSERT INTO [ExampleDB] ( [IntField] ,  [VarcharField] , BinaryField)
VALUES
(1001 , 'asdg', null),
(1002 , 'asdf' , 0xdeadbeef),
(1003 , 'dfghdfhg' , null),
(1004 , 'sfdhsdhdshd' , null),
--(SNIP 1000 more lines)
</code></pre>

<p>This pattern continues till the <code>.sql</code> file has reached a file size set during the export, the export files are grouped by <code>EXPORT_PATH\%Table_Name%\Export#.sql</code> Where the # is a counter starting at 1.</p>

<p>Currently I have about 1.3GB data and I have it exporting in 1MB chunks (1407 files across 26 tables, All but 5 tables only have one file, the largest table has 207 files).</p>

<p>Right now I just have a simple C# program that reads each file in to ram then calls <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand.executenonquery.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">ExecuteNonQuery</a>. The issue is I am averaging 60 sec/file which means it will take about 23 hrs for it to do the entire export.</p>

<p>I assume if I some how could format the files to be loaded with a BULK INSERT instead of a INSERT INTO it could go much faster. Is there any easy way to do this or do I have to write some kind of Find &amp; Replace and keep my fingers crossed that it does not fail on some corner case and blow up my data.</p>

<p>Any other suggestions on how to speed up the insert into would also be appreciated.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>I ended up going with the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10013197"">parse and do a SqlBulkCopy method</a>. It went from 1 file/min. to 1 file/sec.</p>

</pre>

<p>and getting the hits as such:</p>

<pre>
>> search.hits

</pre>

<p>and here were the results of the query, displaying the name:</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>and here comes my problem.. when I get the highlights, none were returned:</p>

<pre>
>> search.hits.collect{|x| x.highlight(:name)}
=> [nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil]
</pre>

<p>and even this, doesn't return highlight hits:</p>

<pre>
>> search.hits.collect{|x| x.highlights}
=> [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]

<p>but I do realize this is a security risk -- because the articles are created by users. So, someone could insert script tags (just an example) for the content and link to his article directly in the AJAX API. Thus, I am now wondering what's the best way to prevent such issues. One way would be to encode all non alphanumerical characters from the input, and then decode in JavaScript (and encode again when put in somewhere).</p>

<p>Another option could be to send some headers that force the browser to never render the response of the AJAX API requests (<code>Content-Type</code> and <code>X-Content-Type-Options</code>).</p>

<p>Also, as a double check... the spinner displays a list of numbers (1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, etc) and whichever number is selected is the number I need to use in the calculation. I'm calling the correct value from the spinner, right?</p>

<p>I have a feeling that the problem is in the header with the n0 prefixes but I have no clue how to get rid of them. I removed them from from the body by setting implicitTypes to true but I cannot find a similar setting for the header. I am new to SOAP so any other advice is greatly appreciated. Does anyone have an idea of how I could fix this? </p>

<p>I figured the best way to have some control over the stuff would be to add a second toolbar in ApplicationActionBarAdvisor which would call my thee actions/commands to switch perspectives.</p>

<p>So let's say I create a second ToolBarContributionItem in the fillCoolBar method, which would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>protected void fillCoolBar(ICoolBarManager coolBar) {
    IToolBarManager toolbar = new ToolBarManager(SWT.FLAT | SWT.RIGHT);
    ToolBarContributionItem mainBar = new ToolBarContributionItem(toolbar, ""main"");
    coolBar.add(mainBar);

    toolbar.add(openViewAction);
    toolbar.add(newConnectionAction);

    //Custom perspective switcher bar
    IToolBarManager perspectives = new ToolBarManager(SWT.FLAT | SWT.RIGHT);
    ToolBarContributionItem perspectiveBar = new ToolBarContributionItem(perspectives, ""perspectives"");
    coolBar.add(perspectiveBar);        
}

<p>Any ideas how I can align the Toolbar so it would be on the right side of the window? I'd love to have this position hardcoded.</p>

"28522503","1","","","2015-02-15 02:39:00","","0","248","<p>I want to be set an archetype for a stable JavaFX (Java 8) Maven build that will produce an executable JAR that (<em>always</em>) runs from the command line.  And preferable without needing to build an <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25842559/valid-jar-signature-for-javafx-projects"">UberJar or similar</a>.</p>

<p>When we use the Netbeans '<em>Maven JavaFX</em>' archetype the resultant JAR file following a build runs.  As a project grows we find that sometimes the JAR won't run from the command line.  Some Maven POM edits have been needed to '<em>encourage</em>' the program to run from the command line again.  This applies to Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>This also happens directly with the ZenJava JavaFX archetype, e.g. a project artifactId=xx:</p>

<pre><code> java -jar target\xx.jar
 no main manifest attribute, in target\xx.jar
</code></pre>

<p>This is just from the <code>mavan generate</code> command.  The details of the two archetypes in question are:</p>

<p><strong>zenjava</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>archetypeArtifactId=javafx-basic-archetype</li>
<li>archetypeGroupId=com.zenjava</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>netbeans</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>archetypeArtifactId=javafx</li>
<li>archetypeGroupId=org.codehaus.mojo.archetypes</li>
</ul>

<p>Comparing the resulting POM files shows these that the codehaus.mojo (netbeans) uses these plugins in the build:</p>

<ul>
<li>maven-dependency-plugin</li>
<li>maven-compiler-plugin</li>
<li>exec-maven-plugin</li>
</ul>

<p>Either project runs happily from within Netbeans IDE.  The challenges occur when we want to test on command line.  It isn't really the best look externally when the build looks unstable to outsiders like that.</p>

<p>The questions arising are about what are the requirements to make a JavaFX command-line executable JAR file?  For JDK 8 and beyond.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there an alternative JavaFX archetype available that will build projects with dependent JAR-s and run from the command line?</p></li>
<li><p>What allows Netbeans (<em>say</em>) to execute JAR when the same the built JAR won't run on the command-line?</p>

<ul>
<li>What '<em>magic</em>' does Netbeans be add to the execute step?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What is needed for the zenjava archetype to run ""<strong><code>Java -jar</code></strong>""?</p>

<ul>
<li>The JAR resulting from the follow steps doesn't run on the console.</li>
<li><code>mvn  archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.zenjava -DarchetypeArtifactId=javafx-basic-archetype ... -DartifactId=xx</code></li>
<li><code>mvn install</code></li>
<li><code>java -jar target/xx-001.jar</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What influences the: <code>maven-dependency-plugin</code> and <code>maven-compiler-plugin</code> when building the JAR for bigger projects?  </p>

<ul>
<li>In other words, what assumptions might be being broken a project grows and bind with other JAR files.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Needless to say, the Maven generate and build steps are using the JDK Java environment.  The execution though, <code>java -jar target/xx-001.jar</code>, need to run under the simple JRE (without the JDK). I guess question #4 is a long stretch unless you are  someone who has a <em>biggish</em> JavaFX project and solved this already.   Suggestions welcome.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The presence of the garbage collector
  means that you will usually not worry
  about objects that you no longer need;
  you will simply allow all references
  to those objects to go out of scope
  and allow the garbage collector to
  free memory as required. However, the
  garbage collector does not know how to
  free <em>unmanaged resources (such as file
  handles, network connections, and
  database connections)</em>. When managed
  classes encapsulate direct or indirect
  references to unmanaged resources, you
  need to make special provision to
  ensure that the unmanaged resources
  are released when an instance of the
  class is garbage collected. </p>
  
  <p>When defining a class, you can use
  two mechanisms to automate the freeing
  of unmanaged resources. </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Declaring a destructor (or finalizer) as a member of your class.</li>
  <li>Implementing the   System.IDisposable  interface in your 
  class.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn't understand few things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>""unmanaged resources (such as file handles, network connections, and database connections)"". Whats the big deal about them? How come they are unmanaged? (or) Why can't GC managed these resources?</p></li>
<li><p>What code would we place in finalizer or Dispose() method of the a class and what exactly that code would look like? Some examples using these resources, would be of lot of help.</p></li>

The script executed a PhantomJS script that produced an image file.
Then using more PHP that image file was processed in a certain way.
Problem was that on occasion <code>shell_exec()</code> would hang and cause usability issues.
Reading this
<a href=""https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/11463"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/11463</a>
I learnt that <code>shell_exec()</code> is the problem and switching to <code>proc_open</code> would solve the hanging.</p>

<p>The problem is that while <code>shell_exec()</code> waits for the executed command to finish <code>proc_open</code> doesn't, and so the PHP commands that follow it and work on the generated image fail as the image is still being produced.
I'm working on Windows so <code>pcntl_waitpid</code> is not an option.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is continuously have PhantomJS output something (anything) so that <code>proc_open</code> would read via it's stdin pipe and that way I can time the image processing PHP functions to start working as soon as the target image file is ready.</p>

<p>here is my phantomJS script:</p>

<pre><code>interval = setInterval(function() {
  console.log(""x"");
}, 250);
var page = require('webpage').create();
var args = require('system').args;
page.open('http://www.cnn.com', function () {
  page.render('test.png');
  phantom.exit();
});
</code></pre>

<pre><code>ob_implicit_flush(true);
$descriptorspec = array(
    0 =&gt; array(""pipe"", ""r""),  // stdin
    1 =&gt; array(""pipe"", ""w""),  // stdout
    2 =&gt; array(""pipe"", ""w"")   // stderr 
);

$process = proc_open (""c:\phantomjs\phantomjs.exe /test.js"", $descriptorspec, $pipes);

Standard stuff like <code>GetStockItemByIDRequest</code> and <code>StockView</code> are contained in it.</p>

<p>The problem lies when I attempt to add <code>DataAnnotations</code> by using <code>System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations</code> for some of my <code>Views</code> as such. </p>

<p>I can successfully add the <code>System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations</code> to my Portable Class Library project and can successfully reference it in my Windows Phone 8 app and can even create a new instance of my view as such <code>StockView View = new StockView();</code> within my Windows Phone App BUT if I try to use either <code>Newtonsoft.Json</code> or <code>System.Net.Http.HttpClient</code> by doing something like </p>

<pre><code>HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(""http://myservice.com"");

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>T result = await Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.DeserializeObjectAsync&lt;T&gt;(""{}"");
</code></pre>

<p>ie: where deserialization is involved...</p>

<p>I am faced with the error <code>Could not load file or assembly 'System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations, Version=2.0.5.0'</code>. Which I assume is because it doesn't appear that <code>System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations</code> <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj207211%28v=vs.105%29.aspx"">is supported in Windows Phone 8</a> (but then why can I add it as a reference to my PCL?).</p>

<p>So my questions are, why isn't this error invoked when I create a new instance of these classes directly and secondly how do I work around this? </p>

<p>The users were complaining that when their WebI (business intelligence) report included multiple COST CENTERS in their filter, resulting in a SQL with an ""IN"" include multiple values, the following error was returned:</p>

<pre><code>   [1]: (Error): ORA-01722: invalid number ORA-02063: preceding line from [dbname]
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, for a single COST CENTER, the report worked fine. The interesting part is that I noticed that the following join condition, which to me appears <em>UNRELATED</em>, was negatively impacting the SQL:</p>

<pre><code>accounts_dim_dep.account_id = dw_mgr.fa_trans_fct.depreciation_account_id
</code></pre>

<p>The problem here is that the column on the left, accounts_dim_dep.account_id, is defined in the db as a charchar and the col on the right, dw_mgr.fa_trans_fct.depreciation_account_id, is defined as a number.</p>

<p>When I modified the join condition to convert the number to a varchar...</p>

<pre><code>accounts_dim_dep.account_id 
                       = to_char(dw_mgr.fa_trans_fct.depreciation_account_id)
</code></pre>

<p>...the SQL works regardless of the number of COST CENTERS that are specified in the filter.</p>

<p>Hey folks, here's the portion of the assignment I'm working on now:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A command, with or without arguments, executed in the background using &amp;.<br>
  For simplicity, assume that if present the &amp; is always the last thing on the line.<br>
  Example: vi &amp;<br>
  Details: In this case, your shell must execute the command and return immediately, not 
  blocking until the command finishes. The distinction must be made between
  backgrounding a process that does not need interactive input and one that does, e.g., the
  who command vs. the vi command.<br>
  Concepts: Background execution, signals, signal handlers, process groups, asynchronous
  execution.
  System calls: sigset(), sigaction()
  Signals: SIGTTOU</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we're writing our ""own shell"" in C, and the code I've written up to now is working fine. Here are a few snippets so you can see what I'm doing:</p>

<pre><code>// Check for ampersand
block = (ampersand(args) == 1);
</code></pre>

<p>The ampersand function works and returns properly according to my debug statements. Here is where I'm almost positive I actually have to do the backgrounding code, and I'm looking for help here:</p>

<pre><code>// Wait for the child process to complete, if necessary
  if(block) {
//If this executes, there IS an ampersand, and should be backgrounded
    printf(""Waiting for child, pid = %d\n"", child_id);
    result = waitpid(child_id, &amp;status, 0);
  } else {
  //If this gets executed, there is no ampersand, and should not be backgrounded
    result = waitpid(child_id, &amp;status, 0);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>So now I'm at the point where if I type, say ""ls -l &amp;"" it'll do the ls -l command, and it'll execute that printf statement. So that's good. If I don't put the &amp; in there, it doesn't do the printf. Also good.</p>

<p><strong>Million dollar question:</strong>
Once I hit the printf statement, what should I do at that point? Please note that this is an introductory course, and I don't know much beyond the code I've already written. I mean, I know C, but Unix is very new to me.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance, I'll be around to supply more detail if needed :)</p>

JRuby, watir-webdriver, page-object (which really just delegates to watir-webdriver). I suppose under the hood it's selenium-webdriver that's doing the browser driver interaction in any case.</p>

<p>So far I haven't found a way around ultimately using send_keys which basically sends one key stroke at a time and that's why a huge character string is a pain.</p>

But I found a problem I just can't simply solve. Here are some codes that I think are important:</p>

<p>HEADER</p>

<pre><code>class SpaceMarine
{

public:
...
    SpaceMarine(); // default constructor
    SpaceMarine(std::string name, 
                unsigned int rang, 
                Statystyki&amp; stats, 
                std::auto_ptr&lt;Pancerz&gt; armor, Bron&amp; weapon);

private:

    std::string name_;
    unsigned int ranga_;
    Statystyki* stats_;
    std::auto_ptr&lt;Pancerz&gt; armor_;
    Bron* weapon_;
    Experience experience_;
</code></pre>

<p>just to make it clear : ""Statystyki"", ""Pancerz"" and ""Bron"" are classes that are members of main class SpaceMarine. Project requirements: I have to make one smart pointer (here as auto_ptr).</p>

<p>.CPP</p>

<pre><code>SpaceMarine::SpaceMarine()
{
    name_ = ""John"";
    stats_ = new Statystyki();
    weapon_ = new Bron(); 
    std::auto_ptr&lt;Pancerz&gt; armor_(new Pancerz());


   ranga_ = 0;
}
SpaceMarine::SpaceMarine(std::string name, 
                         unsigned int rang, 
                         Statystyki&amp; stats, 
                         std::auto_ptr&lt;Pancerz&gt; armor, Bron&amp; weapon) 
: armor_(std::move(armor))
{
    name_ = name;
    ranga_ = rang;
    stats_ = stats;
    armor_ = std::move(armor);
    weapon_ = weapon;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, where the problem begins:
This is the part of ""main.cpp"" file:</p>

<pre><code>SpaceMarine SM1;
SpaceMarine SM2(""Azrael"", 3, S2, **P2** , B2);
</code></pre>

<p>// S - Stats, P - armor, B-weapon class</p>

<p>There is problem with this little thingy, called P2, which should be an auto_ptr to armor. I have armor object P2 declared previously. 
I have problem ""merging"" auto_ptr into my constructor. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Also, all advices about improving my code are welcome :)</p>

<p>Ps. My first post here! :D Go easy on me ^^</p>

<p>Here's the final code for future refrence:</p>

            Bron&amp; weapon);

<p>I use JPA 2.0 with hibernate 4.1.7 as provider and H2 as the underlying DB. Everything is run in the Java SE env.</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class Employee {
   @Id
   @GeneratedValue
   private int id;

   @OneToOne
   private ParkingSpace parkingSpace;

   //...
}

@Entity
public class ParkingSpace {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private int id;

   @OneToOne(mappedBy = ""parkingSpace"")
   private Employee employee; 

   //..
}

<p>From what i understand, the compiler is taking the <code>finally</code> code block and moving it to after the compiler generated <code>catch</code> block. Something similar to what we had to do if we wanted to <code>await</code> something in a catch-finally up untill C# 6.0.</p>

<p>I see a couple of things i dont understand:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The compiler is adding a generated <code>catch</code> block (which wasn't
present in my method) in the form of <code>catch (object obj2)</code> and
setting its internal <code>object</code> to the obj2 exception. I dont understand why this is being done.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>finally</code> block which i created no longer exist. Does that mean
that any code which is <code>awaited</code> inside a <code>finally</code> block doesn't
get to ""enjoy"" the guarantees we get from actually putting code
inside such a block?</p></li>

<p>Traversal is the single most expensive computation for my program right now and it prevents large scenes (>2k triangles) from running at acceptable frame rates. I am at a loss as to how it can be performed faster. A simple square with 16 triangles introduces a noticeable frame drop when many rays pass through it at once.</p>

<p>To traverse it I used the concepts provided by the paper at this <a href=""https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/fileadmin/cguds/papers/2011/hapala_sccg2011/hapala_sccg2011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a>, where each thread traverses the following code.</p>

            + ""LEFT JOIN po_part.part where po.id = ?1"")

<p>Now I add a new row using JQuery every time a new value is selected from ""TeachingAssistant"" select list. </p>

<p>Also, there is a delete image which on click should delete that particular row. How can I identify a particular row based on the delete image clicked? For e.g if the delete image for row third is clicked then how can I identify third row and send that to JQuery? For e.g. I want to identify the row on which the delete image was clicked and send it to delete function in JQuery below, using ""this"" does not work, is there any other way to doing this? again this is not a strongly typed view, its dynamic. </p>

<pre><code>The requested URL responded with HTTP code 302
</code></pre>

<p>I realise this is a redirect. What I don't know is why that's all I ever get, or what to do about it to actually get the widget HTML.</p>

<p>The documentation on the API says that to embed the widget using PHP you should do this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    require_once 'Services/Soundcloud.php';

    // create a client object with your app credentials
    $client = new Services_Soundcloud('YOUR_CLIENT_ID', 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET');

    // get a tracks oembed data
    $track_url = 'http://soundcloud.com/forss/flickermood';
    $embed_info = $client-&gt;get('/oembed', array('url' =&gt; $track_url));

    // render the html for the player widget
    print $embed_info['html'];
</code></pre>

<p>I'm running this:</p>

<pre><code>// NB: Fully authorised SoundCloud API instance all working prior to this line
// $this-&gt;api refers to an authorised instance of Services_Soundcloud

try {   
        $widget = array_pop(
            json_decode( $this-&gt;api-&gt;get('oembed', array('url' =&gt; $track_url)) )
        );

        print_r($widget);

    } catch (Exception $e)
    {
        print_r($e-&gt;getMessage());
    }
</code></pre>

<p>where ""track_url"" is actually the URL I get back when asking SoundCloud for a track object earlier in the app using the same API. </p>

<p>I'm not actually sure this URL is correct in the first place, because the track object I get back gives the 'uri' in the form:</p>

<pre><code>[uri] =&gt; https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62556508
</code></pre>

<p>The documentation examples all have a straight <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/username/track-permalink"" rel=""nofollow"">http://soundcloud.com/username/track-permalink</a> URL - but even using a known path to a public track the attempt to run the API oembed method fails... I still get a 302 Exception.</p>

<p>Finally, there are mentions of setting ""allow_redirects"" to false in the 'get' command, but this has no effect when I add to the parameters used to build the query to the API. I also tried adding additional cURL options, but that too had no effect.</p>

<p>I have definitely enabled API access to the track within SoundCloud.</p>

<p>Kind of banging my head off the wall on this. If anyone has any pointers I'd be very grateful to hear them. Just for clarity's sake, I am able to access all the user data, comments etc. via the API instance I have created, so it appears to be working fine.</p>

<p>And my controller code:</p>

    var Group = ""mikes group"";
    try
    {
        if (ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            UserListRepository.AddUserToList(User, Group);
            UserListRepository.Save();
            return RedirectToAction(""AddUser"");
        }
    }
    catch (DataException dex)
    {
        //Log the error (uncomment dex variable name after DataException and add a line here to write a log.
        ModelState.AddModelError(string.Empty, ""Unable to save changes. Try again, and if the problem persists contact your system administrator."");
    }
    return View();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally my user model:</p>

<pre><code>public class UserDetail
{
    public int UserDetailId { get; set; }
    public string ConnectionId { get; set; }
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    public int GroupUserListsId { get; set; }
    public virtual GroupUserLists GroupUserLists { get; set; }

<p>I hope to one day write a tutorial for all this chat system so while I HUGELY appreciate any help in fixing, reasons WHY are just as important.</p>

<p>Basically I am looking for a way to get a date to be saved as a variable in the following format, 22nd October 2014.</p>

<p>This is for a basic insert query, at the moment I am using  date('d-m-y') which produces 22-10-14.</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class Derived&gt;
class ElectricEngine {};
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename Derived&gt;
class GasEngine {};
</code></pre>

<p>Now say I want to make <code>CarEngine</code> and <code>PlaneEngine</code>, each of which can choose one of the above base classes. Also I need to do CRTP (static polymorphism). So a straight forward way to do this are as following:</p>

<pre><code>class ElectricCarEngine : public ElectricEngine&lt;ElectricCarEngine&gt; {};
class GasCarEngine : public GasEngine&lt;GasCarEngine&gt; {};

class ElectricPlaneEngine : public ElectricEngine&lt;ElectricPlaneEngine&gt; {};
class GasPlaneEngine : public GasEngine&lt;GasPlaneEngine&gt; {};
</code></pre>

<p>The above works, but its lot of redundant code, since my methods of each <code>CarEngine</code> types i.e <code>ElectricCarEngine</code> and <code>GasCarEngine</code> are same. Its the same story for <code>ElectricPlaneEngine</code> and <code>GasPlaneEngine</code>.</p>

<p>Assuming something like below compiles :</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename Base&gt;
class CarEngineInterface : public Base&lt;CarEngineInterface&lt;Base&gt; &gt; {};
</code></pre>

<p>We can then reuse this class to create any <code>CarEngine</code> Types by simple typedfs.
For example:</p>

<pre><code>typedef CarEngineInterface&lt;ElectricCarEngine&gt; ElectricCarEngine;
typedef CarEngineInterface&lt;GasCarEngine&gt; ElectricCarEngine;
</code></pre>

<p>However this fails because of the cyclic dependency. How can I achieve a similar effect?</p>

<p>Is there some traits magic to solve this? (Like the ones used to refer Derived class typedefs from base classes in CRTP)</p>

<p>I am on C++99 but I can use Boost. Also I am a noob in c++ templates.</p>

<p>Let me know if I need to clarify anything.</p>

<p>Before my most recent update, I would set up my manager and database and then call <code>initializeQuery</code> the following would have pulled all the docs from the db with their data intact where I could see the documentID and data in each doc (double checking the database I see all the docs are still there and they all have the key <code>type</code> set with a string): (Code posted in Objective C, though seeing similar results with Swift/Android)</p>

<pre><code> - (void) initializeQuery {
     CBLQuery* query = [_database createAllDocumentsQuery];
     liveQuery = query.asLiveQuery;
     [liveQuery addObserver: self forKeyPath: @""rows"" options: 0 context: NULL];
     [liveQuery start];
 }

 - (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context{
     if (object == liveQuery) {

         CBLQueryEnumerator *result = liveQuery.rows;

         NSLog(@""No. 1 - number of rows is %lu"", (unsigned long)result.count);

         for (CBLQueryRow *row in result) {
              NSLog(@""No. 2 - what is each row's doc ID: %@"", row.documentID);
              NSLog(@""No. 3 - what is each row's document %@"", row.document);
         }
     }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Now (since updating to the newest Couchbase Lite) I still get the correct number of rows (on NSLog No. 1), and get all the right docIds (on NSLog No. 2) but each row's document is now <code>(null)</code> (on NSLog No. 3) and all keys/values do not exist. Can anyone explain to me if I need to change something to get my data to remain intact all the way to the end. If so a poor Idaho programmer will owe you a life debt!

<p>In the webAPI controller, we use our own contextProvider, which inherits from breeze's EFContextProvider. See code below:</p>

<pre><code> public class SepaContextProvider : EFContextProvider&lt;CompanyName.BLL.BLDirectDebitContext&gt;
 {
    public MyContextProvider() : base() { }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the generic parameter is a BLDirectDebitContext, which inherits from a DirectDebitContext class defined in the data-access layer:</p>

<pre><code> public class DirectDebitContext : DbContext{
 }
</code></pre>

<p>This way, the entities are validated in the BLDirectDebitContext class by overriding ValidateEntity() so that if this code is called from a desktop application (that don't use webAPI or even breeze), the validation logic does not have to be re-written.</p>

<p>Ideally, we could create EFEntityError objects here and throw a EntityErrorsException. But that would mean referencing breeze.webapi dll in our business layer, which does not sound so good considering the number of dependencies. </p>

<p>Would it not make more sense to split the breeze.webapi dll into different dll's ? Or is it our approach that does not make any sense ? </p>

For example, I've seen the size overhead of a bare <code>Object</code> <a href=""http://www.javamex.com/tutorials/memory/object_memory_usage.shtml"">estimated at 8 bytes</a> in some JVMs.</p>

<p>What I would like to know is whether a typical JVM implementation of the <code>extends</code> relationship introduces incremental size overhead at every level of the class hierarchy. In other words, suppose you have a class hierarchy with N levels of subclasses. Is the overhead of the in-memory representation of a class instance O(1) or O(N)?</p>

<p>I imagine it is O(1) because although the size of some of the hidden fluffy stuff you need to be a Java <code>Object</code> (vtable, chain of classes) will grow as the inheritance hierarchy grows, they grow per-class, not per-instance, and the JVM implementation can store constant-size pointers to these entities in a constant-size header attached to every <code>Object</code>.</p>

<p>So in theory, the overhead directly attached to the in-memory representation of any Java object should be O(1) for inheritance depth N. Does anyone know if it's true in practice?</p>

<pre><code>$(window).bind('popstate', function (e) {
    if (!e.originalEvent.state)
        return;

    LoadContent({ url: e.originalEvent.state.path });
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>LoadContent</code> call simply fills a content pane using ajax. </p>

<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Lets imagine that we start off at <code>page1</code> of my site by browsing to it. <code>LoadContent</code> won't be called since there is no <code>state</code>. Let's imagine that my browsing history is like so:</p>

<pre><code>page1 -&gt; (ajax)page2 -&gt; (ajax)page3 -&gt; (back pressed)page2 -&gt; (back pressed)page1
</code></pre>

<p>When I press the browser's back button to go to <code>page2</code>, everything is fine. However, when I press back again, which should load the content for <code>page1</code>, <code>e.originalEvent.state</code> is <em>null</em>, meaning LoadContent won't be called and so the content will remain the same as on <code>page2</code>. How can I get <code>page1</code>'s content to load when pressing back?</p>

<p><strong>Problem 2:</strong> Imagine we press back from <code>page3</code> to <code>page2</code>, which means we load the 2nd page's content through ajax. Now imagine, we <strong>browse</strong> (ie, put in the URL manually into the browser's address bar) to <code>page3</code> again, and <strong>then</strong> press back again to go to <code>page2</code>. Instead of showing the 2nd page, the browser will instead show just the <strong>ajax results</strong> of <code>page2</code>'s content that we retrieved earlier, so that the rest of the page is not loaded. How can this be fixed?</p>

But for certain scenarios in my application I need to get the most accurate timestamp possible, preferably with tick (=100 ns) precision. Any ideas? </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Apparently, <code>StopWatch</code> / <code>QueryPerformanceCounter</code> is the way to go, but it can only be used to measure time, so I was thinking about calling <code>DateTime.Now</code> when the application starts up and then just have <code>StopWatch</code> run and then just add the elapsed time from <code>StopWatch</code> to the initial value returned from <code>DateTime.Now</code>. At least that should give me accurate relative timestamps, right? What do you think about that (hack)? </p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>

<p><code>StopWatch.ElapsedTicks</code> is different from <code>StopWatch.Elapsed.Ticks</code>! I used the former assuming 1 tick = 100 ns, but in this case 1 tick = 1 / <code>StopWatch.Frequency</code>. So to get ticks equivalent to DateTime use <code>StopWatch.Elapsed.Ticks</code>. I just learned this the hard way.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong></p>

<p>Using the StopWatch approach, I noticed it gets out of sync with the real time. After about 10 hours, it was ahead by 5 seconds. So I guess one would have to resync it every X or so where X could be 1 hour, 30 min, 15 min, etc. I am not sure what the optimal timespan for resyncing would be since every resync will change the offset which can be up to 20 ms. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5vTP6.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As from the x-axis, there is Jan - Dec although some of the months were with 0 amount. My problem now is I only managed to plot a graph with the months with amount. Let's say currently my database have these records:</p>

<p>So basically my graph will only have Jun, Aug and Sep instead of Jan - Dec.</p>

<p>Here is how I set up my line chart:</p>

<pre><code>private void openTotalMonthlyChart() {
    int[] x = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 };

    expensesRenderer.setFillPoints(true);
    expensesRenderer.setLineWidth(2);
    expensesRenderer.setDisplayChartValues(true);

    // Creating a XYMultipleSeriesRenderer to customize the whole chart
    XYMultipleSeriesRenderer multiRenderer = new XYMultipleSeriesRenderer();
    multiRenderer.setXLabels(0);
    multiRenderer.setChartTitle(""Total Monthly Expenses"");
    multiRenderer.setXTitle("""");
    multiRenderer.setYTitle(""Amount"");
    multiRenderer.setZoomButtonsVisible(true);

    for (int j = 0; j &lt; trans_list.size(); j++) {
        multiRenderer.addXTextLabel(j + 1, trans_list.get(j).getDate());
    }

    multiRenderer.addSeriesRenderer(expensesRenderer);

    // Get the component from XML file
    RelativeLayout chartContainer = (RelativeLayout) totalMonthlyView
            .findViewById(R.id.chart_totalMonthly);

            multiRenderer);
    // Adding the Line Chart to the RelativeLayout
    chartContainer.addView(chartOverall);
}

<p>The purpose of this app is to allow user to listen to audio files either by streaming or by downloading files. Audio files are categorized into channels and subchannels. Users can navigate to their desired category and get audio files related to that category and play them.</p>

<p>I have 10000 of audio files each sizing around 10 MB. I want to save the files to a centralized server (online hosting) and consume them in front-end using REST services.</p>

<p>Also, there needs to be a login form. Also, users can subscribe to channels if they are logged in. </p>

<p>As per my research, I know that I can do this by hiring a dedicated server and host files there. For the rest API I plan to use PHP.</p>

<pre><code>app.exe plugin1

<p>will load the host (app.exe) and plugin1. The VS solution is structured such that each plugin has it's own project (hence it's own assembly).</p>

<p>There exists a collection of plugins, some of which have opportunity for re-use of code. So for example <code>plugin1</code> has a method <code>CopyFiles(string fileName)</code> and that same functionality is to be utilised by <code>plugin2</code>. </p>

<p>Now, in a traditional console application one would add a reference to <code>plugin1.dll</code> and by using that namespace go about it's business of re-use. </p>

<p>I am curious if there is a ""MEF"" way, if you will, of implementing this re-use. So, something along the lines of creating an object of <code>plugin1</code> in <code>plugin2</code> by adding an <code>Import</code> attribute to <code>plugin1's</code> exportable interface and letting MEF take care of the rest. Is that possible? And if so, how? </p>

<p>Or is there a better approach that one should take when designing such applications? Bonus voodoo for any pointers to useful learning resources and explanations.</p>

<p>As of now, how I'm doing it is like this.  Users POST data to the server, which does some magic with PDF population, and sends the PDF back to the browser.  We're using the <code>Content-Disposition</code>, <code>Content-Length</code>, and <code>Content-Type</code> headers (I'm assuming) correctly:</p>

<pre><code>Content-Disposition: ""inline; filename=\""some-pdf.pdf\""""
Content-Length: ""1860799""
Content-Type: ""application/pdf""
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any specific reason why Chrome refuses to load these files using the in-browser PDF viewer?</p>

<h1>EDIT:</h1>

<p>It seems as though Chrome doesn't load inline files when POSTing to a server.</p>

<p>Working Example:</p>

<pre><code>var express = require('express');
var fs = require('fs');

var app = express();

app.listen(3000, function() {

    var stream = fs.createReadStream( './some-pdf.pdf' );

    res.setHeader('Content-disposition', 'inline; filename=""some-pdf.pdf""');
    res.setHeader('Content-Length', stats.size);
    res.setHeader('Content-type', 'application/pdf');

<pre><code>'Uncaught SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin ""http://kes"" from

<p>I understand the Same Origin Security Policy but I'm not even calling an iFrame at all, least of all to YouTube!</p>

<p>Here is my relevant JS:</p>

<pre><code>$('#contactSubmit').on(""click"", function(){
  sendMessage();
});

function sendMessage(){
 $.ajax({
    type: ""GET"",
    cache:false,

    displayMessage(msg);
});

function displayMessage(message){
   $(""#contactModalResults"").text(message);
   $(""#contactModal"").modal(""show"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The error results from invoking the sendMessage() function, regardless of the method used to call it.</p>

<p>I should say that this is a template that a client wanted and it's bloated with JS files that I am not familiar with (mostly having to do with animations). I suspect one of them is the culprit.</p>

<p>Here are some things I've tried:</p>

<ol>
<li>I know that when I type...</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>

<p>I see IDs, but cannot seem to access them (in order to say the first half belong in one set, and the second in another set).  <code>rownames(attributes(d)$DMetaData)</code> gives me the indexes, but this looks ugly, and they're factors.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Now, after converting to a dataframe, say d is my dataset, I just say:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>half &lt;- floor(dim(d)[1]/2)
d$train &lt;- d[1:half,]
d$test &lt;- d[(half+1):(half*2),]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>But how can I easily do something like...</p>

<pre><code>meta(d, tag=""split"") = ifelse((meta(d,""ID"")&lt;=floor(length(d)/2)),""train"",""test"")
</code></pre>

<p>...to get a result like:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt; meta(d)
    MetaID Y split
1        0 1 train
2        0 1 train
...      . . ...
100      0 1 test
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, <code>meta(d,""ID"")</code> doesn't work, but <code>meta(d[[1]],""ID"") == 1</code> does, but is redundant.  I'm looking for a whole-vector way of accessing the meta ID, or a generally smarter way of subsetting and assigning to the ""split"" meta variable.</p>

I'm currently working on SQL statement execution in Oracle DB.</p>

<p>When I execute query:</p>

<pre><code>query = 'select * from table'

</code></pre>

<p>everything is going fine, but when I try to execute script:</p>

<p>So from what I've googled, looks like I should use callproc function:</p>

<p>RESOLUTION:</p>

<p>I was frustrated by the syntax and the complexity of callproc and callfunc functions.
I've found good resource: <a href=""http://dbaportal.eu/sidekicks/sidekick-cx_oracle-code-paterns/#part1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dbaportal.eu/sidekicks/sidekick-cx_oracle-code-paterns/#part1</a>
in this link I found all needed info and examples on how to work with cx_Oracle library.</p>

<p>at the end I just needed to modify a bit my code:</p>

<pre><code>cursor.callproc('SIEBEL_DBA.X_DR_DEPLOY', ['1-4NANEI', 'SVE_SIT'])
</code></pre>

<p>and the needed part was done, I didn't need to specify any return type, as script that I'm executing doesn't return any value, it just sets it.</p>

I want to present a modal view on startup if a long init sequence is underway.  I tried presenting a modal view in the App Delegate, but the view doesn't appear until well after the underlying code is already complete.  </p>

<p>MainWindow.xib loads TableViewController, so I put my call to presentmodalview in that View Will Appear with the same result.  I have numerous NSLOG calls so I can watch what is happening but I can't figure out why the view doesn't appear until after both the app delegate and the tableview controller's viewWillAppear finish.  I moved the call to viewDidAppear with the same result.  Here is a code snippet:</p>

<h2>App Delegate:</h2>

<pre><code>- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application {

    // Add the tab bar controller's current view as a subview of the window
    [window addSubview:tabBarController.view];
    [window makeKeyAndVisible];
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:NO];

    // if new version being installed do init stuff
    if ( &lt;needs update code here&gt;) {

        [self.tabBarController presentModalViewController:uncompressView animated:NO];

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried changing <code>presentmodalviewcontroller</code> to <code>[window addSubview:uncompressView.view]</code> without any luck.  </p>

<p>The Update code runs just fine, the problem is the view doesn't appear until both the AppDelegate and the TableView are finished.  I'm not creating any views programatically - all are from Xib's.  I can't figure out where to call the update function to get the view to appear right away.  Any help appreciated. Thank you!</p>

Getting this done in android is pretty simple but I'm breaking my head to do it in swift.</p>

<p>Below is the code I've tried ..</p>

<pre><code>public class DataSet
{
    public var notificationOnOff: Bool!
    public var interval: Int!
    public var alert: String!

    init()
    {
        self.notificationOnOff = true
        self.interval = 1;
        self.alert = nil;
    }

    init (onOff: Bool) {
        self.notificationOnOff = onOff
    }

    init (time: Int) {
        self.interval = time
    }

    init (stop: String) {
        self.alert = stop
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This class implementation couldn't persist the data.
Is this the right way of doing it?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>For example, when I click switch in Settings view controller, I'm setting notificationOnOff like ..</p>

<pre><code>dataset.notificationOnOff = DataSet(onOff: true) // value is set and able to print it
</code></pre>

<p>and using this value in another class like...</p>

<pre><code>if dataset.notificationOnOff
{
 // do some stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>So basically, the value is persisting only within the Setting class but not when I switch to other class.</p>

<p>you will see that after I put in a  ballspawning boolean flag and a secondary procedure that I pass my spawning values was so golden...  i made it a field and it gets set at the end of my iteration and checked before the transverse of the list happens..  whoo hoo!!  soo sweet! </p>

  <p>The value of the Handle property is a Windows HWND. If the handle has

<p>Does it mean that we can set window position only AFTER the creation of its handle? Are setters Top/Left using this handle internally? Thank you for clarification.</p>

Facebook suggests you obtain and access token by passing back the code.</p>

<p>I have been looking for the solution for almost 3 days, I have found several websites (like this one: <a href=""http://caffeinbean.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/hadoop-failed-to-set-setxincludeawaretrue-for-parser-error-and-how-to-resolve-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">Hadoop “Failed to set setXIncludeAware(true) for parser” error and how to resolve it</a>), which suggested add xerces and xalan to maven dependencies. There were also other websites, which suggested pretty much opposite - remove all xerces references from classpath. But non of the suggested solutions is working :(  </p>

<p>I've also tried to put: </p>

<pre><code>System.setProperty(""javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory"", ""com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl""); 
</code></pre>

<p>to my code. But it didn't help either :( </p>

<p>I'm using Apache Hadoop 1.21 as I said and JDK 1.7.0-17.</p>

Calling it the destination implies that it's not also a source.</p>

Then I see the anonymous event handler code fire for <strong>DownloadProgressChanged</strong>, and this is where I have a problem.

<p>I've already added the row indicator in to the query thinking it would help identify the first occurrence of an ItemNumber. I need to have a new column that marks an X if the record is the first occurrence.</p>

In 
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4144371/a-picturebox-problem"">A PictureBox Problem</a>, the 4th answer (from user comecme) tells me to have 2 picturebox, one on top of the other. The only (extra) thing I had to do to make it work with this approach was:  </p>

<pre><code>private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)

}

<p>Where pictureBox2 will be the one on top. </p>

<p>I won't consider this an answer to this problem, because I consider it a workaround (specially because having more than 10 pictureboxes doesn't seem ideal! lol).  That's why I will leave this question opened waiting for a <strong>real</strong> answer to my question.  </p>

<p>So, not working at all (result rectangle on top right of the image). Any of the methods (in this example CORR NORMED) prints the rectangle where the template is located. All the results are far away from being accurate.</p>

<p>So, my question is, does the result of matchTemplate depend on how many different colors/shapes the main image has? 
Would SURF or SIFT help me here?
Do you guys now any function that would help me locate a template into another image?</p>

<p>I have a class (see below) that has an initializer that takes a function, f, which can throw. If f does not throw, then a member variable (self.result) should be set to an instance of an enum that wraps the value that f returns. If f does throw, then self.result should be set to an instance of the enum that indicates the value is absent. At the end of the initializer, self.result should not be nil. I have checked the case where the f does not throw, and the behavior is correct. However, in the case that f does throw, self.result is nil at the end of the initializer (the assert is triggered). If I single-step in the debugger, I see that self.result seems to instantaneously be set and then flashes back to being nil.</p>

<p>(Note: You might suggest I represent the absence of a result as nil, rather than wrapping in the enum. However, I need to model the scenario in which the result of f has not been computed yet, has been computed successfully, or an attemopt has been made to compute the result but it has failed. Hence the enum.)</p>

<p>Have I misunderstood how Swift 2's error handling works? Or, is the compiler/debugger etc. behaving incorrectly?</p>

For example, if I have an abstract automobile and abstract builder methods to create car parts, I should be able to send all 30 of my choices to the Director, have it build the pieces I need, then build my automobile.  Regardless of which car, truck, semi, etc. produced, I should be able to ""drive"" it in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>First problem is most examples hard code property values in to the concrete parts, which I really think should come from a database.  I thought the idea was to send my choices to the Director (from a data source) and have the builder create a customized product based on my data.</p>

<p>Second problem is I want the builder methods to actually create the parts then assign them to the product, not pass strings but real strongly typed product parts.</p>

<p>For example, I want to create a form on the fly by having a Builder manufacture form fields for me, including a label, an input section, validation, etc.  This way I can read the object from my ORM, check out the object's metadata, pass this to my Builder and add the newly created user control result to my web form.</p>

<p>However, every Builder example I find only has hard coded data instead of passing choices from the main code to the Builder and kicking out a customized product.  Everything seems to be a big static case statement.  For example, if I have three parameters with 10 choices each, I don't want to build 30 concrete Builder methods, I want to create only enough to manufacture the properties my product requires, which may be only three.</p>

<p>I am tempted to have the Director exist in the main code only.  There should be a way to automatically determine which concrete builder method to call similar to polymorphism and method overloads (although that is a very bad example) instead of using a case statement within the pattern.  (Every time I need to add a new product type, I will need to modify the existing Director, which is bad).</p>

<p>The way I have my control set up is I have the control itself sized to 50, 20. I then a have panel sized 25, 20 set to dock on the right side. In code within the UserControl itself, anytime the background of the control or the panel that acts as the ""switch"" are clicked, it fires off this code:</p>

<pre><code>    private void toggleClick(object sender, EventArgs e) {
        if (toggleStatus) { // set to ""on""
            this.BackColor = Color.Red;
            this.pnlSwitch.Dock = DockStyle.Left;                
            toggleStatus = false;
        } else { // set to ""off""
            this.BackColor = Color.Green;
            this.pnlSwitch.Dock = DockStyle.Right;                
            toggleStatus = true;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This works great and goes off every time. However, I put my UserControl in a form and tried to tie a click event to this method:</p>

<pre><code>    private void toggleSoundClick(object sender, EventArgs e) {
        MessageBox.Show(""Test"");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>When I click on the background of the control, this fires off and everything works like it should. However, if I click on the panel that acts as the ""switch"", the click event in my form doesn't fire (but the click event in the UserControl itself does, which isn't the issue). I can kind of understand this being something like z-indexing in CSS, but it still baffles me why a click event inside the control wouldn't cause it to fire off.</p>

<p>My question is, how can I get around this type of behavior?</p>

<p><em>edit</em> I also can't integrate the behavior from the click event inside the form into the click event inside the UserControl. I have several of these controls on my form, and all have different behavior depending on which is clicked.</p>

  <p>That would be an interesting statistic. We don't have a simple way to do that right now. However, you might be able to use the GitHub API to get close. You could look through public repositories and compare ""pushed_at"" and ""created_at"" dates to see if there has been any activity. Additionally, you could find repositories with a ""size"" of 0. There's more information on how to find this information, and much more, right here:</p>

<p>I have cells being set with either a dataset item of type System.Double or to the textual value of ""--"" when Is Nothing evaluates to true <code>=Iif(Fields!SLF.Value Is Nothing, ""--"", Fields!SLF.Value)</code>.

<p>I generate seven (7) circles which gets their width and height values from a PHP variable where the max value is 100 and then set these values with inline CSS in pixels.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly a 100 pixel circle is way too small on the desktop version (or should I say in a Media Query starting at around 1200px). So I multiply the input by 4 by using calc() in CSS.</p>

<p>On the other hand a 400px circle is too big for a mobile, so I would only like to multiply the input by 2 there, but then the combination of inline CSS, a PHP variable and media queries is a no go, as far as I know.</p>

<p>So I'm looking for a solution where I can change the variable number I multiply the width and height with based on media queries.</p>

<p>One solution that feels like a hack is device detection. With that I can run a if/else and do this. A another solution I have been thinking about is wether I can create the circles as percentages and not in pixels and then set max-width and max-height to different values in the media queries, but when I tried I got a problem with circles getting ellipse shapes when scaling the browser window. The best solution would be to change the variable it multiplies with based on screen size. Is this a JS job? Or could I maybe generate a SVG on the fly.</p>

<p>My problem with the device detection solution at the moment is basicly that if I resize my browser window on a desktop machine it still multiplies by 4 so my positioning of the circles looks like a mess.</p>

<p>This makes up my structure for the circles. There are 7 of them and a container around. The key is the value I multiply by (4). Can that possibly be changed based on media queries?</p>

I'm creating a gnuplot script file, and then running it from within a java program. I've tried using both Process Builder and building a precess using Runtime.getRuntime().exec(""blah blah...""), and neither have the full capability to work. The funny thing is is that using Runtime to make the process works almost perfectly, as long as the image file I'm creating via gnuplot isn't being saved to a directory without a space in it's name. ProcessBuilder doesn't work at all, however, and gives me the error: ""CreateProcess error=2, The system cannot find the file specified""</p>

<p>It's taken me far too long to figure this stuff out, and so any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>The code I use is here:</p>

<pre><code>File script = new File(""Demo.plt"");    //Script file that outputs to a PNG file

//This works as long as the script file doesn't output to a png with a space in it's filepath
Process aProcess = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(""gnuplot "" + script.toString());
Thread.currentThread().sleep(1000);
aProcess.waitFor();

//This doesn't work at all
ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder(""gnuplot "" + script.toString());
builder.redirectErrorStream(true);
Process process = builder.start();
</code></pre>

<p>And I know that the script works if run outside of Java, regardless of the spaces in the output line. I've even tried using '\ ' (the escape character for a space) and that doesn't work either. In fact, here is the code that I use:</p>

<pre><code>String graphName = ""DemoGraph"";
//Isolate the FilePath
String path = script.getPath();
path = path.replace(script.getName(),"""");
path = path.replace(File.separator, ""\\\\""); //Gets around any parsing errors in filepaths on Windows
path = path.replace("" "", ""\\ "");   //Should get around parsing errors with spaces in gnuplot, but it seems to be irrelevant.

scriptFileWriter.write(""set output \"""" + path + graphName + "".png\""\r\n"");

<p>This error happens at random - it may take a few days to see it or it might happen after a 5 minutes. I cannot understand what causes this and the biggest problem - I don't understand what this error means. What is 'prepared' state? The documentation has no information on this state. From what I saw it has some relation to two-way transactions but I do not use them in my code. I use Session.query and Session.commit.</p>

<p><em>(In this case by multiple I mean, 1 email = 1 attachment, but there are many emails. )</em></p>

<p>I have a script that connects to a mail box and retrieves the emails, it then processes them depending on wether the email is plaintext, or has an attachment.</p>

<p>The plain text parsing works fine, as it's not doing anything really more complicated than using Regex to pull some values out.</p>

<p>The attachment parsing however does not work as intended.</p>

<p>This is a sample case of how I intended it to work</p>

<p>Attachment:</p>

<ol>
<li>Retrieve Emails</li>
<li>Parse attachment email</li>
<li>Take order number from subject</li>
<li>Find the part of the email that has the attachment</li>
<li>Retrieve the part and its file name from dparam's</li>
<li>save inside a folder that's outside the public_html with the order number as folder name</li>
<li>save the location, name and order number its attached to into the DB.</li>
<li>Serve the attachments as downloads to the user once checked if they have sufficient privileges etc</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The problem Im having is, whenever the script is processing more than one attachment email it seems to over write the other attachments.</strong></p>

<p>For example, <strong>Job # 12345</strong> comes in with an attachment (for sake of explaining also called 12345.pdf) this processes through and saves, it then starts on <strong>job 12346</strong> with an attachment called 12346.pdf.</p>

<p>If I go to view these attachments, <strong>job 12345</strong> will have the correct file name and file. (eg a pdf with a work order for 12345)</p>

<p>But if I view the job 12346 the attachment will have the correct name but its contents would be that of another work order. (eg a pdf with a work order for 34568, but with filename 12346.pdf) </p>

<p>And this repeats for any other emails being processed at that time.</p>

<p>From what I can tell there is no easily discernible ""method to the madness"" it doesn't seem to over-write the next email attachment with the previous.</p>

<p>I have included gists of my <a href=""https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ea296e64bff9c90abbee"" rel=""nofollow"">attachment parsing function</a> and <a href=""https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2a8f26985030f3022ad3"" rel=""nofollow"">the attachment saving function</a></p>

Now, I want to find where (which line numbers of each file) in all my source files are the members of gr.serafeim are used. The problem is that I am usually using imports and not the fully qualified names of classes, so searching for ""gr.serafeim"" will only return me the import statements :(</p>

<p>I don't want anything fance, just a quick and dirty solution to find out all the lines containing classes of the gr.serafeim package (an eclipse plugin ?). As an added value, I don't want only the declarations but also the method calls of these function.</p>

<p>Here's an example of what I actually wanted:</p>

<pre><code>// File main.java   
import gr.serafeim.*;
public static void main(String args[]) {
    // Test is a member of gr.serafeim !
    Test t = new Test(5);
    int i=3;
    t.add(i);
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I'd like to get as a return from the previous file would be something like this</p>

<pre><code>main.java: 5: Test t = new Test(5); 
main.java: 7: t.add(i); 
</code></pre>

<p>If the previous can't be done, then I could also go with a way to massively name qualify all my classes. So the statement</p>

<pre><code>Test t = new Test(5);
</code></pre>

<p>would become</p>

<pre><code>gr.serafeim.Test t = new gr.serafeim.Test(5);
</code></pre>

<p>and then I'd just grep for gr.serafiem. This of course won't help in finding the t.add(i) line but would be a good first step and I could go from there checking the code myself ...</p>

Right now I'm working on the shop. I've made it so it selects a certain amount of goods in each category (weapons, armor, etc.) depending on the size of the city (village, town, city, etc.) by using arrays to store the variables. That's worked awesome.</p>

<p>What I now want to do is make a list of each item I want the shop to potentially sell, then randomly pick one of those items for each of the slots the store will sell. For example, at the smallest city size, the shop sells two weapons. It will randomly pick two weapons from the weapon list to show the player. I've been using includes as an easy way to store ""lists"" like this, so all I really need to do is find a way for the game to randomly pick x amount of items from a list provided by an include and store it in a variable in an array.</p>

<p>Bonus points if you're able to make it so randomly picking the items is never the same item. (like if we're picking two items and the items were ""Iron Sword"", ""Steel Sword"" and ""Dragon Sword"" or something, it never will say ""Iron Sword"" and ""Iron Sword"")</p>

<p>Here's my code excerpts so far.</p>

<p>Decide how many items to show. (Where the ""Iron Sword""; is shown is where the variables are going to be stored. These were dummy items thrown in.)</p>

<pre><code>$Weapons = 2 * $citysize;
$Armor = 2 * $citysize;
$Misc = $citysize;

include 'weapons.php';

if ($Weapons == 2){
    $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][0] = ""Iron Sword"";
    $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][1] = ""Everwood Staff"";
} elseif ($Weapons == 4){
    $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][0] = ""Iron Sword"";
    $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][1] = ""Everwood Staff"";
    $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][2] = ""Steel Sword"";
    $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][3] = ""Balsa Wand"";
} elseif ($Weapons == 6){
    $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][0] = ""Iron Sword"";
    $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][1] = ""Everwood Staff"";
    $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][2] = ""Steel Sword"";
    $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][3] = ""Balsa Wand"";
    $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][4] = ""Steel Dagger"";
    $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][5] = ""Balsa Bow"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Show the items in the shop</p>

<pre><code>echo $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][0] . ""&lt;br&gt;"";
echo $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][1] . ""&lt;br&gt;"";

if(($_SESSION[""citysize""] == ""town"") || ($_SESSION[""citysize""] == ""city"")){
    echo $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][2] . ""&lt;br&gt;"";
    echo $_SESSION['ShopWeapons'][3] . ""&lt;br&gt;"";
}

if($_SESSION[""citysize""] == ""city""){

<p>So, with:</p>

<pre><code>TABLE entity

TABLE entity_type
  -- entity_type_id (INT pk)

  -- person_name (TEXT)
  -- person_age (INT)

TABLE building
  -- entity_id (INT fk)
  -- age_built (INT)
</code></pre>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>what if I wanted to query all entities, and in my result set get all person-specific columns (<code>person_name</code>, etc.) if the record was a person and <code>age_built</code>, etc. if the record was a building? I thought about storing the subtype table names in the type table but understand you can't dynamically reference those like that.</p>

<p>Am I being an ignorant DB newb here or is this in any way possible without explicitly defining the join and doing a query for each subtype table?</p>

<p>I'm asking this because elsewhere in my DB I'm going to have a lot of references to an <code>entity_id</code> (that could be any kind of entity) and I don't want to run an initial query to just to check its type first.</p>

<p>Background info: We are to develop a website with a drag and drop GUI with possibilites to connect data sources with data manipulations to perform on that specific data. The GUI should be generic and possible to integrate with upcoming products. This means that we cannot code to an implementation in the presentation layer. Instead we will use an interface to define what kind of data manipulations that are possible for all kinds of products. However, each product might also sport product specific data manipulations (thus extending the interface with more methods).</p>

<p>The problem I have with the scenario above is that I dont see how we could pass on these ""product specific data manipulations"" to the GUI and say that, in addition to the generic interface, we also possess these data manipulation actions...</p>

<p>Now I had a discussion with some of the more experienced programmers from the company and they told me that there is a common solution to this problem - more specifically known as the ""Observer pattern"". They draw something like <code>[1]</code> on the whiteboard and explained that it would be possible to ""register"" to a third party (getApplicationContext) that in turn could convey our product specific interface. This is a common problem to get rid of those nasty circular dependencies, they explained.</p>

<p>I have now had a look on the observer pattern and how it works and I still dont really get how I am supposed to solve the design problem. Could someone possibly try to explain how it would turn out in my specific scenario? I have no real problem understanding how it works with ""subjects"" and ""observers"".</p>

<p>Here is an UML diagram of the design where we are using a reference of the specific product. This is what is undesirable and something we would like to get around.</p>

<p>(maybe I got this all wrong...)</p>

The keyup event calls a function, creditCardTypeFromNumber(num), and the credit card type is supposed to be detected. Unfortunately, the only thing that is returned is 'UNKNOWN' no matter what value is typed in. I've used 6011 (discover), 5155 (MasterCard), and 4147 (Visa), none of which works.</p>

<p>I used the RegEx of each Credit Card type from the post here:</p>

<p>As far as I can see, if lost of notifications is acceptable - it is OK to call <code>notify_one</code> not protected (by mutex for example).</p>

<p>For instance, I saw following usage patterns (sorry, don't remember where):</p>

<pre><code>{

        lock_guard&lt;mutex&gt; l(m);
        // do work

<p>and <a href=""https://github.com/ooPo/gcc-4.7.0-PS3/blob/5d9addb08be92a040b8a8675c9e5a231ce37d705/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/std/condition_variable"">condition_variable_any::notify_one</a>:</p>

{
    lock_guard&lt;mutex&gt; __lock(_M_mutex);
    _M_cond.notify_one();

<p>And here is layout of condition_variable_any:</p>

<pre><code>class condition_variable_any
{
    condition_variable _M_cond;
    mutex _M_mutex;
    // data end

<p>I.e. it is just thin wrapper around condition_variable+mutex.</p>

<p>So, questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it thread-safe to not protect <code>notify_one</code> by mutex for either <code>condition_variable_any</code> or <code>condition_variable</code>?</li>
<li>Why implementation of condition_variable_any uses additional mutex?</li>
<li>Why implementation of <code>condition_variable_any::notify_one</code> and <code>condition_variable::notify_one</code> differs? Maybe <code>condition_variable::notify_one</code> requires manual protection but <code>condition_variable_any::notify_one</code> doesn't? Is it libstdc++ bug?</li>

<p>PS: after a debugging session with Spring, I found the explanation of this problem: bridged methods that are introduced at compile time by the compiler. Please see my own answer to this question..</p>

<p>Here is a sample source code replicating the issue (simplified version of real code).   </p>

<p>import java.beans.BeanInfo;
import java.beans.IntrospectionException;
import java.beans.Introspector;
import java.beans.MethodDescriptor;
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;</p>

<p>public class MethodMasking {</p>

<pre><code>public interface HasId&lt;ID extends Serializable&gt;  {
    void setId(ID id);
    ID getId();
}

public interface Storeable extends HasId&lt;Long&gt; {}

class Item implements Storeable {Long id; String code;
    Item(Long id, String code) { this.id = id; this.code = code; }
    public Long getId() { return id; }
    public void setId(Long id) {this.id = id;}
}

public static void main(String[] args) throws IntrospectionException {
    final BeanInfo beanInfo = Introspector.getBeanInfo(Item.class);

    java.lang.System.out.println(""BeanInfo:methodDescriptors:"");
    final MethodDescriptor[] methodDescriptors = beanInfo.getMethodDescriptors();
    for (MethodDescriptor methodDescriptor : methodDescriptors) {
        java.lang.System.out.println(""\t""+methodDescriptor.getMethod().getName());
    }

    java.lang.System.out.println(""class:declaredMethods:"");
    final Method[] declaredMethods = Item.class.getDeclaredMethods();
    for (Method declaredMethod : declaredMethods) {
        java.lang.System.out.println(""\t""+declaredMethod.getName());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
Output of the program:  </p>

<pre><code>BeanInfo:methodDescriptors:
    hashCode
    wait
    getId
    notifyAll
    equals
    wait
    wait
    toString
    setId
    notify
    setId
    getClass
class:declaredMethods:
    getId
    getId
    setId
    setId
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'm confused:<br>
why in beanInfo there are 2 methods descriptors for setId but only one for getId ?<br>
why in declared method there are 2 methods for getId and 2 methods for setId ?  </p>

<p>While debugging I have these methods signatures when using the getDeclaredMethods :  </p>

<pre><code>[0] = {java.lang.reflect.Method@139}""public java.lang.Long MethodMasking$Item.getId()""
[1] = {java.lang.reflect.Method@446}""public java.io.Serializable MethodMasking$Item.getId()""
[2] = {java.lang.reflect.Method@447}""public void MethodMasking$Item.setId(java.lang.Long)""
[3] = {java.lang.reflect.Method@448}""public void MethodMasking$Item.setId(java.io.Serializable)""
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:
After some tests I have found that the cause of the problem is the usage of generics in the HasId interface...  </p>

<p>Declared this way, the problem disapear: no more duplicate methods.</p>

<pre><code>public interface HasId  {
        void setId(Long id);
        Long getId();
    }

    public interface Storeable extends HasId {} 
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I am experiencing is that when printing the image on a printer with a dpi of 203, the edge of the bars are blurry. I assume this is caused by the dithering on the pritner as the image is trying to print between 2 of the dots on the print head.</p>

<p>I have tried scaling the barcode before generating the image, but this has no effect.</p>

   };

}

private void On_PrintPage(object sender, PrintPageEventArgs e)
{
    e.Graphics.ResetTransform();

}

private DrawBarcode(IElement labelElement, Graphics graphics)
{
    float xTranslate = (labelElement.X/96)*Dpi - ((hardMarginX/100)*Dpi );
    float yTranslate = (labelElement.Y/96)*Dpi - ((hardMarginY/100)*Dpi );

    //Call to baroode library
    Image barcodeImage = labelElement.GetBarcodeImage((int) ((labelElement.Width/96)*Dpi ), (int) ((labelElement.Height/96)*Dpi ));

    graphics.TranslateTransform(xTranslate, yTranslate);
    graphics.DrawImage(barcodeImage, new Rectangle(0, 0, barcodeImage.Width, barcodeImage.Height));
    graphics.ResetTransform();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>IElement</code> object is just a class which holds information about the location and size of an element which will be printed on the label.</p>

<p>I thought that generating the with the size <code>(labelElement.Width/96)*Dpi</code> where <code>Dpi = 203</code> would have solved the problem. Before this change the dpi was always 300 as this is what GDI uses as its units. This change has not helped in the barcode image clarity and has caused problem where the elements are not appearing where they should.</p>

<p>Is there anyway I can print clear images (specifically barcodes) on a 203 dpi printer from the <code>PrintDocument</code> class?</p>

<p>I want to implement multi-threading which is based upon <strong>Producer-consumer</strong> approach for an image processing task. For my case, the <code>Producer</code> thread should grabs the images and put them into a <code>container</code> whereas the consumer thread should extract the images from the <code>Container</code> thread. I think that I should use <code>queue</code> for the implementation of <code>container</code>. </p>

<p>I want to use the following code as suggested in this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/31188999/2386113"">SO answer</a>. But I have become quite confused with the <strong>implementation of <code>container</code></strong> and putting the incoming image into it in the <code>Producer</code> thread.</p>

<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> The image displayed by the first <code>consumer thread</code> does not contain the full data. And, the second <code>consumer thread</code> never displays any image. May be, there is some race situation or lock situation due to which the second thread is not able to access the data of queue at all. I have already tried to use <code>Mutex</code>.</p>

I am wondering what is the best way to share the NSURLSession object? One possible approach was to create it within the App's delegate and have View controllers obtain the delegate and schedule a task and I could either return the task or implement a callback whenever the data is finished downloading to share that with the caller. I am unsure what if this is a good approach, I would appreciate some feedback and suggestions thanks.</p>

One from leading and other from trailing, and put the elements in a <code>Queue</code> on each iteration. But before putting the value in <code>Queue</code> I need to check for existence of the value within <code>Queue</code> (its when that one of the threads has putted that value in <code>Queue</code>), So when this happens I need to stop the thread and return list of traversed values for each thread.</p>

<p>This is what I have tried so far :</p>

    main_path.put(i)

g=['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l']

t1 = ThreadWithReturnValue(target=a, args=(main_path,g))
t2 = ThreadWithReturnValue(target=b, args=(main_path,g[::-1]))
t2.start()
t1.start()
# Wait for all produced items to be consumed
print main_path.join()
</code></pre>

<p>I used <code>ThreadWithReturnValue</code> that will create a custom thread that returns the value. </p>

<p>And for membership checking I used the following function :</p>

<pre><code>def is_in_queue(x, q):
   with q.mutex:
      return x in q.queue
</code></pre>

<p>Now if I first start the <code>t1</code> and then the <code>t2</code> I will get 12 <code>a</code> then one <code>b</code> then it doesn't do any thing and I need to terminate the python manually! </p>

<p>But if I first run the <code>t2</code> then <code>t1</code> I will get the following result:</p>

<pre><code>b
b
b
b
 ab

ab
b

b
b
 b
a
a
</code></pre>

<p>So my questions is that why python treads different in this cases? and how can I terminate the threads and make them communicate with each other?  </p>

   &lt;myelement&gt;This is a value I want to retreive&lt;/myelement&gt;
   ....
   ....
 &lt;/factfind&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, I want to use the following template (something like it)</p>

<pre><code> &lt;xsl:template name=""get-my-element"" match=""myelement""&gt;
   &lt;!-- somehow retreive the value 'This is a value I want to retrieve' --&gt;
   &lt;xsl:value-of select=""$this""/&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I know I could match a template on <code>&lt;factfind&gt;</code> but the problem is I already have a template that is matching that element and handling it in its own way. If I make two templates that handle the one node, only the first one is called.</p>

<p>So you might know the context a bit better, here is how I have it setup atm.</p>

<pre><code> &lt;xsl:template match=""loggedin""&gt;
   &lt;div id=""entities""&gt;
      &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=""entities""/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id=""nav""&gt;
      &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=""menuitem""/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id=""content""&gt;
      &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=""factfind"" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The menuitem template would like to make a call-template to the get-my-element template to access the information inside of it, without effecting the behaviour of my factfind template. </p>

object A {
    def a() = ""AAA""
}
</code></pre>

<p>webapp/index.jade</p>

<pre><code>- import test.A._
= a()
</code></pre>

<p>Disable jetty's auto-reload</p>

<pre><code>class TestProject(info: ProjectInfo) extends DefaultWebProject(info) {
    override val scanDirectories = Nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then start jetty:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; sbt
&gt; jetty-run
&gt; ~prepare-webapp
</code></pre>

<p>Visit home page:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8080/
</code></pre>

<p>It displays correct:</p>

<pre><code>AAA
</code></pre>

<p>Then I modify the <code>test.scala</code> as:</p>

<pre><code>package test

object A {
    def a() = ""AAA#######""
}
</code></pre>

<p>Visit page again, correct:</p>

<pre><code>AAA#######
</code></pre>

<p>Then modify the method name:</p>

<pre><code>package test

object A {
    def b() = ""AAA#######""
}
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>index.jade</code> invoke <code>b()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- import test.A._
= b()
</code></pre>

<p>Visit again, show error:</p>

<pre><code>Server Error: We're sorry, but something went wrong.
We've been notified about this issue and we'll take a look at it shortly.
</code></pre>

<p>From this sample we don't know where is wrong, but in my another project, we can see the reason: Failed compiling index.jade, value <code>b()</code> is not found</p>

<p>So I have to restart jetty:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; jetty-restart
</code></pre>

<p>Visit again, and everything goes well.</p>

<p>How to fix this issue, or is there any other way to work with scalate without restarting?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>After nearly 1 week of trying, I have to give up. I tried all the solutions I can find, but it still can't be compiled without restart.</p>

<p>Now, I just run sbt without jrebel, and let jetty reload the webapp when classes are modified(not monitor scalate views). For now, it takes 3 to 5 seconds, which is not too long.</p>

<p>Finally, thanks for @James' help</p>

I can workaround the problem by moving the expression onto a separate line.  But I'd still like to know for curiosity's sake why it didn't work inside the macro.</p>

<p>I think I've followed the async example from vows <a href=""http://vowsjs.org/#-writing-asynchronous-tests"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vowsjs.org/#-writing-asynchronous-tests</a> and substitued the appropriate calls, but I must be missing something.</p>

<p>The test code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var http = require('http'),
    vows = require('vows'),
    assert = require('assert');

vows.describe(""homepage"").addBatch({
  ""Get the home page"": {
    topic: function() {
      http.get({'host': ""127.0.0.1"", 'port': 5000, 'path': '/'}, this.callback);
    },
    'should respond with 200 OK': function(res) {
      assert.equal(res.statusCode, 200);
    }
  }
}).export(module);
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following error when I try to run the test for this:</p>

<pre><code>/Users/&lt;home_folder&gt;/node_modules/vows/lib/vows.js:80

<p>I can get a simple http example to work on it's own. I can get the vows example to work on it's own but I can't combine them for whatever reason. I'd really appreciate some help here. I've been trying to get this to work for a while now (including much googling).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Apparently adding an error argument to the call back solves this problem, thanks to help from Alexis Sellier (creator of vows).</p>

<p>But I have no idea why. When writing out the http lib example on it's own no error argument is required. I can't find any documentation in vows to indicate why it's needed so I'm at a bit of a loss.</p>

<p>My new question is why is the error argument required when using the http lib in vows?</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Enter email on home page</strong> ==> If email is valid, new Signup record is created, and user is redirected to step 2; if email is not valid, new Signup record is not created and home page is re-rendered for user to resubmit email</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enter rest of signup information</strong> (let's just say zipcode) on edit signup page ==> If the zipcode is valid, the Signup record is updated and the user progresses to the rest of the website, else, this edit signup page is re-rendered with errors for the user to resubmit zipcode</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are two separate validations for the same signup, once on the home page to make sure the email is valid, once on the edit page on the update action to ensure the zipcode is valid. </p>

<p>(Why this troublesome two-step? Users might be too intimidated to enter in their information at step 2, but I at least want to capture their interest via their email on my mailing list to reach out in the future.)</p>

<p>I'm running into very annoying problems, represented by these flows:</p>

<p><em>Example 1</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Enter invalid email on home page ==> No Signup record is created, home page is re-rendered with errors</li>
<li>Enter valid email on re-rendered home page ==> New Signup record is now saved (I checked in console), BUT instead of allowing user to progress to the edit signup page, the home page re-renders with the error messages saying that zipcode is invalid. </li>
<li>If user somehow has patience to click submit again without changing the email... then they're redirected correctly to the edit signup page... but understandably users get frustrated before this point and don't click again</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Example 2</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Enter valid but bizarre email on home page (e.g., t@bizafre.com) ==> New Signup record is now saved, BUT again instead of allowing user to progress to the edit signup page, the home page re-renders with the error messages saying that zipcode is invalid</li>
<li>Again as above, if user has patience to click submit again without changing the email... then they'r redirected correctly</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems that the zipcode validation is somehow triggering in the creation step, but I really don't understand why... I have a theory in a comment on the controller code regarding parameters, but a theory that I don't have the answer for either.</p>

<p>Help appreciated!</p>

<p>I am openign a word document via c# / COM Interop (Word 2007).  I want to prevent the Macros from Running as some of them may crash (older files with missing bookmarks etc.).</p>

This does not happen if Eclipse is not running, so I can confidently say that Eclipse is the problem.</p>

public class Booking {

   private Long bookingId;
   private String title;
   private String contact;

   @ManyToOne

   private Event event; 

   public DiveBooking() {
      // for JPA
   }
   // Getters and setters omitted for brevity
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EventRepository:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public interface DiveEventRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Event, Long&gt; {

List&lt;Event&gt; findByStartBetweenOrEndBetween(
        @Param(""start"") Date startStartTime,
        @Param(""end"") Date startEndTime,
        @Param(""start"") Date endStartTime,
        @Param(""end"") Date endEndTime);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>BookingRepository</strong></p>

<pre><code>public interface BookingRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Booking, Long&gt;{

}
</code></pre>

<p>These expose the endpoints:</p>

<p>/rest/events
/rest/bookings</p>

<p>An instance of an event as:</p>

<p>/rest/events/1 </p>

<p>with its bookings:</p>

<p>/rest/events/1/bookings</p>

<p>What I'm trying to achieve, is to create a new booking and have it associated with an event. My data model has event_id as a required field (as a booking is meaningless without an event), and every fibre in my being says that I should be able to <strong>post</strong> a new booking object to /rest/events/1/bookings and have it create a new booking object that is associated with event with id 1.  However, whenever I try and post to that URI, I get the message: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 405
  (Method Not Allowed)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When inspecting the headers for the endpoint /rest/events/1/bookings I can see that post is allowed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access-Control-Allow-Methods:POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now I'm completely confused and at a loss.  It feels like I should be able to create a booking this way, and I really don't want to go down the route of having to create an orphaned booking then associate it with the event as it would break my data model (having to make event_id null in booking), and there is no way to do those to operations inside a transaction (is there?).  I've tried doing similar operations on other collections in my model, and they have post denied too, so I'm guessing it's something to do with my spring data rest configuration, but I don't know what.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help or pointers on this.</p>

<p>Great.  So far, it's totally framework-free.  Now I'd like to expose this as a Yii component, so it can be lazily-instantiated and easily used by Yii controllers and other Yii components.</p>

<p>But Yii components (which implement IApplicationComponent) must have exactly zero constructor arguments, while my class requires one!</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Here's what I've got.  I'm not really happy with any of them; they both look over-engineered and I'm detecting a distinct smell from them.</p>

<p><strong>Option 1 - compose</strong>:  I create a class called ""AccountServiceComponent"" which implements Yii's IApplicationComponent.  It cannot extend my AccountService class, because of the constructor, but it could instantiate one as a private member and wrap all of its methods, like so:</p>

<pre><code>class AccountServiceComponent implements IApplicationComponent, IAccountservice
{
  private $_accountService;

  public __construct() {
    $this-&gt;_accountService = new AccountService(new UserRepository());
  }

  public getUserById($id) {
    return $this-&gt;_accountService-&gt;getUserById($id);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Cons</strong>: I'll have to wrap <em>every</em> method like that, which is tedious and could lead to ""baklava code.""  Especially considering that there'll be multiple service classes, each with multiple methods.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2 - mixin</strong>: (Or behavior or trait or whatever it's called these days.)</p>

<p>Yii (having been written prior to PHP 5.4) offers ""behaviors"" in the form of a class which implements IBehavior.  I could create a behavior class which extends my service, and attach it to a component:</p>

<pre><code>class AccountServicesBehavior extends AccountService implements IBehavior
{
  // Implement the few required methods here
}

class AccountServiceComponent implements IApplicationComponent
{
  public function __construct() {
    $accountService = new AccountService(new UserRepository());
    $this-&gt;attachBehavior($accountService);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Cons</strong>: My component no longer officially implements IAccountService.  Also seems to be getting excessive with the layering.</p>

<p><strong>Option 3 - optional constructor parameters</strong>:</p>

<p>I could just make the constructor parameter to my service class optional, and then extend it into a component:</p>

<pre><code>class AccountService implements IAccountService
{
  public $userRepository;

  public function __construct(IUserRepository $userRepository = null) {
    $this-&gt;userRepository = $userRepository;
  }

  public function getUserById($id) {
    return $this-&gt;_userRepository-&gt;getById($id);
  }
}

class AccountServiceComponent extends AccountService implements IApplicationComponent
{
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Cons</strong>: The optional constructor parameter means this class coudld now be instantiated without supplying it with everything it needs.  </p>

<p>...so, any other options I'm missing?  Or am I just going to have to choose the one that disturbs me the least?</p>

Even though request_mem_region is successful the console during booting shows this messages.</p>

<p>The service basically executes an AsyncTask that does some work and then does something else in onPostExecute().</p>

<p>The service works as expected when I run and debug it in a (virtual) device.</p>

<p>But in the test extending ServiceTestCase, I only get into doInBackground(). Once the methods returns, onPostExecute() never gets called. I am letting the test sleep() so the AsyncTask has time to complete its work.</p>

<p><strong>This is the simplified service:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class ServiceToTest extends Service {
    private AtomicBoolean busy = new AtomicBoolean(false);

    @Override
    public IBinder onBind(final Intent intent) {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public int onStartCommand(final Intent intent, final int flags,
        final int startId) {
        this.handleCommand();
        return START_NOT_STICKY;
    }

    /**
    * Workaround for http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=12117

    public void handleCommand() {
        new TaskToTest().execute();
    }

    public boolean isBusy() {
        return busy.get();
    }

    private class TaskToTest extends AsyncTask&lt;Boolean, Void, TestInfo&gt; {
        @Override
        protected void onPreExecute() {
            busy.set(true);
        }

        @Override
        protected TestInfo doInBackground(final Boolean... args) {
            return null;
        }

        @Override
        protected void onPostExecute(final TestInfo info) {
            busy.set(false);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>An this is the test for it:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class ServiceTest extends ServiceTestCase&lt;ServiceToTest&gt; {
    public ServiceTest() {
        super(ServiceToTest.class);
    }

    public void testIsBusy() throws InterruptedException {
        startService(new Intent(""this.is.the.ServiceToTest""));  
        ServiceToTest serviceToTest = this.getService();
        assertTrue(serviceToTest.isBusy());
        Thread.sleep(10000);
        assertFalse(serviceToTest.isBusy());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I suppose that the environment provided by ServiceTestCase is somewhat limited so this doesn't work, but is there anything I can do to make it work anyway?</p>

"5588129","1","","","2011-04-07 21:55:34","","1","427","<p>Well, the problem is how to organize assemblies for several <em>WCF</em> services hosted in the same domain, when the services might use different versions of the same referenced assemblies?</p>

<p>The thing is, that I have a series of <em>WCF</em> services which are currently hosted in the same domain, but the burden of updating one of these services is overwhelming due to the fact that I cannot be sure not to break other services when doing so. Therefore, it requires that I bring all other services up-to-date with the new version of assembly or assemblies which  I am going to publish.</p>

<p>Updating the service - in my case - would be do change one or more assemblies in the <em>bin</em> folder. The problem is that other services might need the same assemblies. I would like to have the possibility of defining subfolders with the name of the service, and in each of these folder have a <em>bin</em> subfolder, the <em>.svc</em> file and all other stuff related to the service. This way I could isolate the service on the same domain.</p>

<p>I have searched for a solution and I have found a blog post by <em>Scott Hanselman</em> about probing, but it seems to apply to <em>.NET 1.1</em>, <em>ASP.NET</em>...</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4d0ef4fb-f8ae-4355-a658-3c0432c98dbe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4d0ef4fb-f8ae-4355-a658-3c0432c98dbe</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I cannot make it work for my scenario (<em>.NET 4.0</em>). Furthermore, I am not sure that this would scale the way I need. Even if I could make it work, then is it going to be seperate <em>AppDomains</em>, and if not would that be a problem? I need the complete isolation of the service, but still being hosted in the same domain.</p>

<p>Thanks, Jacob.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Actually, I got a bit further. I tried to put the <em>[ServiceName].svc.cs</em> and the interface into its own project and compile it, and then change the <em>.svc</em> file slightly to reference the assembly just created as described by <em>Hanselman</em>. If I leave out the <em>Import</em> statement also mentioned in his post and doing the other bits aswell, then it actually works.</p>

<p>The only thing is if I have a list of paths, something like...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;runtime&gt;
    &lt;assemblyBinding xmlns=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1""&gt;
        &lt;probing privatePath=""Tasks\bin;Products\bin""/&gt;
    &lt;/assemblyBinding&gt;
&lt;/runtime&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... then can I be sure that the assemblies used are from the right folder, and not resolved in the order they appear in the list? An example could be if the <em>ProductsService</em> uses the same assembly as <em>TaskService</em> but in a different version, then if the assembly is resolved in the order they appear in the <em>privatePath</em> string above then it would use the wrong assembly I guess?

<p>If I am right in this assumption, then perhaps strong-naming is the answer?</p>

<p>Checking the list with static type is also easy, like:</p>

class DerivativeOne : BasicClass { }
class DerivativeTwo : BasicClass { }

// in main:

<p>PS2. I am aware that the solution to the problem would be just to put some attribute to BasicClass and make each derivative to have unique value of the attribute, but still - I'm not looking for another route to solve the problem, I'm just interested if it's possible to do it ""this"" way.</p>

The current version is a package based on Eclipse Galileo and it works fine both as a builder application and as a target platform. </p>

<p>Now I want to upgrade it to Indigo and I need some help here.</p>

<p>First, the old method of unpacking number of zips to form a target platform does not work.
(I used Platform Runtime Binary, Delta pack, PDE Runtime Binary and JDT Runtime Binary - a set that I came up with that can be used both as a builder and as a target platform). </p>

<p>Ok, there is new target definition for that. 
<strong>How would I configure it so that it corresponds to my Galileo set up?</strong> 
(And of course I wouldn't mind if it was simpler/cleaner).</p>

<p>I tried the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Added Eclipse RCP, Eclipse RCP Plug-in Developer Resources (for source), PDE/API Tools Environment from download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/3.7</li>
<li>Added Eclipse Java Development from download.eclipse.org/releases/indigo</li>
<li>Downloaded delta pack manually from download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.7-201106131736/download.php?dropFile=eclipse-3.7-delta-pack.zip, unpacked it and added the resulting directory (as Directory) to target definition. <strong>By the way, is there an update site for Indigo delta pack?</strong></li>
<li>Added a couple of third party plug-ins from Eclipse Orbit p2 site: download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops/R20110523182458/repository</li>
</ol>

<p>I then used the definition's 'Set as Target Platform' - and my project builds fine in my workspace - that's nice! 
Then I exported the platform to . 
Now, if I try to execute my build like this:</p>

<pre><code>java -jar &lt;target-platform&gt;\plugins\org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.2.0.v20110502.jar -application org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner -buildfile &lt;target-platform&gt;/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.build_3.7.0.v20110512-1320/scripts/productBuild/productBuild.xml -Dbuilder=&lt;pdebuild-folder&gt;

<p>or even</p>

<pre><code>java -jar &lt;target-platform&gt;\plugins\org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.2.0.v20110502.jar
</code></pre>

<p><strong>I get the following error:</strong></p>

<p>it works fine...but when i use this same method([self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];) to go to home i have to press twice...
and also when i press  - (IBAction)goto2:(id)sender again after coming from goto2Controller
crash is happened..error also ""Pushing the same view controller instance more than once is not supported""
any solution?
i have in my viewdidload as</p>

The problem is my understanding in the DataMapper part, specifically if some data have <code>m:n</code> relationship via a connection table (in case of SQL).</p>

<p>In this case I have a Domain Object:</p>

<pre><code>class UserGroup extends DomainObject {
    public $title;
    public $description;    
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now in my understanding, I would get an Object this way:</p>

<pre><code>$userGroup = UserGroupMapper::instance()-&gt;findById(42);
$userGroup-&gt;title = 'Foo';
$userGroup-&gt;description = 'Bar';
UserGroupMapper::instance()-&gt;save($userGroup);
</code></pre>

<p>Am I on the right way, right now?</p>

<p>So here comes the problem:</p>

<p>I have 3 Tables:</p>

<p><em>core_users</em></p>

<pre><code>id | etc 
</code></pre>

<p><em>core_usergroups</em></p>

<pre><code>id | title | description
</code></pre>

<p><em>core_usergroups_dependencys</em></p>

<pre><code>usergroup_id | user_id
</code></pre>

<p>Basicly, the goal is, to find all Users which are in a specific group (or the inverted way)</p>

<p>The first thing, which comes to my mind:</p>

<pre><code>$userGroup = UserGroupMapper::instance()-&gt;findById(42);
$userCollection = UserGroupMapper::instance()-&gt;findUsersByGroup($userGroup);
</code></pre>

<p>The DataMapper knows 2 tables and 2 Domain Objects, but this doesn't feel right, does it?</p>

<p>I don't understand the Service Part of DDD. According to it (in my understanding) I would write</p>

<pre><code>UserGroupService::instance()-&gt;findUsers($userGroup);
</code></pre>

<p>But in this case the service need an own Data Mapper. Why shouldn't I call</p>

<pre><code>UserGroupDependencyMapper::instance()-&gt;findUsersByGroup($userGroup);
UserGroupDependencyMapper::instance()-&gt;findGroupsByUser($user);
</code></pre>

<p>I generaly dont understand the mapping for dependency. A DataMapper should everytime return an object instance or a collection of object instances of the same type. But here, the mapper could return either a user or a group.</p>

<p>So, what is the way I should go for such a common problem? Bonus: What should my service do in this Example?</p>

<p><strong>Update to Clarify</strong></p>

<p>My question is not about working with the data in Domain Driven Design. It is about how can i fetch a list of data in m:n relation without fetching all. How should the Interface look like?</p>

<p>Basicly i need this according to the DataMapper pattern:</p>

<pre><code>select * from core_users
join core_usergroups_dependency on core_users.id = core_usergroups_dependency.user_id
where core_usergroups_dependency.usergruop_id = 42
</code></pre>

<p>But where would the Call <code>findUsersByUserGroup($myGroup)</code> Call be located? UserMapper?</p>

<p>If i have that Mapper or how ever we will call this, which part knows about it? The Domain Repository?</p>

<p>I created an example to illustrate:
<a href=""http://codepen.io/harryfino/full/jphis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepen.io/harryfino/full/jphis</a></p>

<p>This example works fine in Chrome and IE10, but in Firefox you won't see the transitionend event fired on the second click. Then on the third click, it will fire twice and both elements will be hidden. If you comment out the <code>page.removeClass('is-animating')</code> line, it fires the event properly.</p>

<p>Back story on the removing <code>overflow: hidden</code>: the actual code has divs that overflow out of the containers and cannot be hidden.</p>

<p>I want to know why it's not firing the event on the second click, and as a bonus, why the <code>overflow: hidden</code> is effecting that.</p>

<p>I have another .htaccess in /home/siteID/ with some security rules</p>

<p>Recently I've implemented some rules to protect/obscure a little the path to the wordpress login (yes, I know, obscurity is not really security...):</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/wp\-login\..*
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} .*secret_code=.*
RewriteRule ^.* /wp-admin/ [cookie=secret_code:true:mysite.com:3600:/,R,L]

RewriteCond %{HTTP_COOKIE} !\bsecret_code\b

RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^logout/(.*)
RewriteRule ^wp-login\.php /index.php [R,L]

<p>I placed these rules inside the first .htaccess (the wp ones), and works.</p>

<p>Logically, because are security codes, I want to put these rules not in this file, but in the second .htaccess (that which is located in /home/siteID/). When I try it, does not work, rules doesn't apply. Even with this previous mod_rewrite rules:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
...
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>1) What should I change in these rules to achieve my goal?</p>

<p>2) Do you think maybe that the rules can be simplyfied or improved?</p>

<pre><code>init(id: Int) {
    let movieURL = NSURL(string: ""http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/\(id).json?apikey=\(apiKey)"")!

    NSURLConnection.sendAsynchronousRequest(NSURLRequest(URL: movieURL), queue: NSOperationQueue()) { (response, movieData, error) -&gt; Void in
        var movieJson = NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(movieData, options: NSJSONReadingOptions.MutableContainers, error: nil) as? [String: AnyObject]

        self.id = self.idFromMovieJson(movieJson)
        self.title = self.titleFromMovieJson(movieJson)
        // ...

        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), { () -&gt; Void in
            self.delegate!.movieDidDownload(self)
        })
    }        
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I instantiate a Movie object with a correct id, everything goes as expected. This is what I've written in another class:</p>

<pre><code>var movie = Movie(id: 771351912)
movie.delegate = self

func movieDidDownload(movie: Movie) {
    println(movie.title)
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the output:</p>

<pre><code>Optional(""Interstellar"")
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I try to instantiate a Movie object inside a for-loop like this:</p>

<pre><code>let ids = [771351912, 771380953, 771041011, 13863, 12490, 771311818, 771321699, 11691]
for id in ids {
    var movie = Movie(id: id)
    movie.delegate = self
}
</code></pre>

<p>The print results are not very encouraging: </p>

<pre><code>Optional(""Super 8"") 
Optional(""Interstellar"") 
Optional(""Pulp Fiction"")
nil 
Optional(""The Nightmare Before Christmas"") 
nil
nil
Optional(""Nightcrawler"")
</code></pre>

<p>Worst of all, the println() output is different each time I build and run my code:</p>

<pre><code>Optional(""Interstellar"")
Optional(""Pulp Fiction"")
Optional(""Super 8"")
Optional(""Nightcrawler"")
Optional(""The Nightmare Before Christmas"")
nil
nil
nil
</code></pre>

<p>I even tried to create different NSOperationQueues with different names to use in the NSURLConnection.sendAsynchronousRequest() method but that didn't work out too:</p>

<pre><code>var queue = NSOperationQueue()
queue.name = ""\(id)""
</code></pre>

<p>I guess that the problem is related to the fact I'm sending too many requests at the same time. I've placed <code>sleep(1)</code> in the ids for-loop and it actually prints the movie titles properly.</p>

<p>Does anybody know how to asynchronously make multiple requests inside a for-loop?</p>

<pre><code>var Remote = function(elem, options) {

    this.elem = elem;
    this.$elem = $(elem);

// I'd like to put this object into path.js

The issue is that the recommended <a href=""https://gist.github.com/rcorreia/2362544"" rel=""nofollow""><code>drag_and_drop_helper.js</code></a> didn't allow us to catch a bug in our application because it directly fires the <code>drop</code> event. </p>

<p>With HTML5 drag and drop it is important that you <code>preventDefault()</code> on the <code>dragover</code> event in order for the <code>drop</code> event to fire properly. The issue was that this <code>preventDefault()</code> was accidentally removed and broke the drag and drop of the application, but selenium was not able to catch this because the simulated drag and drop continued to work normally.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to simulate drag and drop that would have allowed catching this issue?</p>

<p>I have <code>ExpandableListView</code> which each has two children. They're created in the same activity as i want to do the Intent with data from children. The problem is i don't know how to retrive children data.</p>

<p>This is the method which gives the children the data.</p>

<pre><code>private void displayContacts() {
    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; namesmails = getNameEmailDetails();
    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; namesphones = getPeopleWithNumbers();
    listDataHeader = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
    listDataChild = new HashMap&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt;&gt;();
    int counter = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i&lt;namesmails.size();i = i+2) {
        //namesmails[0] == name &amp;&amp; namesmails[1] == phone &amp;&amp; namesmails[2] == email
        String name = namesmails.get(i);
        String mail = namesmails.get(i + 1);
        String phone = returnNumber(namesphones,name);
        listDataHeader.add(name);
        List&lt;String&gt; currentName = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
        currentName.add(phone);
        currentName.add(mail);
        listDataChild.put(listDataHeader.get(counter), currentName);
        counter += 1;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to create mail intent, so the <code>currentName.get(1)</code> from <code>listDataChild</code> is the recipient of the mail (let's say for example: <code>example@example.org</code>).</p>

<p>For this I have created a method:</p>

<pre><code>public void sendMail() {
    //This function is called out on the list_item click!
    Intent mailIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SENDTO); // it's not ACTION_SEND
    mailIntent.setType(""text/plain"");
    mailIntent.setData(Uri.parse(""mailto:"" + HERENEEDSTOBEADDRESS));
    mailIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
    startActivityForResult(mailIntent,1);
    setResult(RESULT_CANCELED, mailIntent);

}
</code></pre>

<p>And gave in <code>list_item.xml</code> <code>onClick</code> value:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextView
    android:id=""@+id/lblListItem""
    android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
    android:textSize=""17dip""
    android:paddingTop=""5dp""
    android:paddingBottom=""5dp""
    android:paddingLeft=""?android:attr/expandableListPreferredChildPaddingLeft""
    android:onClick=""sendMail()""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How could i get the data to <code>sendMail()</code>?</p>

<p>A bit additional information. I'm trying to display contacts in the <code>ExpandedListView</code> in which the name is a header and e-mail and phone are children of certain element thus each list item is created dynamically according to the size of users contacts size. If e-mail is clicked <code>list_item.get(1)</code> then the <code>sendMail()</code> is launched and Intent is triggered to send mail.</p>

I don't know if this is the best way to do it, but it works except for one issue. I have the content divs (absolutely positioned in CSS on top of each other), but I also have a navigation div (absolutely positioned in CSS at the bottom of the page) that should always remain on top. So I have this javascript code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt; 
var z = 1;
function showHide(id) {
document.getElementById(id).style.zIndex = z++;
document.getElementsByTagName('nav').style.zIndex = z++;
}
&lt;/script&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>And I have this html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""1a"" class=""content"" style=""z-index:1;""&gt;Content&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""1b"" class=""content""&gt;More Content&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""1c"" class=""content""&gt;Even More Content&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=""nav"" style=""z-index:2;""&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""showHide('1a')""&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""showHide('1b')""&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""showHide('1c')""&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the z-index line for the navigation div messes it up. Not only does it not execute, but anything I put after it doesn't get executed as well (even a basic alert). If I change navigation from a class to an id, it works fine, but I'm going to have multiple navigation divs on each page (multiple slides in a SlideDeck). I could just set the navigation div's z-index to 99999, but I wanted to see why it wasn't working in the ""cleaner"" way, since it looks like I might be making a basic mistake.</p>

"15675279","1","15676585","","2013-03-28 06:06:11","","0","3077","<p>I've followed the tutorial for Zend Framework 2 and I see on the rendered form that the convention for binding the label is to wrap the input element in the label tags as opposed to using the 'for' attribute.  While the tutorial didn't cover it, I deduced (correctly) that the attributes array allows for setting a class on the input element itself but what I <em>really</em> want to do is apply a class onto the label defined under options.</p>

<p>Here's an example used in the tutorial (from <code>AlbumForm.php</code>):</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;add(array(
    'name'       =&gt; 'title',
    'attributes' =&gt; array(
        'class' =&gt; 'required', // &lt;- I added this
        'type' =&gt; 'text',
    ),
    'options' =&gt; array(
        'label' =&gt; 'Title',
    ),
));
</code></pre>

<p>That will render as this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label&gt;&lt;span&gt;Title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;input name=""title"" class=""required"" type=""text"" value=""""&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Optionally, I could live with having the class applied to the span tag but I'd prefer to use the class on the label and then use css child selectors for the span and input elements</p>

<p>I've re-read the tutorial plus the comments on the appropriate section and even dug into the Zend\Form API documentation itself and I don't see how I could apply a class attribute to the label in declaring a form element in this manner.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another minor nitpick with form rendering is that it appears to be rendered inline with no line breaks between form elements.  I've gotten around this by adding a line break in the view scripts (<code>add.phtml</code> and <code>edit.phtml</code>) like so:</p>

<pre><code>echo $this-&gt;formRow($form-&gt;get('title')) . ""\n"";
</code></pre>

<p>However, this seems like a pain to have to do with every echoed form statement within the view and using the <code>formCollection()</code> also renders the entire form output inline.  For legibility purposes I'd like to at least have line breaks where appropriate when viewing the source (I'd wish for proper indentation, too, but that seems like a tall order since even IDE's get it wrong much of the time)</p>

<p>So, is there a built-in option for either of these concerns that I'm missing or, alternatively, a way to define a factory or helper? If I'd need to write a helper, I'd want it to apply to all modules.</p>

Currently I'm creating a sheet of graph paper with the canvas object in HTML5.  I'm able to create the canvas as well as fill in the selected areas with a color by finding the x/y position.  Unfortunately I'm having some troubles using the jQuery mousemove method to display a pop-up of the information selected for the square.  <br><br></p>

    context = canvas.getContext('2d');

    context.lineWidth=0.5;
    context.strokeStyle='#999999';

<a href=""http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/PLUG/LDAP+Plugin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/PLUG/LDAP+Plugin</a></p>

<p>Now, I can't see any reason why it shouldn't work with MIT kerberos5 GSSAPI. After all this are all standard protocols.</p>

<p>So, I decided to try to use MIT kerberos instead of apache-ds</p>

<p>This is my configuration :</p>

<pre><code>  sonar.security.realm:LDAP
    sonar.authenticator.createUsers=true
    ldap.authentication:GSSAPI
    #ldap.preauthentication=true
    ldap.url=ldap://ldap:389
    ldap.bindDn=uid=sclaus,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
    ldap.bindPassword:password 
    ldap.user.baseDn:cn=sonar-users,ou=Groups,dc=mycompany,dc=com
    ldap.user.request:(&amp;(objectClass=posixGroup)(memberUid={uid}))
    ldap.group.baseDn:cn=sonar-administrators,ou=Groups,dc=mycompany,dc=com
    ldap.group.request:(&amp;(objectClass=posixGroup)(memberUid={uid}))
</code></pre>

<p>First question :
If I leave bind dn empty will get error complaining about when you use SASL you should define bind DN </p>

<p>I thought when you use GSSAPI, you can/should use kerberos ticket ? then why dose it matter to define bind DN ?</p>

<p>the actual error is :
ERROR o.s.s.p.Platform  Unable to open LDAP connection
org.sonar.api.utils.SonarException: Unable to open LDAP connection</p>

<p>Caused by: org.ietf.jgss.GSSException: No valid credentials provided (Mechanism level: Failed to find any Kerberos tgt)</p>

<p>I already have initiate kerberos ticket on the system :</p>

<pre><code>-sh-4.1$ ldapwhoami  -Y GSSAPI -h ldap
SASL/GSSAPI authentication started
SASL username: sclaus@mycompany
SASL SSF: 56
SASL data security layer installed.
dn:uid=sclaus,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea what do I do wrong ?</p>

<p>As we can see here, if i build a table representing a weekly schedule off these values, the mac will start at 6am on the sunday contained in the current week.
But the pc will start at 6am on the sunday contained in the next week.</p>

<p>Which means any appointments i create are out of sync on the pc (different days to whats expected)
note: the pc has been tested with both jdk1.6 and jdk1.7</p>

<p>I have this issue where I have a Unix timestamp (in seconds) that needs to display as a readable date in the UI, but be saved to the server in it's original format. Previously I was using the jQuery UI datepicker, and made a custom directive with $formatters and $parsers that would take care of the transformations. Worked great. </p>

<p>Then I decided to ditch the jQuery to lighten the payload of the app, and so have switched to using ngQuickDate ( <a href=""https://github.com/adamalbrecht/ngQuickDate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/adamalbrecht/ngQuickDate</a> ) which is great actually.</p>

<p>BUT it has it's own pipeline of $formatters and $parsers, and relies on a js Date object residing in the model. :p</p>

<p>I've been banging my head on this all day trying to figure out if my directive could play nice with this other one. It stands to reason that I should be able to put my directive there and have my parsing and formatting functions inject into the pipeline and work as expected, except that the date picker directive directly references $modelValue in several places and so actually bypasses the pipeline as far as I can tell. </p>

<p>Is there a way to make reference the value as transformed by my formatter, rather than the direct modelValue? I tried viewValue but that didn't work. :p</p>

<p>I don't really understand how the formatters and parsers get invoked I guess. That's my main question. </p>

    #    annotate(Max('date_from'))
    #session_qs = qs.order_by('get_first_session__date_from')

    return session_qs

<p>and inside models.py</p>

<pre><code>class Sessions(models.Model):

<p>Here's the issue:</p>

<p>Say I set the Secure Canvas URL of my app to <a href=""https://themediadudes.com/httpstest/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://themediadudes.com/httpstest/</a></p>

<p>That page contains only a link to Google:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""http://www.google.com""&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I view the app on Facebook and click the link, nothing happens. An error appears in the console:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[blocked] The page at <a href=""https://apps.facebook.com/myappname/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apps.facebook.com/myappname/</a> ran insecure
  content from <a href=""http://www.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that having insecure scripts/stylesheets etc. on an https page isn't allowed, but a simple link to a different website shouldn't be blocked right?. I assume Facebook is running some scripts which do something with the page before sending the user there? Which causes the error.</p>

<p>If I set the target of the link to _top or _blank it works.</p>

<p>Ideally I want to be able to use a javascript window.location to send the user to this insecure URL, or header('Location: blah'); in PHP. But neither of those work either. And it looks like this is a bigger problem than that if even a simple link to an insecure URL doesn't work.</p>

<p>I thought it may be caused by whatever makes the 'fluid' canvas width and canvas height settings work. But I tried setting both width and height to fixed and the problem still happens.</p>

<p>Does anybody have a solution or workaround, or can anybody at least shed some more light on this?
Thanks</p>

<pre><code> while(true)
 { 
   myStopWatch.Start();
   DoMyJob();
   myStopWatch.Stop();
   FPS = 1000/myStopWatch.Elapsed.ToMillionSeconds();
   myStopWatch.Reset();
 }
</code></pre>

<p>which works pretty good, I got the FPS around 100(+/-2). But sometimes I just want to focus on a certain part of the <em>DoMyJob()</em> performance and add some feedbacks, so I split the <em>DoMyJob()</em> to <em>DoMyJob1()</em> and add <em>DoMyJobs2()</em>. the first part is mainly calculation stuff, second part is to visualize the calculation on the Form and update some indicators.</p>

<p>So the code becomes:</p>

<pre><code> while(true)
 { 
   myStopWatch.Start();
   DoMyJob_1();
   myStopWatch.Stop();
   FPS = 1000/myStopWatch.Elapsed.ToMillionSeconds();
   myStopWatch.Reset();
   DoMyJob_2();
 }
</code></pre>

<p>I did not expect anything would mess up the FPS since <em>DoMyJob1</em> is almost the same as the original <em>DoMyJob</em>. But oops..it messed up. the FPS becomes frenzy, bouncing between 40 and up to 600 in a somehow random manner. I wiped out the <em>DoMyJob2()</em> and FPS went back to steady 100.</p>

<p>As I examined deep into the FPS sequence, I found out the FPSs are not random at all - they had like 4 or 5 different ranges, in my code, 30-50, 100-120, 300-360, 560-600, etc. Not a single number falls into the gaps. Then I tried the code in another laptop and the issue still exists, but just with different ranges. I know StopWatch uses Win32API. Is it because it's buggy and I run the code on the 64bit system??</p>

<p>BTW: what the best way to measure FPS on .NET Windows Form App? (like if FPS=100 or more)</p>

<p>According to me, my options are summarized as below</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Leave server-side pushes and stick with periodic Ajax requests + PHP.</p></li>
<li><p>Stick with Node.js and leave PHP and do all FB programming in javascript (if that is even possible, which I think it is).</p></li>
<li><p>use server side pushes in Apache (which I heard is not a good way to go).</p></li>
<li><p>Go with a technology like Java with some comet support and FB API's. (I don't know Pyhton).</p></li>
<li><p>HTML5 has introduced server side updates as well ,maybe it can help. (haven't given it much thought though)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Which is the best way to go? I have good experience with Java, PHP, and javascript.</p>

<p>Let me explain a bit. I have table <strong>users</strong> and I added a tsvector column to it called tsv.</p>

<pre><code>      Column       |            Type             |                     Modifiers

 username          | character varying(255)      | not null
 tsv               | tsvector                    |
</code></pre>

<p>Now every user has many <strong>articles</strong>.</p>

<p>What I want now is to store the articles title as tsvector in the tsv column. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE users SET tsv = to_tsvector(
  SELECT string_agg(title) 
  FROM users INNER JOIN books 
  ON user.id = articles.user_id 
  GROUP BY user.id
)
</code></pre>

<p>So obviously the query would not work even without trying to make a tsvector out of a SELECT. It has basically 2 ""problems""</p>

The problem was that I had it installed already, but didn't know, and tried to install from source. This created two versions and the gem didn't know which to use. I fixed it by going to the downloaded source and running</p>

<pre><code>sudo make uninstall
</code></pre>

<p>Then I ran gem install rmagick again and it worked!</p>

<p>[ORIGINAL PROBLEM]</p>

<p>I'm trying to install the rmagick gem like in <a href=""http://railscasts.com/episodes/253-carrierwave-file-uploads"">this railscast</a>. Here's a snippet of what I put in my gemfile:</p>

<pre><code> gem 'rmagick'
 gem 'carrierwave'
</code></pre>

<p>And when I run bundle install I get the following output:</p>

"32429543","1","32430300","","2015-09-07 00:11:09","","0","36","<p>I created a C++ function that is a part of a bigger project. This function is called a lot. In order to enhance the performance we decided to split that function into 4 parts, each two running in parallel. The complete program takes one input, and one input only, then it does a simulation, it passes a variable of length 2000 to the function in question. </p>

<p>This function operates on the variable (20,096 max operations,150,000 additions, and no multiplications).  Those operations are done by func1 and func2 in parallel, twice (so every time each function does quarter of those opperations). both functions share the same input in memory (<code>double Signal</code> of size 700 (read only), <code>double A, B, C, H</code>, (all of size (double) 5600, write and read) ) and output (<code>double L</code> of size 700).</p>

<p>No mutexes are necessary because func1 works on one half of A,B,C,H (read and write), and writes into its half in L, while func2 does the same in its half. However, there are instances where both functions, or threads, are reading Signal at the same time. On the second call, the threads almost do the same operations. </p>

<p>The problem is that the Threaded program runs a bit slower than the serial program. When I time each func alone they run 1/4th of the total function time of the original function time, which makes sense as func1 is called twice, and func2 is called twice as well. I use clock_t clock() for timing (This measures wall clock in windows, not as specified in the standard). but that was coherent with other timing tools like windows QueryPerformanceCounter. </p>

<p>I timed everything, and tried everything I saw. I used the optimizing optoins -O3 O2 Ofast. I created a separate memory for each thread (even for the read only arrays, then copied results). </p>

<p>I have two theories in mind
1- overhead of pthreads is taking as much time as the functions are taking
2- main() is sleeping while waiting for pthread_join. </p>

<p>I am more convinced with theory 2 because they only place time is lost is the somewhere in the pthread_join. </p>

<p>I wrote this sample code to simulate the problem.  please note that the loop positions are essential in the algorithm I am implementing, so moving operations to use less loops will not work.</p>

<p>Note that if you increment the size of data (j&lt;10000 and j&lt;5000) and decrease the count range correspondingly, the performance of the threaded program begins to perform better. </p>

<p>This runs in 1.3 seconds.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int i,m,j,k;

    clock_t time_time;
    time_time=clock();

    for (int count =0 ; count&lt;50000;++count){
        for (j=0;j&lt;10000;j++){
            m=j;
            k=j+1;
            i=m*j;

    }

<p>The only thing I can think of is to loop through all the Measure Groups within the Cube and check if it contains a reference to the Dimension in question:</p>

<pre><code>Dim dimID As String = ""SOME_DIM_ID""
Dim relatedMeasureGroups As New List(Of Amo.MeasureGroup)
For Each mg As Amo.MeasureGroup In _cube.MeasureGroups
    If mg.Dimensions.Contains(dimID) Then
        relatedMeasureGroups.Add(mg)
        Continue For
    End If
Next
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but is obviously very slow and inefficient. Is there a more direct way that I am just not seeing?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: I should say, I need to do this because I am trying to find all potential <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms345139%28v=sql.90%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">many-to-many Measure Groups for a Dimension</a>. As you can tell, the way I'm doing it is a bit manual (find Measure Groups related to the initial Dimension, find all Dimensions related to them, and yet again find all Measure Groups related to <em>those</em>), so if there is a more direct way to solve that problem, it could bypass my need to solve the original problem.</p>

<p>The query runs fine from the java code but does not return any results.

<ol>
<li>for login</li>
<li>some other useful info for the user.</li>

<p>Now I know that splitview controller should always be the root view controller. So what i do is create three objects in my appDelegate class. 
A , B, and split view controller C.</p>

<p>the order of navigation is A-->B-->C;</p>

<p>so in the app delegate this is what i do.. </p>

<pre><code>self.loginViewController=[[LoginViewController alloc] init];
self.window.rootViewController = self.loginViewController;
</code></pre>

<p>and then once the login button is pressed this is what I do from the loginView controller.. </p>

<pre><code>TSAppDelegate *appDelegate=(TSAppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
                appDelegate.meetingsViewController=[[MeetingsViewController alloc] init];
                [UIView
                 transitionWithView:appDelegate.window 
                 duration:0.8

                     [UIView setAnimationsEnabled:NO];
                     appDelegate.window.rootViewController=appDelegate.meetingsViewController;

                 completion:nil];

<p>this here presents the second view...
and similarly I show the split view controller if some action is performed on the second view controller...</p>

<p>So my question is if it is the correct way to do it... ? (This works fine by the way and also its an enterprise application)</p>

<p>P.S. I also tried making the split view controller as the rootviewcontroller and adding the other view controllers views as its subview but that doesn't work properly.</p>

<p><strong>NETWORK COMMUNICATION:</strong> Coming from a <a href=""https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonet"" rel=""nofollow"">Kryonet</a> background (<a href=""http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=19645"" rel=""nofollow"">and since Kryonet is incompatible with GWT</a>), I have landed on <a href=""https://github.com/rzschech/gwt-comet/tree/master/src/net/zschech/gwt/websockets/client"" rel=""nofollow"">gwt-web-sockets-1.0.0</a> (a Java GWT wrapper for JavaScript WebSockets) for network communication (which is perfect for me since I'm really only comfortable in Java).</p>

<p>With use of the gwt-web-sockets-1.0.0 library I can effectively communicate from client -> server using the follwing native call:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/dsDzX.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong>  I am skeptical of the scalability of the above send() method. Kryonet serializes classes and supports sending respective serialized instances (ex: sending a <em>Player</em> instance). With the above implementation, all I'm really given to work with is sending data as type <strong>String</strong>. I have found another JS wrapper implementation by <a href=""https://github.com/sksamuel/gwt-websockets"" rel=""nofollow"">sksamuel</a> in which he implements practically the same thing as gwt-web-sockets-1.0.0 except he takes it one step further and adds <a href=""https://github.com/sksamuel/gwt-websockets#binary-support"" rel=""nofollow"">binary support</a>. </p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ideally, I'd like to be able to implement something similar to Kryonet - serializing and sending objects natively through Java (GWT-compatible). If that isn't possible, I'm guessing the next best solution would be to add another layer above the described <code>send(String data)</code> and/or <code>send(byte[] data)</code> methods for network communication. Perhaps something like <code>send(Serializer.convert(data))</code> -- where data is my <em>Player</em> object that is converted into either String or byte[] which is the expected argument of the native send() method) that is compatible with GWT.</p>

<p>As always, thanks for any help you can provide.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>Is this the correct way to insert a row to a table and it's relationship? Is there a better way?</p>

<p>And my 2nd question...this line:</p>

<pre><code>User::find($user-&gt;id)-&gt;qualifications()-&gt;save($qualification);
</code></pre>

<p>This may be a bit crazy but I just would like this explaining to me, the $user->id gets the id of the previously inserted row, if two people were to insert at the same time, how would I be sure that it would get the correct id? As in, user A saves, then user B saves, then the first User::find bit runs for user A but this would find user B's id. Is this where the transaction comes in?</p>

<p>I like using memcached for caching because least recently used keys automatically get pushed out of the cache and I don't need the cache data to persist. Redis is mostly new to me, but I understand that it's persistent by default and that keys do not expire out of the cache automatically.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just wanted to be more clear with my question. I know it's feasible to use only Redis instead of both. I guess I just want to know if there are any specific disadvantages in doing so?

If I have a project which includes two classes, a base class <strong>Soup</strong> and a derived class <strong>TomatoSoup</strong> which I compile as a static library (.lib), I get unresolved tokens on the virtual methods in <strong>Soup</strong>.

<p>This issue is driving me crazy and I hope to prevent it from driving other developers nuts in the future.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This worked with Greg Hewgill's argument-name commenting method when the TomatoSoup::heat was implemented in the header file, but the error came back when I moved the implementation to TomatoSoup.cpp. I've modified the question to reflect that.</p>

<p>The company where I work gave me this data to work with. In short, it's TSCS data with the firm as the cross-sectional unit with time units as fiscal years. Each firm has various accounts. I'm interested in creating a total of money spent on each account for a given firm.</p>

<p>I can provide a simple illustration of the data below. Let <code>firm</code> be the cross-sectional unit of interest. Each <code>firm</code> has various accounts on which the company spends money. Some accounts are common to all firms, others are unique. Not every <code>firm</code> had money spent on an account in a given year. In fact, some were not eligible for accounts until later on in the data, and others drop out (as such, the panel data can be considered unbalanced). As such, the NAs in the data I was provided could be treated as 0s, though it's a little bit problematic. Some firms are eligible in a given year but don't receive money in an account. Other firms are ineligible because of drop-out or late entry.</p>

<p>The data look like this, and it was given to me in wide format. It's a simplified version for illustration. In this illustration, <code>firm=B</code> wasn't eligible for an account in FY1990 and <code>firm=C</code> drops out in FY1992.</p>

<pre><code>firm   account   FY1990 FY1991 FY1992

B     Account 3     NA    800     NA

<p>What I'd like to do (and was told to do) was amend this data so that it looks like this:</p>

D      TOTAL      2600   3840   4500
</code></pre>

<p>I could just as easily do this in Excel or some other spreadsheet program, but that would be tedious and it invites more human error than if I were to use R to program this. I'm not against creating a new data frame with the totals rather than trying to add a row underneath all the accounts for a given firm. It might be easier to just put a 0 for the total for a given firm ineligible for an account in a given fiscal year. I can always recode some zeroes as NAs next and automate that process as well.</p>

<p>My assumption is this would require a loop, but I'm a novice in R programming. Any input would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Reproducible code for this illustration is below.</p>

Since the constructor for <code>ARRAY</code> columns allows you to specify if you want the values as tuples, I ended up just reflecting the table out of the database, looking for <code>ARRAY</code> columns, replacing them with an <code>ARRAY</code> column that has the appropriate keyword argument and then using that to construct expressions. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>from sqlalchemy import Table, Column, String, MetaData, select

def swapArrayColumns(table):
    new_cols = []
    for col in table.columns:
        if isinstance(col.type, ARRAY):
            new_cols.append(Column(col.name, ARRAY(String, as_tuple=True)))
        else:
        new_cols.append(Column(col.name, col.type))
    return new_cols

engine = create_engine('postgresql://localhost:5432/dbname')    
meta = MetaData()
table = Table('table_name', meta, autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)
new_cols = swapArrayColumns(table)

# delete old meta since we are re-mapping table
del meta
meta = MetaData()
new_table = Table('table_name', meta, *new_cols)

# Now I can use the new table object to generate expressions
sel = select([new_table]).where(new_table.c.foo == 'bar')
rows = list(engine.execute(sel))
</code></pre>

<p>Since this gets used quite a lot, I'm wondering if there's a more elegant way of accomplishing this same thing perhaps by creating a custom sqlalchemy dialect that just does this for me. All I really want is my <code>ARRAY</code> columns to come back as python <code>tuple</code>s by default.</p>

<p>When the metro app is started it creates a sequence to do the tile updates. This works perfectly.</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>

<p>When I restart my computer the metro tile stops working. Instead it goes back to the default metro tile (app name bottom left image middle). </p>

<p>I can get it to work again by simply starting and stopping the metro app. But I do not wish to do this.</p>

<p>I implement a class that implements IBackgroundTask and implements the run method.</p>

<pre><code>public void Run(IBackgroundTaskInstance taskInstance){
    BackgroundTaskDeferral deferral = taskInstance.GetDeferral();
    TileScheduler.CreateSchedule();

<p>In the metro app package manifest added declaration ""Background Task"" and under entry point pointed to this class. I also register timer and system event. </p>

<p>This class code basically calls the same code path the main app does when setting the tile sequence for the first time except that it is wrapped with a deferral.</p>

<p><strong>The Question</strong>
Is this the right path (as it doesn't seem to be working so I guess my implementation is wrong)? or is there a better way to do this? </p>

After that, both client and server will still keep the underlying TCP connection open when they are done with the first request/response, and then use the same connection in the following requests/responses.  </p>

<p>What I'm not clear about is the programming model. Consider the following client code in go:  </p>

<pre><code>resp, _ := client.Get(""http://www.stackoverflow.com"")
// do some other things
resp, _ = client.Get(""http://www.stackoverflow.com/questions"")
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I know, <code>keep-alive</code> is the default strategy in HTTP/1.1.  </p>

<p><strong>Q1: Do these two requests use the same TCP connection?</strong></p>

<p>On the server side:</p>

<p>When one request comes, the Go HTTP framework dispatches it to a handler, then due to keep-alive, the framework should prepare for the next request on the same TCP connection. However I don't see any block-mode read code in a handler. So,</p>

<p><strong>Q2: Does the Go HTTP framework use some kind of non-block mode to deal with keep-alive?</strong></p>

<p>I mean, a handler will not block for reading, but just return when done with a request, then the framework will poll each non-block TCP connection, if one of them has data arrive, it dispatches it to an associated handler, and so on. Only when the request has a header of <code>Connection:Close</code>, the framework will close the TCP connection when the handler returns.</p>

<p>For which I get the print out </p>

<pre><code>300 300 
image written out false 
</code></pre>

<p>The dimension (300x300) is as expected. However, though the call to 
ImageIO.write didn't throw an Exception, it returned false which, 
according to the JDK Documentation, means that ""no appropriate writer 
(was) found"". True enough, I could not find gabored.jpg anywhere.</p>

<p>Is there anything wrong with my code? I'd be glad for any suggestions. 
Thanks!</p>

<p>To elaborate: I have a cron job on my server running a bash script as root that checks a file containing a list of domain names that I want to be created. If the file contains a domain name, it automatically creates a new virtual host for this domain, edits my hosts file, and restarts the server. This all works perfectly, however what I would like for the script to do, is that it activates the domain that it automatically creates before it restarts the server. I tried doing this using apache 2's <code>a2ensite</code> command, however the script returns an error saying the command is not found.</p>

<p>My dream query would find the first non-null value in each of the data columns, sorted on the <code>sortCol</code>.</p>

<p>For example, when selecting the magical aggregate of the first three columns, sorted by the <code>sortCol</code> descending.</p>

<pre><code>col1     col2     col3
========================
5        7         0

<p>My @ControllerAdvice extends Spring's ResponseEntityExceptionHandler and implements no interfaces.</p>

<p>The @ControllerAdvice gets called correctly, but the @Autowired dependency is never injected.  There are no startup injection errors, the dependency is simply null.</p>

<p>I guess it has to do with how Spring proxies the @ControllerAdvice with cglib so that the @Autowired annotation gets lost.</p>

<p>I tested by implementing an interface, so that Spring could create a JDK proxy but it didn't work either. Actually with an interface, it didn't even gets called at all... even if I also annotate the interface with @ControllerAdvice.</p>

<p>Is there a way to specify that Spring should use JDK proxies for that particular case?</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm using Spring 3.2.4.RELEASE, by the way.</p>

<p>Sample class:</p>

<pre><code>@ControllerAdvice
public class RestExceptionHandler extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {

    @Autowired(required = true)
    public AuditService auditService;

    @ExceptionHandler(value = { RuntimeException.class })
    public final ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt; handleRuntimeException(Exception ex, WebRequest request) {
        // auditService is null here!

<p>Before my most recent update, I would set up my manager and database and then call <code>initializeQuery</code> the following would have pulled all the docs from the db with their data intact where I could see the documentID and data in each doc (double checking the database I see all the docs are still there and they all have the key <code>type</code> set with a string): (Code posted in Objective C, though seeing similar results with Swift/Android)</p>

<pre><code> - (void) initializeQuery {
     CBLQuery* query = [_database createAllDocumentsQuery];
     liveQuery = query.asLiveQuery;
     [liveQuery addObserver: self forKeyPath: @""rows"" options: 0 context: NULL];
     [liveQuery start];
 }

 - (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context{
     if (object == liveQuery) {

         CBLQueryEnumerator *result = liveQuery.rows;

         NSLog(@""No. 1 - number of rows is %lu"", (unsigned long)result.count);

         for (CBLQueryRow *row in result) {
              NSLog(@""No. 2 - what is each row's doc ID: %@"", row.documentID);
              NSLog(@""No. 3 - what is each row's document %@"", row.document);
         }
     }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Now (since updating to the newest Couchbase Lite) I still get the correct number of rows (on NSLog No. 1), and get all the right docIds (on NSLog No. 2) but each row's document is now <code>(null)</code> (on NSLog No. 3) and all keys/values do not exist. Can anyone explain to me if I need to change something to get my data to remain intact all the way to the end. If so a poor Idaho programmer will owe you a life debt!

<p>What I a trying to do is load the Node object with all the child objects all at once. No Lazy load. The reason is I have thousands of Node objects in the database and I have to send them over the wire using WCF Service.I ran into the classes SQL N+ 1 problem. I am using Fluent Nhibernate with Automapping and NHibernate Profiler suggested me to use <strong>FetchMode.Eager</strong> to load the whole objects at once. I am using the following qyuery</p>

<pre><code>     Session.CreateCriteria(typeof (Node))
            .SetFetchMode( ""Etype"", FetchMode.Join )
            .SetFetchMode( ""Etype.Properties"", FetchMode.Join )
            .SetFetchMode( ""Etype.Properties.ListValues"", FetchMode.Join )
</code></pre>

<p>OR using NHibernate LINQ</p>

<pre><code>        Session.Linq&lt;NodeType&gt;()
         .Expand( ""Etype"")
         .Expand( ""Etype.Properties"" )
         .Expand( ""Etype.Properties.ListValues"" )
</code></pre>

<p>When I run any of the above query, they both generate one same single query with all the left outer joins, which is what I need. However, for some reason the return IList from the query is not being loaded property into the objects. Infact the returned Nodes count is equal to the number of rows of the query, so the Nodes objects are repeated.Moreover, the properties within each Node are repeated, and so do the Listvalues.</p>

<p>So I would like to know how to modify the above query to return all unique Nodes with the properties and list values within them.</p>

<p>In the second form I have two buttons stop, and start clicking on which I should be able to stop and start the mainwindow(All the child threads).</p>

<p>For this I am declaring 
public static ManualResetEvent mre = new ManualResetEvent(false);</p>

<p>in program.cs where two UI threads are started
and trying to invoke it from the second form on start and stop </p>

<p>Is there anyway to tweak MyBatis (3.0.4) so that when it's running through the nested result maps and creating objects based on the results, it doesn't create ""duplicate"" objects and instead references the object that has already been created?  To clarify, let's say I've got an object that consists of the following (simplified) info:</p>

<pre><code>Public class PrimaryObject {
    Private Contact role1;
    Private Contact role2;
    Private List&lt;OtherObject&gt; otherObjects;
}  

Public class OtherObject {
    Private String otherProperty;
    Private Contact otherRole;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the result maps/SQL (assume type aliases):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;mapper namespace=""PrimaryObject""&gt;
    &lt;resultMap id=""primaryObject"" type=""primaryObject""&gt;
        &lt;association property=""role1"" column=""ROLE_1_ID""
         select=""Contact.findContactByPK"" /&gt;
        &lt;association property=""role2"" column=""ROLE_2_ID""
         select=""Contact.findContactByPK"" /&gt;
        &lt;collection property=""otherObjects"" column=""PRIMARY_OBJECT_ID""
         javaType=""List"" ofType=""OtherObject""
         select=""OtherObject.findOtherObjectsByPrimaryObjectPK"" /&gt;
    &lt;/resultMap&gt;
    &lt;select id=""selectPrimaryObjectByPK"" parameterType=""...""
     resultMap=""primaryObject""&gt;
        SELECT * FROM PRIMARY_OBJECT_TABLE
        WHERE PRIMARY_OBJECT_ID = #{value}
    &lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;mapper namespace=""OtherObject""&gt;
    &lt;resultMap id=""otherObject"" type=""otherObject""&gt;
        &lt;result property=""otherProperty"" column=""OTHER_PROPERTY"" /&gt;
        &lt;association property=""otherRole"" column=""OTHER_ROLE_ID""
         select=""Contact.findContactByPK"" /&gt;
    &lt;/resultMap&gt;
    &lt;select id=""findOtherObjectsByPrimaryObjectPK"" parameterType=""...""
     resultMap=""otherObject""&gt;
        SELECT OTHER_OBJECT.OTHER_PROPERTY, OTHER_OBJECT.OTHER_ROLE_ID
        FROM OTHER_OBJECT JOIN PRIMARY_OBJECT
            ON PRIMARY_OBJECT.PRIMARY_OBJECT_ID = OTHER_OBJECT.PRIMARY_OBJECT_ID
    &lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;mapper namespace=""Contact""&gt;
    &lt;resultMap id=""contact"" type=""Contact""&gt;
        &lt;result property...
        ...
    &lt;/resultMap&gt;
    &lt;select id=""findContactByPK"" parameterType=""..."" resultMap=""contact""&gt;
        SELECT * FROM CONTACT...
    &lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's say a contact is acting as both <code>role1</code> and <code>role2</code> on <code>primaryObject</code>.  From what I've seen, MyBatis creates the contact object referenced in <code>role1</code>, and when it hits <code>role2</code>, it simply references the object it created for <code>role1</code>.  That's great!</p>

<p>However, let's say that same contact is acting as the <code>otherRole</code> in <code>otherObject</code>.  MyBatis now creates an identical contact object, as opposed to just referencing the original <code>contact</code> created/referenced when making the <code>primaryObject</code>.  Is there any way I can prevent this from happening, and instead just store a reference in my <code>otherObject</code> that references that same <code>contact</code> that the two different fields in <code>primaryObject</code> are pointing to?  I've been looking at a <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/mybatis/wiki/ResultHandlerExample"" rel=""nofollow"">custom ResultHandler</a>, but the example's complexity coupled with my lack of experience is preventing me from understanding if it even addresses the problem I'm trying to solve in the first place.

</code></pre>

<p>After checking <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-developers/VcjXWBosQ88"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, I've modified my cancelLogcatToFile with the suggested solution, so my code is like this:</p>

<pre><code>private void exportLogcatToFile(String fileName) {
    String command = new StringBuffer(""logcat -f "").append(fileName)
        .append(""\n"").toString();
    try {
        logcatToFileProcess = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(""su"");
        final DataOutputStream os = new DataOutputStream(
                logcatToFileProcess.getOutputStream());
        os.writeBytes(command);

    } catch (IOException e) {
        Log.e(TAG, Log.getStackTraceString(e));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And to kill the process:</p>

<pre><code>private void cancelLogcatToFile() {
    if (logcatToFileProcess != null) {
        // logcatToFileProcess.destroy();
        destroyProcess(logcatToFileProcess);
        logcatToFileProcess = null;
        }
    }

private static void destroyProcess(Process process) {
    try {
        if (process != null) {
        // use exitValue() to determine if process is still running.
        process.exitValue();
        }
    } catch (IllegalThreadStateException e) {
        // process is still running, kill it.
        process.destroy();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> This code is going to be executed in a rooted device, so <code>su</code> will not be a problem.</p>

<p>Also, I know I could do something like <code>killall logcat</code> but I want to keep another logcat processes alive</p>

I've got an <strong>ODROID-XU board (big.LITTLE 2 x Cortex-A15 + 2 x Cortex-A7)</strong> board and I'm trying to understand a bit more about the ARM architecture. In my ""experimenting"" code I've now arrived at the stage where I want to <strong>WAKE UP THE OTHER CORES FROM THEIR WFI (wait-for-interrupt) state.</strong></p>

<p>The missing information I'm still trying to find is:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> When getting the base address of the memory-mapped GIC I understand that I need to read CBAR; But no piece of documentation explains how the bits in CBAR (the 2 PERIPHBASE values) should be arranged to get to the final GIC base address</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> When sending an SGI through the GICD_SGIR register, what interrupt ID between 0 and 15 should I choose? Does it matter?</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> When sending an SGI through the GICD_SGIR register, how can I tell the other cores <strong>WHERE TO START EXECUTION FROM</strong>?</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> How does the fact that <strong>my code is loaded by the U-BOOT bootloader</strong> affect this context?</p>

<p>The <strong>Cortex-A Series Programmer's Guide v3.0</strong> (found here: <a href=""http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.den0013c/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a>) states the following in <strong>section 22.5.2</strong> (SMP boot in Linux, page <strong>271</strong>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>While the primary core is booting, the secondary cores will be held in a standby state, using the 
  WFI instruction. It (the primary core) will provide a startup address to the secondary cores and wake them using an 
  Inter-Processor Interrupt(IPI), meaning an SGI signalled through the GIC</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does Linux do that? The documentation-<strong>S</strong> don't give any other details regarding ""<strong>It will provide a startup address to the secondary cores</strong>"".</p>

<p>My frustration is growing and I'd be very grateful for answers.
Thank you very much in advance!</p>

<p><strong>EXTRA DETAILS</strong></p>

<p>Documentation I use:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ARMv7-A&amp;R Architecture Reference Manual</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cortex-A15 TRM (Technical Reference Manual)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cortex-A15 MPCore TRM</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cortex-A Series Programmer's Guide v3.0</strong></li>
<li><strong>GICv2 Architecture Specification</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>What I've done by now:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>UBOOT loads me at 0x40008000; I've set-up Translation Tables (TTBs), written TTBR0 and TTBCR accordingly and mapped 0x40008000 to 0x8000_0000 (2GB), so I also enabled the MMU</strong></li>
<li><strong>Set-up exception handlers of my own</strong></li>
<li><strong>I've got Printf functionality over the serial (UART2 on ODROID-XU)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>All the above seems to work properly.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do now:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Get the GIC base address => at the moment I read CBAR and I simply AND (&amp;) its value with 0xFFFF8000 and use this as the GIC base address, although I'm almost sure this ain't right</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enable the GIC distributor (at offset 0x1000 from GIC base address?), by writting GICD_CTLR with the value 0x1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Construct an SGI with the following params: Group = 0, ID = 0, TargetListFilter = ""All CPUs Except Me"" and send it (write it) through the GICD_SGIR GIC register</strong></li>
<li>Since I haven't passed any execution start address for the other cores, nothing happens after all this</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>....UPDATE....</strong></p>

<p>I've started looking at the Linux kernel and QEMU source codes in search for an answer. Here's what I found out (please correct me if I'm wrong):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>When powering up the board ALL THE CORES start executing from the reset vector</strong></li>
<li><strong>A <em>software (firmware)</em> component executes WFI on the secondary cores and some other code that will act as a protocol between these secondary cores and the primary core, when the latter wants to wake them up again</strong></li>
<li><strong>For example, the protocol used on the <em>EnergyCore ECX-1000 (Highbank)</em> board is as follows:</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><code>**(1)** the secondary cores enter WFI and when</code></p>

<p><code>**(2)** the primary core sends an SGI to wake them up</code></p>

<p><code>**(3)** they check if the value at address (0x40 + 0x10 * coreid) is non-null;</code></p>

<p><code>**(4)** if it is non-null, they use it as an address to jump to (execute a BX)</code></p>

<p><code>**(5)** otherwise, they re-enter standby state, by re-executing WFI</code></p>

<p><code>**(6)** So, if I had an EnergyCore ECX-1000 board, I should write (0x40 + 0x10 * coreid) with the address I want each of the cores to jump to and send an SGI</code></p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1. What is the software component that does this? Is it the BL1 binary I've written on the SD Card, or is it U-BOOT?</strong></li>
<li><strong>2. From what I understand, this software protocol differs from board to board. Is it so, or does it only depend on the underlying processor?</strong></li>
<li><strong>3. Where can I find information about this protocol for a pick-one ARM board? - can I find it on the official ARM website or on the board webpage?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Last year, we were building for .NET 1.1, and ran into a tricky issue where</p>

<ul>
<li>our code ran on .NET 2.0</li>
<li>a customer upgraded with some software that somehow set 1.1 as default</li>
<li>our code ran on .NET 1.1 and was unable to deserialize its stored state</li>

<p>This particular issue was ""resolved"" by barring that particular software upgrade, and shouldn't be a problem now that we're targeting the .NET 2.0 framework (so we can't possibly run on 1.1).</p>

<p>What is the chance that this serialization could again change incompatibly between, 2.0 and newer frameworks?  If we use <code>&lt;supportedVersion&gt;</code> to fix our code to 2.0.50727, what are the chances of changes between 2.0.50727.1434 and 2.0.50727.nnnn (some future release)?  The data structures being serialized are arrays, maps, strings, et cetera from the standard class libraries.</p>

<p>Additionally, is it guaranteed that a 2.0.50727 framework will be always installed even after further .NET upgrades?  Pointers to Microsoft documentation welcome.</p>

<p><strong>What I'm trying to achieve:</strong></p>

<p>I'm having some trouble with jQueryUI's .selectable, I have created a Selectable with four different tabs, each tab displays different content added to it (a class for image, an append for a button and an append for paragraph text). </p>

<p>Here is a visual look at what I'm trying to achieve:

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>My Problem</strong></p>

<p>Currently, when clicking on one tab it will correctly display the contents of that tab, however as soon as you click to a different/same tab again it will:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add the contents overlapping the previous tab</p>

<ol>
<li>Button is added on every new click of same or other tab</li>
<li>New image class is added and pushed below the previous tab</li>
<li>Paragraph text overlaps</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>What I need</strong></p>

<p>I need a way so that on <strong>every</strong> tab click (same or other tab) it will clear all previous contents of the last tab (any buttons/paragraphs/image classes).</p>

<p>Also, one other problem with the jQueryUI .selectable() is that it allows selecting multiple tabs at once, if you drag your cursor over the tabs in my JSFiddle you'll see what I mean, I only want it to be able to select one at max.</p>

If the added graph is the first graph in the whole chart I want it to be red. If the new graph is not the first one I want it to be colored blue. Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>Public Shared Sub graphHinzufügen(pfad As String)

        Hauptseite.ChartWiderstand.Series.Add(System.IO.Path.GetFileName(pfad))
        With Hauptseite.ChartWiderstand.Series(System.IO.Path.GetFileName(pfad))
            .ChartType = DataVisualization.Charting.SeriesChartType.Spline
            For i = 0 To DateiWiderstand.wertepaarGeschwindigkeit.Count - 1
                .Points.AddXY(DateiWiderstand.wertepaarGeschwindigkeit.Item(i), DateiWiderstand.wertepaarWiderstand.Item(i))

                .Color = Color.Blue
            End If
        End With
    End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the <code>.Color = Color.Red</code> doesn't work like it should.
My tries of debugging:</p>

<ul>
<li>I made msgboxes in the if-cases just before the .Color-events. I let them give me the Series.Count. This worked. So I know that the if-cases are right and that the program goes in the first if-case when it is the first graph.</li>
<li>I use <code>.Color = Color.Red</code> in other event-handlers and the graph switches color just if I want. So this should be the right code to color a graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where is my mistake? If you need more code, just tell me which classes you want to so.
Thank you!</p>

<p>first i used the BarcodeWriter class in zxing.net to save it as a bitmap then I transformed it into a BitmapImage through this method :</p>

<pre><code>        private BitmapSource Bitmap2BitmapImage(Bitmap bitmap)
    {
        BitmapSource i = Imaging.CreateBitmapSourceFromHBitmap(

                       Int32Rect.Empty,
                       BitmapSizeOptions.FromEmptyOptions());
        return i;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I got it from a thread in here, then I added it to the flowdocument through InlineUIContainer .</p>

<p>This is the code :</p>

<pre><code> public void Print(string[] strArray)
    {
        System.Windows.Controls.Image barcodeimg = new System.Windows.Controls.Image();

        BarcodeWriter writer = new BarcodeWriter();

        writer.Options.PureBarcode = true;
        writer.Options.Width = 40;
        writer.Options.Height = 6;
        MessageBox.Show(strArray[1].ToString());
        string BID = strArray[1];
        Bitmap mmm = writer.Write(BID.ToString());


        FlowDocument flowDoc = new FlowDocument();
        Section sec = new Section();

        flowDoc.ColumnWidth = 2000;
        int x = Properties.Settings.Default.X;
        int y = Properties.Settings.Default.Y;
        int fontSize = Properties.Settings.Default.fontSize;

        sec.Padding = sec.Margin = new Thickness(x,y,0,0);
        sec.TextAlignment = TextAlignment.Center;
        sec.FontSize = fontSize ;

        double lineH = Properties.Settings.Default.LineHighet;

        barcodeimg.Source = Bitmap2BitmapImage(mmm);
        InlineUIContainer container = new InlineUIContainer(barcodeimg);
        container.FontStretch = FontStretches.ExtraCondensed;
        Paragraph paragraph = new Paragraph(container);
        sec.Blocks.Add(paragraph);
        flowDoc.Blocks.Add(sec);

        dialog.PrintDocument(idpSource.DocumentPaginator,""job1"");
    }

<p>The problem is the printed barcode width won't change, it changes a little bit when i change numbers but not even close to what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>Here is different tries of different sizes, you can see the height changes but the width is almost the same.</p>

<p>I use this to kick off the install:</p>

<pre><code>pip install -e git+https://bitbucket.org/myuser/project-one.git/master#egg=django_one 
</code></pre>

<p>which then attempts to download it's dependencies from setup.py that look like:</p>

<pre><code>install_requires = ['project-two',],
dependency_links = ['git+https://bitbucket.org/myuser/project-two.git/master#egg=project_two'],
</code></pre>

<p>This fails, the pip log looks like:</p>

<pre><code>Downloading/unpacking project-two (from project-one)

</code></pre>

<p>The curious thing about this setup is, if I take a clone of project-one and run </p>

<pre><code>python setup install
</code></pre>

<p>from there, project-two is fetched from bitbucket and installed into my virtualenv. My understanding was that pip was using setup tools under the hood, so my assumption was the success of that test validated my approach.</p>

<p>Any suggestions appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>FOLLOW UP:</strong></p>

<p>So the accepted answer is quite right - but my problem had the additional complexity of being a private repo (https + http auth-basic). Using the syntax</p>

<pre><code>dependency_links=[""http://user:password@bitbucket.org/myuser/...""]
</code></pre>

<p>still caused a 401. Running up a shell and using <code>pip.download.py</code> to run <code>urlopen</code> demonstrates the underlying problem (ie pip needs additional setup in <code>urllib2</code> to get this working).</p>

<p>The problem is mentioned <a href=""https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/786"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> but I couldn't get that working.</p>

<p>I had thought that creating my own onClickListener() and passing in the data needed as a parameter when it is initialized would work. It appears there are no syntax errors with what I came up with but when a button is clicked at run time the app crashes.</p>

<p>Heres a simplified version of what I've got thus far.</p>

<pre><code>int counter = 1;
for( Program element :  someList)
    {
    //some other code for dynamically creating textviews to stick the buttons in

    //code which creates the buttons on the fly
    moreInfo = new Button(this);
    moreInfo.setText(""More Info"");  
    moreInfo.setOnClickListener(new DynamicOnClickListener(counter));
    counter++;

    }
</code></pre>

<p>The custom listener class</p>

<pre><code>import android.util.Log;
import android.view.View;
import android.view.View.OnClickListener;
import android.widget.Toast;

public class DynamicOnClickListener implements OnClickListener
{

    int counter;
    public DynamicOnClickListener(int acounter) {
         this.counter = acounter;
    }

    public void onClick(View v) {
        Log.v(""DynamicOnClickListener"",""1"");
        Toast.makeText(v.getContext(), counter, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }

 }
</code></pre>

<p>So in theory if this worked each button would return a different number, hope that makes sense.</p>

I have not developed this project, but I have developed a small framework, which I am supposed to test, integrated with it. Upon copying, building and installing the project, it compiled, and I was able to launch it. However, after trying to add my framework (parent pom + 3 modules), I may have changed some settings, and now I am having trouble building the project. I have spent a lot of time trying to break down the problem, but all I have been able to do, is produce different errors, that I understand even less of.</p>

<p>I can't seem to find out where I can tell maven where to look for the parent POM. I have tried both the pom.xml, and settings.xml, but I haven't found any good options. I have also tried to change less obvious parameters, like changing localRepository, or adding repositories, but they proved ineffective</p>

<p>Here is my error message, interlaced with my attempts to fix it:</p>

<pre><code>C:\development\my-main\customer-webpart&gt;mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

<p>This is my domain. this includes the master pom of this project, although it is still part of a bigger system, and not the root. I would like to build, install and run this project, to test my framework. My framework is added as a dependency in the pom.xml.</p>

</ol>

<pre><code>java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out
 at java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)...
</code></pre>

<p>and I think the cause of this is mostly because the feed I am subscribed to gives information slower on certain times (as I normally get this error when the weekend comes, holidays or evenings). </p>

<p>I have been reading up on this <a href=""http://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.1.html#Heart-beating"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and I think this would help with my problem. However, I'm not so sure how to incorporate it with the current layout of my stomp client. Would I have to send a CONNECT header within Step 3?</p>

<p>I am currently using activemq to create my stomp client if that helps.</p>

<p>In the stomp <a href=""http://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.1.html#Heart-beating"" rel=""nofollow"">spec</a> we have: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regarding the heart-beats themselves, any new data received over the
  network connection is an indication that the remote end is alive. In a
  given direction, if heart-beats are expected every  milliseconds:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>the sender MUST send new data over the network connection at least    every  milliseconds </li>
  <li>if the sender has no real STOMP frame to send,    it MUST send a single newline byte (0x0A) </li>
  <li>if, inside a time window of    at least  milliseconds, the receiver did not receive any new data,    it CAN consider the
  connection as dead</li>
  <li>because of timing    inaccuracies, the receiver SHOULD be tolerant and take into account    an error margin</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Would that mean my client would need to send a newline bye every n seconds?</p>

<p>The following example is super contrived, but I think it gets the point across:</p>

<h2>main.cpp</h2>

<pre><code>#include ""data_pointer.h""

enum Type {
  kShort,
  kInt,
  kFloat,
  kDouble
};

DataPointer d() {
  Type t;
  // char * is returned, but is actually a pointer to some other type indicated by
  // the type parameter (void * would probably be the standard way of doing this)--
  // this is a straight C library
  char *value = getValueFromExternalSource(&amp;type);

  switch (type) {
  case kShort: return DataPointer&lt;short&gt;(reinterpret_cast&lt;short *&gt;(value));

  case kFloat: return DataPointer&lt;float&gt;(reinterpret_cast&lt;float *&gt;(value));
  case kDouble: return DataPointer&lt;double&gt;(reinterpret_cast&lt;double *&gt;(value));
  }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

<p>Compilation, though, gives me <code>'DataPointer' does not name a type</code>, at the declaration of <code>d()</code> which makes sense because it doesn't have a type associated with it.</p>

<p>I'm aware that the class is not actually extending the pdo object, i don't know why i called it that.</p>

<h3>My Question</h3>

<p>I need to add the this class so that I can make some queries, in particular using prepared statements. Can someone give me feed back on what to add to accomplish this.<br>
I am currently calling this class from inside another class like this,</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;_siteRegistry = Registry::singleton();
$this-&gt;_siteRegistry-&gt;storeObject(""PDOExtender"", ""DBO"");
$this-&gt;_DBO = $this-&gt;_siteRegistry-&gt;getObject(""DBO"");

<h3>My Old Way, Without PDO</h3>

<p>In my old projects i just used mysql, but i created the code myself and i'm sure its not the best way to get things done so i'd rather not just use the code i have with pdo integrated.<br>
This is it,</p>

<pre><code>public function runQuery($query, $functionArray = array(), $needResults)
{
    $stmtParam = """";
    $parameters = array();
    $results = array();
    foreach ($functionArray as $v) {
        $stmtParam .= ""s"";
    }
    array_unshift($functionArray, $stmtParam);
    $stmt = $this-&gt;_dbConnection-&gt;prepare($query);
    call_user_func_array(array($stmt, 'bind_param'), $functionArray);
    $stmt-&gt;execute();
    if($needResults) {
        $meta = $stmt-&gt;result_metadata();

<p>Due to a change in the requirements (of course), we now have to update the attributes to a range type, however the Validate plugin isn't interpreting the formatting of the range rule correctly (or perhaps it's more accurate to say I'm not formatting the rule correctly) and now I have problems.</p>

<p>The generated output for the input boxes looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" producttype=""CCC"" code=""ESTFEE"" range=""460, 500"" class=""currency required"" id=""txtEstFeeCCC"" value=""460.00"" name=""txtEstFeeCCC""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" producttype=""CCC"" code=""ESTFEE"" range=""[460, 500]"" class=""currency required"" id=""txtEstFeeCCC"" value=""460.00"" name=""txtEstFeeCCC""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In either case, the message returned is either:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please enter a value between 4 and 6.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please enter a value between NaN and 4</p>
</blockquote>

<p>respectively.  Neither of which has anything to do with the 460 - 500 range in question.</p>

<p>The jQuery code calling the validate function is just the vanilla call:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#btnSave"").click(function() {
    validator.form();
    ... 
    });
</code></pre>

<p>How should an input attribute for jQuery Validate range be formatted so that the correct number range limit is displayed?</p>

<p>I've tried it, but the BindSetter call doesn't seem to accept XML tag names.</p>

<p>When simply using [Bindable] and using the the tag name in MXML (i.e. label text=""{myXMLObject.tagName}"") this works fine, so I figure this has to work in pure AS as well, I just haven't figured out how.</p>

<p>Any hints?</p>

<p>Based on the comments/answer, here is a very basic example of my code/usage.</p>

<p>Two components in a Flex app, both inherit the same XML object;</p>

<pre><code>[Bindable] public var sharedData:XML;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the creationComplete handler of every component, I call the <code>BindSetter</code>;</p>

<pre><code>BindingUtils.bindSetter(sharedDataChange, sharedData, ""tagName"");
</code></pre>

<p><code>sharedDataChange</code> doesn't do anything at this point, just tracing that the function has been called.</p>

<p>I've then got a Label that displays the value of <code>sharedData.tagName</code>, a textInput and a button that sets <code>sharedData.tagName = textInput.text</code>.
Using MXML binding (<code>{label.text = sharedData.tagName}</code>) this works fine. 
But as I said, the BindSetter function doesn't seem to detect the changes.</p>

<pre><code>public NewException()
public NewException(string)
public NewException(string, Exception)
protected or private NewException(SerializationInfo, StreamingContext)
</code></pre>

<p>However, in this case I want to capture some <code>ExceptionContext</code> which has some more information. Currently my code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class NewException : Exception {
  public NewException(ExceptionContext context) 
    : base() {
    if (context == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(""context"");
    this.context = context;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>How do I ensure that an <code>ExceptionContext</code> is set on the <code>NewException</code> while still complying with CA1032?</p>

<p>I could set the context in a property:</p>

<pre><code>public class NewException : Exception {
  public ExceptionContext Context { get { /*get*/ } set { /*null check and set*/ } }
  /*Standard constructors...*/
}
</code></pre>

<p>but now the is no way to make a caller set a <code>ExceptionContext</code>, the class is more verbose because I have to have a backing variable (or no null check on the property), and <code>NewException</code> is mutable.</p>

<p>I notice the ""When to suppress"" section says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule when the violation is caused by using a different access level for the public constructors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not quite sure what is meant by this. Is this saying that I am allowed to write something like this, and then suppress the analysis?</p>

<pre><code>public class NewException : Exception {
  public NewException(ExceptionContext context) 
    : this() {
    if (context == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(""context"");
    this.context = context;

  public NewException(ExceptionContext context, string message)

    this.context = context;
  }

  private NewException(string message) 
    : base(message) { }
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit/additional question:</strong> Do I need to implement <code>NewException(ExceptionContext, SerializationInfo, StreamingContext)</code> or is the point of the <code>SerializationInfo</code> to store other state?</p>

<pre><code>protected NewException(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context) 
  : base (info, context) {
  this.context = new ExceptionContext();
  this.context.Field1 = (T1)info.GetValue(""Field1"", typeof(T1));

There is a point (line 86) where <em>json-to-table.js</em> passes a JSON object and generates array keys to be used as table headers. Optionally, this <code>array_key</code> function can generate only one key for a specified <code>search_value</code> parameter passed. I however [attempted] to modify it so that ALL array keys that did NOT match the <code>search_value</code> would be returned. Here is the function after my changes:</p>

<pre><code>function array_keys(input, search_value, argStrict)
{
    var search = typeof search_value !== 'undefined', tmp_arr = [], strict = !!argStrict, include = '', key = '';

    if (input &amp;&amp; typeof input === 'object' &amp;&amp; input.change_key_case) { // Duck-type check for our own array()-created PHPJS_Array
        return input.keys(search_value, argStrict);
    }

    for (key in input)
    {
        if (input.hasOwnProperty(key))
        {
            include = false;
            if (search)
            {
                if (strict &amp;&amp; input[key] == search_value)
                    include = false;
                else if (input[key] == search_value)
                    include = false;
                else
                    include = true;
            } 
            if (include)
                tmp_arr[tmp_arr.length] = key;
        }
    }
    return tmp_arr;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the reason I did this is because I want my generated table to not include a specific column from my JSON object:
    <code>{
        ""examItemCategories"": [
            {
                ""catgoryName"": ""01-Normal processes"",
                ""catgoryPath"": ""General Area\\01-Normal processes"",
                ""numberOfItems"": 2,
                ""percentage"": ""6.06""
            }
        ]
    }</code></p>

<p>Given that I can not modify the original JSON obj passed, I was determining whether or not to attempt to modify the table post creation (e.g. remove column), or during. After looking at the <code>array_keys</code> function, I felt I could easily inverse the conditional checking for the <code>search_value</code>.</p>

<p>I now call <code>array_keys(parsedJson[0], 'catgoryPath');</code> from json-to-table script. (Yes, <em>catgoryPath</em> is the correctly spelled name haha). Then I set a break point at the for loop within <code>array_keys</code> function to follow it through in Firebug. </p>

<p>1st iteration: <code>catgoryName</code> is added to <code>tmp_arr</code>, 2nd iteration: <code>catgoryPath</code> is added to <code>tmp_arr</code>...and continues through 3rd and 4th iterations. I do not want<code>catgoryPath</code> added.</p>

<p>Looking at script debugger, on the 2nd iteration, whether or not <code>catgoryPath</code> gets added comes down to the conditional: <code>else if (input[key] == search_value)</code> line. The thing is, on the respective iteration both <code>key</code> and <code>search_value</code> variables equal ""catgoryPath"" according to Firebug. So therefore, <code>include = false;</code> should fire correct?</p>

<p>Any help is appreciate, apologies for the length and liberal usage of inline code.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Since this is only part of the total code I thought about putting it all inside of another class called <strong>Functions.java</strong></p>

<pre><code>static public void setPDF (JFrame myFrame, File selectedPDF, String selectedPDFName) {
    // the code I wrote before
}
</code></pre>

<p>And calling it in Finestrella.java:</p>

<pre><code>Functions.setPDF(myFrame, selectedPDF, selectedPDFName);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, I get an error because it says that selectedPDF and selectedPDFName must be declared <strong>final</strong>. The problem is, the variables are created inside <strong>Finestrella.java</strong>, but my method is in <strong>Functions.java</strong>. Also, I need these two variables for a later use within other methods that will be called in Finestrella.java, but that actually are in the other class.</p>

<p>What I tried to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Declaring the arguments of setPDF as final,</li>
<li>Declaring the variables as final in Finestrella.java</li>
</ul>

<p>But I had no luck. I understood what final variables are but, at this point, I think there is definely something wrong with the structure of my program. What I wanted to achieve is having a clean main() method with just the essential functions call located in another class.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is have a class that will make network requests, IE: getUser, getTimeline, getLocation. Once the data has been recieived via <code>-(void)connectionDidFinishLoading:</code> have JSON (for my application I'm using TouchJSON) to parse the the data and with that data return an array or object of it.</p>

<p>All the above I can do, however I find I need to do it in every class I create which leads to a lot of code, and redundant code at that.</p>

<p>Basically if I want to do this approach now this is a rough walkthrough of what happens:</p>

<p>So for example:</p>

<ol>
<li>[View 1]->NetworkActivity Object -> getUser</li>
<li>[NetworkActivity] -> getUser -> makeConnection -> parseObject -> return object</li>
<li>[View 1]->getUser method is now complete and is empty, which in turn now means I have nothing to show</li>
</ol>

<p>Now I understand that because im using Asynchronous request this is why this is happening, however what I'm after is a way to accomplish this approach without having to create several classes that basically do the same thing. I'm not looking for ""the answer"" just a nudge or a point in the right direction of something I can read or try that would better help me understand this.</p>

"1759820","1","","","2009-11-18 23:16:14","","2","690","<p>With the wide variety of web development frameworks that are available, there always seems to be a perpetual incentive to ""try something new"".  Hence, some of us find ourselves trading one framework for another, never being <em>entirely</em> satisfied with the end results.  Granted there will always be niches where a given web framework will serve perfectly.  But, there are many who have settled on using C++, Java or C# for building, say, desktop applications.  The same isn't quite true when it comes to web development applications.  Joel Spolsky touches on this in <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/09/18.html"" rel=""nofollow"">link text</a>.</p>

<p>Let's say if I were to build such a framework: what would the functional requirements be?  The goal here is to list <strong>concrete</strong> functional expectations (defined succinctly for the sake of a stackoverflow posting, of course).  The best answer will be chosen based on its number of votes.</p>

<p>Just to get everyone started, the following would is a partial list of requirements.  Note, these items were intentionally left somewhat abstract with the intent that folks can derive more concrete items from them:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>OOP Consistency: Seamless data exchange and native object representation between server-side and client-side modules</strong>:  That is, given a function on the client-side:  <code>clientFoo()</code> and a function on the server-side: <code>serverFoo()</code> one should be able to pass an object <code>obj</code> of any type <code>T</code> without requiring any marshalling:</p>

<pre><code>define clientFoo() {
    T obj = createObject()
    serverFoo(obj)
}

OR

define serverFoo() {
    T obj = createObject()
    clientFoo(obj)
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>This adds the requirement that native object representations must be the same on both the client and server side, including all composition, inter-class coupling, and encapsulation semantics.  Basically, it should be entirely irrelevant whether a given class or a given instance resides on the client-side or the server-side. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Functional Consistency: Seamless functional and thread execution</strong>:  One should be able to create a function on the client/server side and pass it over the boundary for execution.  This includes uniform support for multi-threading (which should work consistently on both the client and server sides).</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Multiple Application Session Interoperability</strong>:  A perfect example here is inter-application ""cut and paste"" (as mentioned in the article pointed out above).  I am <em>not</em> talking about trivial copying of text within the browser to another browser instance (or tab).  What if one wants to paste say, a contact object in MySocialApp to YetAnotherSocialApp?  This kind of inter-application data exchange is important.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistent cross-Browser compatible UI</strong>: creating AJAX ""dialog boxes"", progress indicators, tabs, etc should all be achievable using an API that is as seamless with the rest of the framework as the client/server integration discussed above.  Oh, and yes, it has to work the same on all browsers (with browser distinctions being completely invisible to the developer).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I'm using VB rather than c# - please don't judge me! :)</p>

<p>I am loading a module on demand, which loads a view into a viewmodel. This view contains custom control which contains a webbrowser control.</p>

<p>I have my application raise events in my module, which when a particular event gets raised, I need to change the URL of this webbrowser that has been loaded above. I can't for the life of me figure out how to create a reference to this control that I can use!</p>

<p>So here are the relevant (I hope!) snippets of the code:</p>

<p>I have a dynamically loaded module, called ExtensionSampleModuleVB:</p>

<pre><code>Public Class ExtensionSampleModuleVB
        Implements IModule
        ReadOnly container As IObjectContainer
        ReadOnly viewManager As IViewManager
        ReadOnly commandManager As ICommandManager
        ReadOnly viewEventManager As IViewEventManager
        'WithEvents interactionManager As Interactions.IInteractionManager
        ReadOnly agentManager As IAgent

        Private WithEvents tmrTimer As New System.Timers.Timer(500)

        Public Sub New(ByVal container As IObjectContainer, ByVal viewManager As IViewManager, ByVal commandManager As ICommandManager, _
                       ByVal viewEventManager As IViewEventManager, ByVal agentManager As IAgent)
            Me.container = container
            Me.viewManager = viewManager
            Me.commandManager = commandManager
            Me.viewEventManager = viewEventManager
            Me.agentManager = agentManager
        End Sub

        Public Sub Initialize() Implements IModule.Initialize

            tmrTimer.Start()

            ' Replacing an already existing view ""DispositionCodeView"" in the Interaction Voice (not the behavior)

            ' Associate the existing ""IDispositionCodeView"" with the new ""DispositionCodeExView"" implementation
            container.RegisterType(Of IDispositionCodeView, DispositionCodeExViewVB)()


            ' Here we register the view (GUI) ""IMySampleView"" and its behavior counterpart ""IMySamplePresentationModel""
            container.RegisterType(Of IMySampleViewVB, MySampleViewVB)()
            container.RegisterType(Of IMySampleViewModelVB, MySampleViewModelVB)()

            ' Put the MySample view in the region ""ToolbarWorkplaceRegion"" (The TabControl in the main toolbar)
            viewManager.ViewsByRegionName(""ToolbarWorkplaceRegion"").Insert(0, New ViewActivator() With { _
              .ViewType = GetType(IMySampleViewVB), _
              .ViewName = ""MySampleVB"" _
            })

            ' Here we register the view (GUI) ""IMySampleMenuView""
            container.RegisterType(Of IMySampleMenuViewVB, MySampleMenuViewVB)()

            ' Put the MySampleMenuView view in the region ""WorkspaceMenuRegion"" (The Workspace toggle button in the main toolbar)
            viewManager.ViewsByRegionName(""WorkspaceMenuRegion"").Insert(0, New ViewActivator() With { _
              .ViewType = GetType(IMySampleMenuViewVB), _
              .ViewName = ""MySampleMenuVB"", _
              .ActivateView = True _
            })

// ...continued...
</code></pre>

<p>My XAML Control is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl x:Class=""ExtensionSampleVB.MySampleVB.MySampleViewVB""
    xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
    xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""
     MinHeight=""90""&gt;

    &lt;Grid&gt;
        &lt;WebBrowser x:Name=""webBrowser"" Source=""http://www.google.com"" 
          Width=""600"" Height=""600""  /&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/UserControl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The code behind this control contains the following subs, I need to call the 'SetURLValue' method, and pass a URI, so that the web browser is updated:</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub SetURL_orig(ByVal strURL As Uri) 'Implements IMySampleViewVB.SetURL

    webBrowser.Navigate(strURL)

End Sub

Private Delegate Sub SetBrowserURI_Delegate(ByVal webURI As Uri)

Private Sub SetURLValue(ByVal uriAddress As System.Uri)

    If Dispatcher.CheckAccess Then
        'webBrowser.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(Me.SetBrowserURI, System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority.Background, uriAddress)

        SetURL_orig(uriAddress)

    Else

        Me.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(New SetBrowserURI_Delegate(AddressOf SetURL_orig), uriAddress)

    End If

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone assist? Is there any more code you need from me?
The Control gets loaded into the view fine, I don't have any issues with that. It's just calling this method from my module which is proving difficult for me.</p>

<p>I appreciate any assistance anyone can provide!
Cheers,

<ul>
<li>A user could fill in none, some, or all fields.</li>
<li>The query searches in a table for a record that matches all the requirements.</li>

<p>Now I have done my research, and I found out multiple ways on doing this. But none of them work, and if they do, they are far from practical.</p>

<p>At the moment I'm creating a query like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM assignments 
WHERE (id = $id OR id = '') 
  AND (field1 = $field1 OR field1 = '')

<p>This query works, but only if you fill in all the fields.</p>

<p>I got this from a stackoverflow article, that I can't find anymore, that said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the user has filled in an input field it will check the first rule
  ""id = $input"" 
      and if the user hasn't specified any input it will check for ""id = '' "" and when it 
      checks for that, it will just return everything. Because it escapes the empty search rule.</p>

<p>Making <em>every</em> script-containing directory read-only is the only solution that I know of (prevents generation of <code>.pyc</code> files in the first place) but I would rather avoid it if possible.</p>

<p>A little rundown, of how the app normally works: filters accept <code>lookup_type</code> parameter. They behave like django forms, eg.</p>

<p><code>filters.py</code></p>

<pre><code>class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
    price = django_filters.NumberFilter(lookup_type='lt')
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>views.py</code></p>

<pre><code>from .filters import ProductFilter

def product_list(request):
    filtered_data = ProductFilter(request.GET, queryset=Product.objects.all())
    return render(request, 'template.html', {'f': filtered_data})
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine but what if I wanted a site visitor be able to specify <code>lookup_type</code> explicitly and filter based on his choice? One solution I came up with, was to take all the code from <code>filters.py</code> to <code>views.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def product_list(request):
    lookup_type_user = request.GET.get('lookup_type', 'exact')

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
         price = django_filters.NumberFilter(lookup_type=lookup_type_user)

    filtered_data = ProductFilter(request.GET, queryset=Product.objects.all())
    # ...
</code></pre>

<p>This works but I'd like to keep the code in separate files. Do you have any ideas maybe?</p>

I have other tables, which have that identical field: <code>Field('block_location', 'reference block'),</code> but they don't have any problem with values above 1. What is wrong here?</p>

<p>One other thing that comes in mind is that I had the same problem before with that table and I realized I had made a typo: <code>Field('block_location', 'reference ore'),</code> so I referenced a wrong table and that table <code>ore</code> only had one entry (thus accepting only 1 and nothing else). But now even though I fixed it, the problem persists. Could there be some traces of that former line somewhere in the DAL? I truncated both tables (<code>block</code> and <code>block_processing_line_1</code>after fixing.</p>

<p>i think the problem is with all the encoding that are going inside these methods</p>

<h3>Sample Data</h3>

<p>plainText = stackoverflow</p>

<p><code>base64encoded Key = B8Y/6doxwqU870C6jzYWhsr3hKSLokAOkkLCDiy+TS4=</code>
(should be easy to convert to bytes ain't it)</p>

<p><code>base64encoded IV = NZIpD60eBmdsOFFhA2bfvw==</code></p>

<p><code>encryptedValue = 77+977+977+977+977+9Ce+/ve+/vQ3vv70F77+9UzHvv73vv70=</code></p>

<p>I provide same encrypted value , IV and Key to decrypt to Stackoverflow</p>

Let me explain the application. There is DataGrid and a <code>frame</code> in <code>MainPage</code>. User enters some datas and after clicking <code>Search</code> button, service gets datas from database and fills the DataGrid. And after this, user can select row and application changes URI of the frame from the ViewModel like that:</p>

<pre><code>// Sending selectedId as Query string
FrameURI = new Uri(
                   string.Format(""/Views/PersonDetails.xaml?SelectedID={0}"",
                   SelectedID,
                   UriKind.Relative);
</code></pre>

<p>I am getting datas of the person with the given ID in <code>OnNavigatedTo</code> event and calling a method which return object with the type of Person:</p>

<pre><code>    _id = this.NavigationContext.QueryString[""SelectedID""];

    if (_id != """")
    {
        Uri address = new Uri(Application.Current.Host.Source, ""../UserServiceName.svc""); 
        UserServiceNameClient client = new UserServiceNameClient(""CustomBinding_UserServiceName"", address.AbsolutePath);

        client.GetPersonByIDCompleted += (sender, event) =&gt;
            {
                   if (e.Result.Name != null)
                   {
                         LayoutRoot.DataContext = (Person)e.Result;
                   }
            };
        client.GetPersonByIDAsync(_id);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>But the problem is here. It seems that GC is not kicking in after selecting new id from the DataGrid. After changing selected row in DataGrid, memory of the application keeps growing up. And the storyboards/animations become laggy...</p>

<p>I have read some posts in web, some of them tell that, it is about <code>event handlers</code>. I have tried somethings, but didn't help.</p>

<p>The functions _draw_black_piece, _draw_white_piece, etc. are all basically written the same. They take a fractional coordinate and draw a piece of that color. The coordinates are determined by the size of the board after it is resized. The default size of the board is the number of pieces in each column and row times the RADIUS constant, which is set to 100.</p>

<pre><code>def _draw_black_piece(self, x_frac: float, y_frac: float) -&gt; None:

    self._canvas.create_oval(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill = 'black')

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zsTDj.png"" alt=""Debug Output""></p>

<p>An expert at work recommended another solution that I'm going to try that involves passing in the context when subscribing.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2015-06-16 Tue 5:30 PM PST</p>

<p>I got help creating an <a href=""https://github.com/ctaggart/paket/compare/powershell...SubscribeOn"" rel=""nofollow"">IObservable.SubscribeOn</a> that allows the SynchrnonizationContext to be passed in. Unfortunately, it doesn't solve the problem eithe, but may be part of the solution. May be a custom SynchronizationContext is needed like that <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2012/01/20/10259049.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">SingleThreadSynchrnonizationContext</a>. I would love help making one, but before I do that, I'm going to try out System.Reactive's <code>Observable.ObserveOn(Scheduler.CurrentThread)</code>.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2015-06-16 Tue 8:30 PM PST</p>

<p>I haven't been able to get Rx to work either. <code>Scheduler.CurrentThread</code> <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13408341/observeonscheduler-currentthread-doesnt-cause-subscribed-action-to-be-run-on"">doesn't behave</a> the way I was hoping. I then tried out <a href=""https://github.com/ctaggart/paket/compare/powershell...rx"" rel=""nofollow"">these changes</a> and the callback doesn't get called.</p>

<pre><code>member x.RegisterTrace() =
    Logging.verbose &lt;- x.Verbose
    let a = Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId
    let ctx = match SynchronizationContext.Current with null -&gt; SynchronizationContext() | sc -&gt; sc
    let sch = SynchronizationContextScheduler ctx

<p>The mutex ""id"" is a guid and name conflicts are impossible.<br>
This is the only code that can create that mutex, and it grants full access to it for all users (my processes can be run under different user credentials). </p>

<p>Any ideas, why this unauthorized access error might happen?</p>

<p>However, when cross-compiling with GCC for MIPS 32-bit architecture, I encounter a link error regarding missing reference to __sync_fetch_and_add_8.

<p>I have written a VBA procedure (initiated in Excel 2010) which loops around an array containing different Excel files. The loop opens the file, refreshes the data, saves and closes the file for each item in the array. I have written an error catch sub routine so I log which excel files have failed to open/refresh/save etc so a user can manually check them.</p>

<p>Some files are quite large and involve a large amount of data moving across the network; sometimes I get a dialog box with: <em>Excel is waiting for another application to complete an OLE action</em>.</p>

<p>I could use Application.DisplayAlerts = False to disable the message but this would presumably disable all alerts so I couldn't catch the errors? </p>

<p>Further I have tested using the line and it doesn't stop the dialog box pop-up. If I press enter it carries on but will likely pop-up again a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Is there a way to stop is message specifically without stopping other alerts?</p>

<p>NB. My process has a control instance of Excel which runs the VBA and opens the workbooks to be refreshed in a separate instance. </p>

<p><strong>CSS:</strong></p>

<p>You can see the log in Console showing that every time you create a new event by clicking in a date, it loops through all existing events by calling <code>eventAfterRender</code>.</p>

<p>So question:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How to trigger once after new event created?</p></li>
<li><p>How to property bind that event DOM with <code>popover</code> and have extra data (like <code>description</code> key)? I don't want to just query to DOM to show the title.</p></li>

<p>NB: I'm aware I could use <code>ValidateSet</code> for similar functionality; however that has the disadvantage of only having a name value; as opposed to allowing me to program using friendly names which are then mapped to ints in the background (I could write code for that; but enum seems more appropriate if possible).</p>

<p>This works wonderfully, generating great ticks until I zoom down into weeks, at which point I need to be able to dictate what day of the week ticks show for (Sunday, monday, etc.). I am aware of the multiformat custom generator for tickFormat in which you can specify the format given the appropriate interval. That will not change the ticks, however. Is there a way to set the start of the weeks' rules while maintaining the tick generation that otherwise exists at the year, month, day (etc.) level? Can the default start date be set to some other day of the week for the d3 library?</p>

<p>Initially I thought that Rails would automatically parse the JSON in the params and I could access them in the normal way. So I wrote the Registrations Controller like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Api::RegistrationsController &lt; Devise::RegistrationsController

  skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token
  respond_to :json

  def create

    @user = User.new(user_params)

    if @user.save
      render json: @user.as_json( email: @user.email), status: 201
      return
    else
      warden.custom_failure!
      render json: @user.errors, status: 422
    end
  end

  def user_params
    params.require(:'data.json').permit(:email, :name, :phone, :comments, :residency, :qualification, :acknowledgement) if params.present?
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>However, it is simply not working at all. I get an error undefined method 'permit' for string. So obviously I'm not accessing the JSON correctly. Is it possible that because the JSON is escaped that it's throwing the errors?</p>

<p>I've been googling and asking in IRC for a couple of days but I'm not any farther ahead. </p>

<p>I can pass a properly formatted JSON to the controller and it works fine (with changes to the require arguments)</p>

<p>I'm stumped since I need to be able to create a new user with the JSON data. Any help would be HUGELY appreciated. I just don't know what direction to even go from here.</p>

I have fixed all of the problems in my Main function so far, but then I uncommented my Blob function call and an error came up that I apparently just can not figure out.

<p>I believe it has something do with the **'s that I added to fix a previous problem with my 2D array (which is required for the assignment). I have included the comments at the top of the code to clarify the objectives of the program. </p>

<p>Also, the first line of the array that is output is offset 10 spaces to the left. Column 13 should have an 'X', but it shows up at 3. I have changed the values of the array manually so that arr[0][12] = 'X' (before the array is printed out) but the position did not change. I can still use the program without this being fixed because it will only be a few points off.</p>

         SUMMARY 
           This program will read in data from a file and store it in a two-dimensional array. 
           From there it will detect all of the groupings of characters, or ""blobs"", in the file and count them.

         INPUT 
           The program will read in information from a file called ""blob.txt"".

           BAD DATA CHECKING: 
                N/A

         OUTPUT 
            The program will output the amount of blobs in the file.

         DATA STRUCTURES
            N/A

         ASSUMPTIONS  
          -The file will have 20 records. Each record will be 70 characters long and the character 
            will be either an X or a blank space/whitespace.

Only found threads on people not invoking the method correctly. (perhaps this thread will join those ranks! :) )</p>

<p>Let's say I have two following recurrence relations for computing <em>S(i,j)</em> </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/EAJ7T.png"" alt=""S_{i,j+1} = X_{PA}S_{i,j} + \frac{1}{2p}(iS_{i-1,j}+jS_{i,j-1}) \\ S_{i+1,j} = X_{PB}S_{i,j} + \frac{1}{2p}(iS_{i-1,j}+jS_{i,j-1})""></p>

<p>I would like to compute values <em>S(0,0)</em>, <em>S(0,1)</em>, <em>S(1,0)</em>, <em>S(2,0)</em>, etc... in asymptotically optimal way. Few minutes with pencil and paper reveal that it unfolds into treelike structure which can be transversed in several ways. Now, it's unlikely tree will be useful later on, so for now I'm looking to produce nested list like <code>[[S(00)],[S(10),S(01)],[S(20),S(21),S(12),S(02)],...]</code>. I have created a function to produce a flat list of <em>S(i,0)</em> (or <em>S(0,j)</em>, depending on first argument):</p>

<pre><code>osrr xpa p predexp = os00 : os00 * (xpa + rp) : zipWith3 osrr' [1..] (tail osrr) osrr
  where
    osrr' n a b = xpa * a + rp * n * b
    os00  = sqrt (pi/p) * predexp
    rp    = recip (2*p)
</code></pre>

<p>I am, however, at loss as how to proceed further.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2/UPDATE:</strong> 
This question was asked quite a while ago. At that time, I wanted to write everything in one line so I would use trinary operators and nest built in function calls in favor of foreach. That was not a good practice! Write code that is readable, whether it's concise doesn't matter that much.</p>

<p>In this case: putting the foreach in a function will be much more readable and modular than writing a one-liner(Even though all the answers are great :)).</p>

Some of them (notably <code>git-svn</code> man page) warns <em>against</em> using merge anywhere near the branch I plan to <code>dcommit</code> from.</p>

<p>Others, like this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/4238528/465345"">SO answer</a>, state that merging is fine as long as I use <strong>one-off</strong> feature branches that I delete before <code>dcommitting</code>.</p>

<p>I have a setup with two long-living SVN (and git) branches:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>trunk</strong> (git-svn: <code>svn/trunk</code>, git: <code>master</code>) - the stable branch</li>
<li><strong>branches/devel</strong> (git-svn: <code>svn/devel</code>, git: <code>devel</code>) - the main development branch from which I fork off feature branches (and I can live with rebasing them back into <code>devel</code> instead of merging).</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/EwZNb.png"" alt=""Snapshot of current state in Source Tree""></p>

<p>In the picture above, <strong>(1)</strong> shows past SVN history, where <code>branches/devel</code> has been merged into <code>trunk</code>.</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> shows that I have successfully <code>dcommitted</code> my current development back into SVN.</p>

<p><strong>The question:</strong> can I use <code>git-svn</code> to merge <strong>two SVN branches</strong> so that history shows the merge point (as SVN itself can do)? In other words: what happens if I were to <code>dcommit</code> from <code>master</code> as shown in <strong>(3)</strong>?</p>

<p>Will this mess up my SVN (or git) history? Or will this just plain forget that <code>devel</code> was merged into <code>master</code> at all?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> If <code>git</code> just forgets that <code>devel</code> was merged into <code>master</code>, is there a difference between <code>dcommiting</code> from point <strong>(3)</strong> and applying all the commits as a single <strong>patch</strong>?</p>

I have a multiple sets of instructions for the skeleton consisting of force application to legs, arms, torso etc. and duration of force applied to their respective bone. Each set of instructions (behavior) is developed by testing its effectiveness performing the desired behavior, and then modifying the behavior with a genetic algorithm with other similar behaviors, and testing it again. The skeleton will have an array behaviors in its set list.</p>

<p>I have fitness functions which test for stability, speed, minimization of entropy and force on joints. The problem is that any given behavior will work for a specific context. One behavior works on flat ground, another works if there is a bump in front of the right foot, another if it's in front of the left, and so on. So the fitness of each behavior varies based on the context. Picking a behavior simply on its previous fitness level won't work because that fitness score doesn't apply to this context.</p>

<p>My question is, how do I program to have the skeleton pick the best behavior for the context? Such as picking the best walking behavior for a randomized bumpy terrain.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/HAKf7.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/HAKf7.png"" alt=""Next screen, resizing fails""></a></p>

<p>So everything works fine (pressing the <code>to main screen</code> button takes you back to the original screen), except for the scaling an positioning of the buttons and images.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the window stay the same, but the image gets reverted to its original size (which is 500x500) and put at coords (0,0).</p>

<p>Any ideas or suggestions on how to solve this? I'm breaking my head over this one, can't seem to get it right... I want it to be just like the first screen.</p>

        if (ScreenManager.getCurrentScreen() != null) {
            ScreenManager.getCurrentScreen().render();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void resize(int width, int height) {

<p>I am currently making my own template system for a website in which I can replace template placeholders in the style of {$stuff} with php code. I have the following code for this:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Replace a default placeholder.
 *
 * @access    public
 * @param     string $replace     Placeholder name
 * @param     string $replacement Text with which to replace placeholder.
 * @uses      $leftDelimiter
 * @uses      $rightDelimiter
 * @uses      $template
 */
public function assign($replace, $replacement) {
    $this-&gt;template = str_replace( $this-&gt;leftDelimiter .$replace.$this-&gt;rightDelimiter,
                                   $replacement, $this-&gt;template );
}
</code></pre>

<p>leftDelimiter and rightDelimiter in this case are {$ and }, respectively.</p>

<p>Now I want to add a new function that dynamically parses placeholders containing numbers - say, {$image_1}, {$image_2}, {$image_3} and lets me use the numbers contained within for my replacement code, for example so that I replace {$image_1337} with a mysql database entry from a row with id ""1337"".</p>

<p>How would I go about doing that? Extensive Google search and asking friends has, sadly, failed me due to my lack of coding vocabulary and explanation ability. It likely has to do with regular expressions, but I absolutely cannot wrap my brain around them and all attempts to construct a fitting one have failed me.</p>

<p>Instructions were pretty simple... I modified ~/.subversion/servers and set http-proxy-host=10.0.6.251.  I also modified my Eclipse preferences->General->Network connections to use the proxy. Piece of cake so far.  It worked like that for years.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2014, and the network wonks have gone proxyless.  Consequently, I have reconfigured my Subversion distribution to remove the firewall settings - simply removing the http-proxy-host and http-proxy-port entries.  I've also removed every trace of the proxy from Eclipse.</p>

<p>I've rebooted, relaunched everything, etc.. but my environment is still trying to use the proxy:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Note that 10.0.6.251:3128 is the ip/port of the old (unneeded) proxy server.  The one that I removed.  <strong>Only SVN is complaining about this, everything else works ok</strong></p>

<p>My question: where else might SVN be reading this proxy server information from?  As far as I can tell, every reference to it has been removed.  It's NOT being set in my environment, in the subversion servers file, or in Eclipse (as far as I can tell).</p>

<p>Anyone else have any ideas where I could look?</p>

<p>Edit 1:</p>

<p>I had the suspicion that the proxy settings might be set in java properties, so I did this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Prop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties p = System.getProperties();
        Enumeration keys = p.keys();
        while (keys.hasMoreElements()) {
          String key = (String)keys.nextElement();
          String value = (String)p.get(key);
          System.out.println(key + "": "" + value);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>No luck at all.  Phantom proxy server is in none of the system properties visible to Java.  Also checked the Java control panel in Mac OSX system properties, and my connection is set to ""Direct"".</p>

<p>Edit 2: The Plot Thickens</p>

<p>So I'm looking around in Eclipse and I notice this message:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5kFxQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>And I'm certain this is the cause of it.  I just have no idea what in my external environment (Mac OSX Mavericks) is setting this.  If I use SVN after Eclipse has reset the value using what I have in preference, SVN works.  But then something in my environment overrides it again and it fails, sometimes in mid-sync.</p>

<p>This centers the green container, but it overlaps with the blue on smaller screen.</p>

To be clear, this is /_vti_bin/Lists.asmx. The setup is I have one WSS 3.0 site which connects via soap to the lists service of another, WSS/MOSS site. On our stage environment these two sites are on the same box, but in dev they're seperate. Whatever the situation, they're all on the same domain. Originally (prior to a rebuild) the web service calls worked fine in dev, but not in stage, which while puzzling at least confirmed that my implementation of the web service is correct, and the issue is one of authorisation. Here is my initial Lists service setup code:</p>

<pre><code>new Lists
{
     Url = Utility.AppSetting(""WSS.Url"", true),
     Credentials = new NetworkCredential
     {
           UserName = Utility.AppSetting(""WSS.UserName"", true),
           Password = Utility.AppSetting(""WSS.Password"", true),
           Domain = Utility.AppSetting(""WSS.Domain"", true)
     }
};
</code></pre>

<p>With me manually specifying the domain credentials of the full access account on the server. However I suspect that the above code doesn't do anything and the service just authenticates using AD, i.e. my app pool account (which on dev is my super powered dev account). To lesson the burden on the release process, I would like to be able to explicitly set the credentials for the service, and not rely on the infrastructure official having to give his app pool account read/web service access to a remote wss instance.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>My concern/question is this, is it feasible/advised to mix/integrate the following technologies?</p>

<ul>
<li>CCS3 + HTML5 + JavaScript (particularly, using Twitter Bootstrap framework)</li>
<li>JSF 2.0 </li>
<li>Facelets</li>
</ul>

<p>And if so, when working with a web designer what are the things that JSF 2.0 is going to make more difficult for me. For example, when integrating the web design into the application I guess I'll have to do some modifications: inserting JSF tags and EL expressions, deal with JavaScript in some special way(?), working through HTML tags incompatibilities(?), etc.</p>

<p>Having the same issue with both. Which is, the pdf conversion fails when I try and reference a stylesheet that imports parts of bootstrap.</p>

<pre><code>html = render_to_string(partial: ""users/direct_deposit_info.html"", layout: ""layouts/pdf"")
UserMailer.send_email(current_user.email,'Direct Deposit Information',content, html)

<p>And this is what's in the stylesheet that keeps breaking things and causing it to fail:
This is my print.css.scss:</p>

<pre><code>@import 'bootstrap/variables';
@import 'bootstrap/print';
@import 'general';
</code></pre>

<p>This is what I'm doing in my layouts/pdf. If I remove the reference to the 'print' stylesheet, it will convert to pdf successfully and everything works fine except my pdf is not completely styled. If I keep the 'print' reference in, then it breaks</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= wicked_pdf_stylesheet_link_tag ""fonts"" %&gt;
&lt;%= wicked_pdf_stylesheet_link_tag ""print"" %&gt;

<p>So my question is, in Rails, is there a way to get the css from these imports into my html without it freaking out?</p>

<p>I need the bootstrap print and variables css so that way my general.css file has access to the variables that the bootstrap files contain.</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em>
If I add a normal rails stylesheet link tag to 'print.css.scss' this is what I get in my rendered html file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link href=""//localhost:3000/assets/print.css?body=1"" media=""screen"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If I use the wicked_pdf_stylsheet_link_tag ""print"", then I get the same error and in my rendered html file there is no link reference or anything.</p>

<p>I want to update the <code>'rating'</code> field of dishes.</p>

$newdata = array('$set' =&gt; array(""dishes""=&gt; array(""rating"" =&gt; ""11"")));

<p>It's giving me error like:</p>

<p>Hello. Again I stuck in playframework. This is simple working example from <code>play new app</code>:
<strong>main.scala.html</strong></p>

<pre><code>@(title: String, scripts: Html = Html(""""))(content: Html)
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;@title&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" media=""screen"" href=""@routes.Assets.at(""stylesheets/main.css"")""&gt;
        &lt;link rel=""shortcut icon"" type=""image/png"" href=""@routes.Assets.at(""images/favicon.png"")""&gt;
        &lt;script src=""@routes.Assets.at(""javascripts/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"")"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        @scripts
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        @content
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And I've got index.scala.html :</p>

<pre><code>@scripts = {
    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;alert(""hello !"");&lt;/script&gt;
}
@main(""Welcome to Play 2.0"", scripts) {
    Welcome
}
</code></pre>

<p>or (without <code>scripts</code>):</p>

<pre><code>@main(""Welcome to Play 2.0"") {
    Welcome
}
</code></pre>

<p>It works perfect. But when I put <code>scripts: Html = Html("""")</code> into another <code>main.scala.html</code> in IntelliJea project it is not working. </p>

<p>This code even worked about 1 hour ealier and <code>magically</code> stop working so what is wrong with it?</p>

<pre><code>@(title: String, scripts: Html = Html(""""))(content: Html)
@import play.api.i18n._
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;@title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src=""@routes.Assets.at(""javascripts/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"")"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    @scripts
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;a href=""""&gt;@Messages(""home"")&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div id=""content""&gt;
@content
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/BcXID.png"" alt=""What I did wrong""></p>

<p>Also I put stacktrace:</p>

<p>This works in Chrome by the way.</p>

<p>And then it gets down to line 186 and it looks like it just completely ignores that entire block, as evidenced by the fact that the alert doesn't happen.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<pre><code>getPlaylist(function(songs) {
        alert(""test"");
            // if (shuffle==1){songs=songs.sort( randOrd );}
            // playlistFromXML = songs;
            // playlistFromXML = JSON.parse(songs);
            // alert(playlistFromXML);
var mediaPlaylist = new Playlist(""1"", songs, {
    ready: function() {
        mediaPlaylist.displayPlaylist();
        mediaPlaylist.playlistInit(false); // Parameter is a boolean for autoplay.
    },
    ended: function() {
        mediaPlaylist.playlistNext();
    },
    swfPath: ""js"",
    supplied: ""ogv, m4v, oga, mp3""
}); 
         });
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: hmm you are right, okay got the alert working...but on the page, it doesn't load any songs in the jplayer like it does in chrome. maybe this isn't where the problem lies...</p>

<p>THANKS for all your help everyone. I think I better take this to the jplayer forums.</p>

<p>for those who care, it ended up being a problem with my jplayer code. I had the wrong swfpath, since i had moved the js folder to a subfolder. This was only a problem with IE because jplayer has a flash fallback for older browsers that don't do HTML5 very well.</p>

The decorator has to implement the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#with-statement-context-managers"" rel=""nofollow"">context manager protocol</a> (i.e. turn the wrapped function into a context manager), so I figured I needed to wrap the function with a class.</p>

<p>I'm not really experienced with the decorator pattern and have never implemented a context manager before, but what I wrote works in Python 2.7 and it also works in Python 3.3 if I comment out the <code>wraps</code> line.</p>

<pre><code>from functools import wraps
def _file_reader(func):
    """"""A decorator implementing the context manager protocol for functions

            self.args = args
            self.kwargs = kwargs
            self.close = kwargs.get('close', True)

        def __enter__(self):
            # _file_obj is a little helper that opens the file for reading
            self.fsource = _file_obj(self.source, 'r') 
            return func(self.fsource, *self.args, **self.kwargs)

        def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
            if self.close:
                self.fsource.close()
            return False
    return CManager
</code></pre>

<p>The error I get when uncommenting the <code>wraps</code> line occurs inside <code>update_wrapper</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/lib/python3.3/functools.py in update_wrapper(wrapper, wrapped, assigned, updated)
     54             setattr(wrapper, attr, value)
     55     for attr in updated:
---&gt; 56         getattr(wrapper, attr).update(getattr(wrapped, attr, {}))
     57     # Return the wrapper so this can be used as a decorator via partial()
     58     return wrapper

AttributeError: 'mappingproxy' object has no attribute 'update'
</code></pre>

<p>I know the docs don't say that I even can use <a href=""http://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.wraps"" rel=""nofollow""><code>functools.wraps</code></a> to wrap a function with a class like this, but then again, it just works in Python 2. Can someone please explain what exactly this traceback is telling me and what I should do to achieve the effects of <code>wraps</code> on both versions of Python?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I was mistaken. The code above does <strong>not</strong> do what I want it to. I want to be able to use the function both <em>with</em> and <em>without</em> <code>with</code>, like the builtin <code>open</code>.</p>

<p>The code above turns the decorated function into a context manager. I want to be able to do:</p>

<pre><code>reader = func('source.txt', arg)
for item in reader:
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>as well as</p>

<pre><code>with func('source.txt', arg) as reader:
    for item in reader:
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>So my version of the code should probably look approximately as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def _file_reader(func):
    """"""A decorator implementing the context manager protocol for functions
    that read files.""""""
    @wraps(func)
    class CManager:
        def __init__(self, source, *args, **kwargs):
            self.close = kwargs.get('close', True)
            self.fsource = _file_obj(source, 'r')
            self.reader = func(self.fsource, *args, **kwargs)

        def __enter__(self):
            return self.reader

        def __iter__(self):
            return self.reader

        def __next__(self):
            return next(self.reader)

        def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
            if self.close and not self.fsource.closed:
                self.fsource.close()
            return False
    return CManager
</code></pre>

<p>Feel free to comment about anything I have overlooked.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: the class version by J.F. Sebastian seems to work then:</p>

<p>I basically removed the <code>wraps</code> from the class and changed <code>return CManager</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>@wraps(func)
def helper(*args, **kwargs):
    return CManager(*args, **kwargs)
return helper

And up until now, the Beta users haven't been changing that quickly, so it's been pretty easy to just add a new device to the provisioning file and post a new build whenever needed.  But, we've recently started to quickly expand the pool of Beta users and posting a new build to TestFlight every time we want to add a new user doesn't seem like the ideal solution any longer.  So I know they have the feature which lets you upload a new profile with a new device(s) in the new profile, which I'm trying to use.  So at that point I then have the new user attempt to install the app and the TestFlight WebClip asks the user to install the new profile (since it's no longer embedded in the app like with the initial build/provisioning file).  The user successfully installs the new profile but when going back to the TestFlight app/webclip, just repeatedly gets asked to install the profile again without being able to actually install the app.</p>

<p>OK, a complete walk through of the details:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I build an app with the testUsers1.mobileprovision file and upload it
to TestFlight.</p></li>
<li><p>At some point later I add UserX to a new mobile provisioning file,
testUsers2.mobileprovision.</p></li>
<li><p>Under the permissions section of the old build, I use ""Update
profile"" to load testUsers2 up to TestFlight.</p></li>
<li><p>UserX then starts up the TestFlight webclip/app on their device.</p></li>
<li><p>Rather than installing/downloading the app, TestFlight asks them to
install the new testUsers2 provisioning file and the user does
install the file.</p></li>
<li><p>UserX then restarts TestFlight on the device and it again asks them
to install the new profile instead of actually installing/downloading
the app.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I've written to TestFlight asking for any ideas of what could be going wrong with this, but haven't received an answer yet.  Anyone see what I'm doing wrong here?  Or am I hitting a bug of some sort in the TestFlight Webclip on the device?</p>

<p>Update:
I've traded a couple of emails with TestFlight and they've replied with ""While we troubleshoot this issue, the best thing we can recommend is to re-upload the same build with the new provisioning profile associated with it. It will not create a new version, but will update the most current version in TestFlight.""</p>

<p>So, hopefully they'll have an answer shortly.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>and I am trying to search the first_name field, the last_name field, the nationality field, and the experience field, but say if the first_name field is blank, I need to pass an empty value so it returns all rows, then filter from there with last name the same way, for some reason it is not working at all for me. this is my sqs:</p>

<pre><code>results = SearchQuerySet().models(Person).filter(first_name=sname, last_name=slastname, nationality=scountry, experience__pk=sexperience)

However in the live machine, for SOME words, I get a xmlhttp.status 500 ( internal server error ).</p>

<p>js code:</p>

<pre><code>    xmlhttp.open(""GET"",""displaySense_GET.php?SenseParameters=""+strParams,true);
    xmlhttp.send();
</code></pre>

<p>so in the live machine, there are some particular strParams such as ""<strong>115744@909@0@115744@115744@specific_word</strong>"" for which the .php file crashes with internal server error. ( for the majority of words it works well though ).</p>

<p>So i thought, hey let's hit in my browser the .php file to see what happens</p>

<pre><code>http://livemachine.com/displaySense_GET.php?SenseParameters=115744@909@0@115744@115744@specific_word
</code></pre>

<p><strong>and in my browser it DOES NOT crash, instead it returns the correct results! In other words, it only crashes ( code 500 ) when it's retrieved via AJAX and only for some particular combinations of the parameter ""SenseParameters"" such as ""115744@909@0@115744@115744@specific_word"". Again, this is valid for the live machine, in the dev one, it never crashes.</strong></p>

<p>maybe it helps ... displaySense_GET.php looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

require_once('dirpath.php');

if ( isset($_GET['SenseParameters']) ) {

    $senseparams = trim($_GET['SenseParameters']);

    $strRes = """";
    $output="""";
    if (strlen($senseparams) &gt; 1) {
        try {
            $senseparams = str_replace(""@"", ""#"", $senseparams);
            $obj = new COM(""dllname.ExtFunctions"") or die(""Unable to instantiate dllname"");
            $output = $obj-&gt;fnInitialize(""lang"", $APPLICATIONDIRECTORY . ""\\lex"", $APPLICATIONDIRECTORY . ""\\dll"", ""utf8"");
            $output = $obj-&gt;fnBringSense($senseparams);
            $strRes = $output;

            echo $strRes;
        }
        catch (Exception $e) {
            echo ""Fatal error: "" . $e-&gt;getMessage() . "" :internal error"";
        }
    }   
} else {
    echo ""error:displaySense"";
}

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone could help with why this happens? and maybe the fact that if i hit the url directly it doesn't crash, but if i call it through javascript it returns status 500, tells you something?</p>

<p>( the words are in utf8 - not english but that shouldn't be a problem, if it were, it would crash for all words ).</p>

<p>p.s. what's even more extraordinary is that, it won't crash in the </p>

<pre><code>$obj-&gt;fnBringSense($senseparams);
</code></pre>

<p>line which uses the parameter and does the actual search in the dictionary, it will crash in the</p>

<pre><code>$obj-&gt;fnInitialize(""lang"", $APPLICATIONDIRECTORY . ""\\lex"", $APPLICATIONDIRECTORY . ""\\dll"", ""utf8"");
</code></pre>

<p>line, which does not use the parameter and just does a general initialization.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p><strong>the error will not be caught in the exception, thus returning a valid status=200, it will instead retun a status 500 in the ajax call</strong></p>

<p>We're trying to come up with an idea for a simple program to send out to people, backed by a database.  At a simplistic level, there will be a ""User"" object, which just has name and email.  The program just allows someone to edit the name and email, and all is good</p>

<p>Then we want other developers to be able to add their own fields, and write a ""plug-in"" to edit it.  So, I've got a copy of the program, I've been able to write my plugin that adds ""comany name"" to the form - and it could stand alone with the data layer, but the problem with this method is that you end up running two database commands</p>

<p>select name, email from user
select companyname from user</p>

<p>Ideally, it would be really cool if the plugin to add something to the datalayer to say, include companyname on user, then you only have one command</p>

<p>select name, email, companyname from user</p>

    var start = $(div).offset().top;

    $.event.add(window, ""scroll"", function() {
        var p = $(window).scrollTop();
        $(div).css('position',((p)&gt;start) ? 'fixed' : 'static');
        $(div).css('top',((p)&gt;start) ? '0px' : '');
    });

});
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.10 I can't do that. I get this warning:</p>

<pre><code>mount: warning: content seems to be mounted read-only.
</code></pre>

<p>While browsing for answers I see that many people accept the answer that ""ISO 9660 images are not supposed to be mounted in a writeable state"".
That may be so, but UDF is not ISO9660. UDF is ISO13346, and it <strong>is</strong> supposed to be mountable in a writeable state.</p>

<p>See these links:</p>

</ul>

<p>In desperation I have tried the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>sudo chmod 777 on both the UDF image and the mounting point (before mounting)</li>
<li>sudo chown myself.myself on the mounting point (after mounting)</li>
<li>sudo mount -o remount,rw someImage.udf /tmp/cdr</li>
</ul>

<p>But I'm not getting anywhere.
Hoping someone can help.</p>

<p>The info i got till now is that we need to fetch values for OID from MIB files of a SNMP enabled Printer. I want this app to be as generic as possible for all Brands, however need for today is specially for Brother Printers &amp; MFPs.</p>

<p>Sorry for looking nube but i have searched enough and there is not much information available.</p>

<p>Can i use native support &amp; Monitoring tool of the Manufacturer as brother provides its monitoring utility which can be installed on Desktop(In that case where the MIB file will be located(on the device or within installed program on the Desktop?) or need to use network monitoring tools like icanga, negios etc.</p>

<p>Secondly how to implement it on AIR.I am thinking to use AIR for the first time and wondering will it be helpful and do i need to know something more on this technology before proceeding.</p>

<p>There are some networking monitoring tools available like negios &amp; Icinga. which can be installed even over a desktop. Can the data from these can be parsed and used. We need it for brother printer but want to implement it for Multi-Manufacturer solution as per documents format for MIB file is getting standard. We will invest time only if its universal even after a year or so as its not  worth time for a single manufacturer.
So following CLI's i find useful in Net-SNMP and believe that it will get me to output by calling these Applictions by External Script(AIR).
convert between numerical and textual forms of MIB OIDs, and display MIB content and structure (snmptranslate).
A graphical MIB browser (tkmib), using Tk/perl.
A daemon application for receiving SNMP notifications (snmptrapd). Selected notifications can be logged (to syslog, the NT Event Log, or a plain text file), forwarded to another SNMP management system, or passed to an external application.
An extensible agent for responding to SNMP queries for management information (snmpd). This includes built-in support for a wide range of MIB information modules, and can be extended using dynamically loaded modules, external scripts and commands, and both the SNMP multiplexing (SMUX) and Agent Extensibility (AgentX) protocols.</p>

<p>Are there any API to read MIB files in AIR. </p>

Now an employee can have multiple wages as they can be working in different projects and I want the sum of his wages.There is also a column called <code>Employee_benefits_Claimed_Ind</code>. This is an indicator that indicates if the employee claimed any benefits in each project. He can claim benefits for some projects and not claim for some but as far as I am concerned if he claims benefits on even one project he does not qualify. Here is the table I am trying to populate:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE_QUAL
(Employee_id NUMBER,
 TOTAL_WAGES NUMBER,
EMPLOYEE_disQUALIFY CHAR(1))


INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE_QUAL(Employee_id, Total_wages, EMployee_disQualify)
SELECT      c_Employee_id,
            c_Total_wages,
            c_Employee_disQualify

            ) w on e.employee_id = w.employee_id
</code></pre>

<p>However if an employee claims benefits for one and does not for another this will just have two entries because of the <code>GROUP BY</code>. Ideally it should only be one entry with the Employee_disqualify_ind as 'Y' since he claimed benefits on one project. It does not matter if he did not on the other one. How do I go about achieving this?</p>

<p>If this is expected - should I use custom getters with member variables which I manually populate and return if present? Or there is something more clever? :)</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
As from DeBuGGeR's answer - I understand I can use <code>includes</code> when making a query in order to eager load everything, but I simply don't need it, and I can't do it all the time. It's waste of resources and a big overhead if I load my entire DB at the beginning, just to understand (by some criteria) that I won't need it. I want to make additional queries depending on situation. But I also can't afford to destroy all models (DAO objects) that I have and create new ones, with all the info inside them. I should be able to update parts of them, which are missing (from relations).</p>

<p>I know I can make the template such that these custom functions are defined locally at the point where these expressions are written out so that they get called when these expressions get evaluated at runtime.

<p>Ugh, not enough rep points to embed images. Sorry for the inconvenience. Plot is here: <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/am0Ud.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.stack.imgur.com/am0Ud.png</a></p>

<p>I played around with arrange() and after checking the data frame itself, I thought the following sorting should do the trick. (Note: blpos means ""bar label position"" and are the positions of the various numbers in the plot.) But plotting this ""sorted"" data frame leads to the identical plot as above. I do not understand which information to change to change the plotting order of the ItemQ column.</p>

<pre><code>q1m.bl.s &lt;- arrange(q1m.bl, ItemA, desc(blpos))
ggplot(q1m.bl.s, ....
</code></pre>

<p>What's the best approach anyway? Should I <em>manipulate the df</em> (using ddply/arrange/reorder/etc.) prior to plotting? Because I tend to think this is a presentation issue and should be done <em>inside</em> ggplot. Does it even matter? The ""ggplot ordered barchart"" questions I found on SO seem to use both approaches; yet none I found was referring to stacked bar <em>segments</em> and using factor data... hence this new question.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for enlightening me!</p>

Simply this is a vote counter - there are five buttons you can press, some of them will change first counter, others - second counter. Now what I want to do is to add a delay (like 3000 ms) before the function can be called again, so if the person starts smashing all the buttons rapidly, he won't spoil the results.

<p>In MOST cases installation makes no problems, even if we distribute none of both versions. But in a number of cases our installation just does not start.

In most cases again this problem can be resolved, by installing the .NET framework (although we do not use this). But now we have a case where this does not help.</p>

<p>I know that a solution would be, to install both versions as a shared assembly, but that seems not to be easy, and besides that i would prefer a much simpler solution. Does anybody know a workaround?</p>

In SQL Server 2000, if you didn't prefix your object names with a owner/schema (e.g. <code>SELECT * FROM blah</code> rather than <code>dbo.blah</code>) SQL Server would still figure it out. This worked even if your object was in a non-dbo owner.</p>

<p>In SQL Server 2005 this was changed as described here: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mssqlisv/archive/2007/03/23/upgrading-to-sql-server-2005-and-default-schema-setting.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mssqlisv/archive/2007/03/23/upgrading-to-sql-server-2005-and-default-schema-setting.aspx</a>. </p>

<p>I can get around a database having 2 schemas by making a user's default schema xyz instead of dbo. The problem I run into is in a database where there is a 3rd schema (abc.blah). When I make the users default xyz, they can get to dbo without a hitch but get an Invalid Object error when trying to select something from abc without a schema prefix (abc.blah works fine).</p>

<p>Of course, it shouldn't have been coded this way to begin with but that is a different battle. I've verified that permissions are not an issue.</p>

<p>I'm sure others have run into this. Has anyone found a workaround other than fixing the code?</p>

<p>It appears to work fine in Chrome and IE9, but IE8 is a different experience. We have a tab component for which css3pie styling is applied and when moving one tab to another tab, we are getting a flashing/jerk and content layout moving up and down. It also appears CSSPIE does not execute until after the browser “load” event has completed, which is why we are getting the “flashing” as the backgrounds get “loaded”, then CSSPIE executes and applies the formatting (only an issue in IE8). </p>

<p>So i have the two table and i want to merge them. i tried in phpmyadmin these two options:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT IGNORE INTO tableone SELECT * FROM tabletwo;
REPLACE INTO tableone SELECT * FROM tabletwo;
</code></pre>

<p>But both do the same(put one table on another). But i want to merge them. So what query must i use? I hope you understand the the question...</p>

Has anyone come up with any other solutions other than setting hidden ""currentOpenControl"" flag(s). If you are wondering as to do I need to check whether control is open for first time or re-open again, then one of the big reasons is databinding. When the control is open for first time, that is when I want to databind, afterwards on re-open, if I databind again I will lose any changes user might have added.
  So I am just wondering if anyone has a more elegant solution than setting flags whether control is open or not.</p>

<p>i could do something like this: </p>

<p><code>//emailAddress/value | //emailAddress/typeSource | ..</code>  but doing that will list all elements values together if im not mistaken leaving me to work out when i have finished reading from a specific emailAddress tag and going to the next emailAddress tag.</p>

<p>well to sum up my needs i basically want this to be returned similar to how you would return results from a bog standard sql query that returns results in a row. i.e. if your sql query produces 10 emailAddress, it will return each emailAddress in a row and i can simply iterate over ""each emailAddress"" and get the appropriate value based on the colunm name or index.</p>

<ol>
<li>How can I get a permalink from a post_type?</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see on this demo (the ""Our Works"" part), I would like to get the link of this post. So you would click on this image/post title and it would open the post page. Using the get_permalink() function nothing happens.</p>

<p>The function is this:</p>

<pre><code>function ccr_our_works() {

$labels = array(
    'name'                =&gt; __( 'Our works', 'codexcoder' ),

For some reason when I hover over it, it fills in the whole table instead of just the button. I want it to start from the beginning of the button to the end, not from the beginning of the table to the end.

<p>As one could expect, I encountered some issues.</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

}
var pageViewController:UIPageViewController!
var pageTitles:Array&lt;String&gt;!
var pageImages:Array&lt;String&gt;!
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.

    self.pageTitles = [""Over 200 Tips and Tricks"", ""Discover Hidden Features"", ""Bookmark Favorite Tip"", ""Free Regular Update""]
    self.pageImages = [""page1.png"", ""page2.png"", ""page3.png"", ""page4.png""]



    // Create page view controller

    self.pageViewController = self.storyboard!.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier(""PageViewController"") as! UIPageViewController
    self.pageViewController.dataSource = self
    var startingViewController:PageContentViewController  = self.viewControllerAtIndex(0)!
    var viewControllers:Array&lt;PageContentViewController&gt; = [startingViewController]
    self.pageViewController.setViewControllers(viewControllers, direction: UIPageViewControllerNavigationDirection.Forward, animated: false, completion: nil)

    self.pageViewController.view.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height - 30)
    self.addChildViewController(pageViewController)
    self.view.addSubview(pageViewController.view)
    self.pageViewController.didMoveToParentViewController(self)


}

override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {

    // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
}


func presentationCountForPageViewController(pageViewController: UIPageViewController) -&gt; Int {
    return self.pageTitles.count

    return 0
}

        return nil
    }

    var pageContentViewController: PageContentViewController = self.storyboard!.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier(""PageContentViewController"") as! PageContentViewController
    pageContentViewController.imageFile = self.pageImages[index]
    pageContentViewController.titleText = self.pageTitles[index]
    pageContentViewController.pageIndex = index

    return pageContentViewController

}


func pageViewController(pageViewController: UIPageViewController, viewControllerBeforeViewController viewController: UIViewController) -&gt; UIViewController?{

    var index: Int? = PageContentViewController().pageIndex!
    if ((index! == 0) || index! == NSNotFound)
    {
        return nil
    }
    else {
        index! = index! - 1
        println(index!)

    }
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the issues:</p>

<p>1) When I run the app, it loads the first picture, but swiping right leads to runtime error which suggests that index of page is equal to nil. Then I tried to initialize index inside PageContentViewController</p>

<pre><code>var pageIndex:Int! = 0
</code></pre>

<p>but this does not work. Index is not nil anymore, but whole logic of swiping right and left is down. It's counting only from 0 to 1 then gets back to 0 instead of incrementing to 2.</p>

<p>2) Second thing is that my label and button aren't visible, seems like they are covered by the picture, don't know why</p>

<p>If anybody got any idea about this index issue, I would be very grateful</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Additional thoughts:</p>

<p>The reason why I didn't think that having seperate tables for each ID's ideal for my application is that by using a key <code>id_type</code> I still wouldn't know which corresponding table to access through a <code>sql</code> statement without using <code>php</code></p>

<pre><code>void bar()
{
}

void foo()
{
    bar();
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, in C++, there are several types of functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Free functions</li>
<li>Private member functions</li>
<li>Public member functions</li>
<li>Static member functions</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm currently making my function order dependent on how they are ordered in the .hpp file, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo_bar {
public:
    Foo_bar();
    void foo();
private:
    int some_member;
    void bar();
</code></pre>

<p>But now, if the constructor uses foo() or bar(), these will be <em>below</em> the constructor in the source file, inconsistent with my usual ordering. I could of course reorder my header to take account of that:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo_bar {
private:
    int some_member;
    void bar();

public:
    void foo();
    Foo_bar();
</code></pre>

<p>But I think that's a mess.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in Java, the opposite to my first example seems to be common:</p>

<pre><code>void foo()
{
    bar();
}

void bar()
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's probably due to the top-down thinking common in OOP, in contrast to the bottom-up thinking common in procedural/functional programming. However, with free functions that don't have prototypes, this top-down style is not possible.</p>

<p>Is it even possible to order functions in C++ in a consistent way?</p>

I am already exploring the possibility of using <code>libtiff</code> in another <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17169300/how-to-make-libtiff-for-an-xcode-project-and-an-ios-application"">question</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>I have been sieving stack overflow for weeks and found working solutions for every one of my problems on its own. I have 4 things that need to work:</p>

<ol>
<li>I need the RGBA data as it comes from the camera, no compression whatsoever</li>
<li>I need as much metadata as possible, especially EXIF</li>
<li>I need to save in TIFF format for compatibility with other software and losslessness</li>
<li>I need protection from casual viewing by saving in a file, not the photo library</li>
</ol>

<p>I can have 2 and 4 by using JPEG.
I can have 1, 3 and 4 with raw data (respectively NSData) made from the camera buffer.
Can I have all 4 of my prerequisites with Xcode and iOS? I am about to give up and looking for your input as a last resort.</p>

<p>While still exploring this, I am also stuck on the other avenue I tried, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17169300/how-to-make-libtiff-for-an-xcode-project-and-an-ios-application"">libtiff</a>. I am still trying, though...</p>

<p>Here is the list of great advice I have tried, my own code is just put together from stack overflow sources like these:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9006759/how-to-write-exif-metadata-to-an-image-not-the-camera-roll-just-a-uiimage-or-j?lq=1"">How to write exif metadata to an image (not the camera roll, just a UIImage or JPEG)</a> (makes me wish I could use JPEG format, it is so effortless when doing what Apple prefers)</li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11612647/raw-image-data-from-camera-like-645-pro"">Raw image data from camera like “645 PRO”</a> (this would be the point to use e.g. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17169300/how-to-make-libtiff-for-an-xcode-project-and-an-ios-application"">libtiff</a>)</li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1320988/saving-cgimageref-to-a-png-file"">Saving CGImageRef to a png file?</a> (works with <code>kUTTypeTIFF</code>, too, but no metadata)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>The complete sequence of actions from <code>captureStillImageAsynchronouslyFromConnection</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[[self myAVCaptureStillImageOutput] captureStillImageAsynchronouslyFromConnection:videoConnection completionHandler: ^(CMSampleBufferRef imageSampleBuffer, NSError *error)
 {
     //get all the metadata in the image
     CFDictionaryRef metadata = CMCopyDictionaryOfAttachments(kCFAllocatorDefault, imageSampleBuffer, kCMAttachmentMode_ShouldPropagate);
     // get image reference
     CVImageBufferRef imageBuffer = CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer(imageSampleBuffer);
     // &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lock buffer address
     CVPixelBufferLockBaseAddress(imageBuffer, 0);

     //Get information about the image
     uint8_t *baseAddress = (uint8_t *)CVPixelBufferGetBaseAddress(imageBuffer);
     size_t bytesPerRow = CVPixelBufferGetBytesPerRow(imageBuffer);
     size_t width = CVPixelBufferGetWidth(imageBuffer);
     size_t height = CVPixelBufferGetHeight(imageBuffer);

     // create suitable color space
     CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB();

     //Create suitable context (suitable for camera output setting kCVPixelFormatType_32BGRA)
     CGContextRef newContext = CGBitmapContextCreate(baseAddress, width, height, 8, bytesPerRow, colorSpace, kCGBitmapByteOrder32Little | kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedFirst);

     // &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; unlock buffer address
     CVPixelBufferUnlockBaseAddress(imageBuffer, 0);

     // release color space
     CGColorSpaceRelease(colorSpace);

     //Create a CGImageRef from the CVImageBufferRef
     CGImageRef newImage = CGBitmapContextCreateImage(newContext);

     // release context
     CGContextRelease(newContext);

     // create destination and write image with metadata
     CFURLRef url = (__bridge CFURLRef)[NSURL fileURLWithPath:filePath isDirectory:NO];
     CGImageDestinationRef destination = CGImageDestinationCreateWithURL(url, kUTTypeTIFF, 1, NULL);
     CGImageDestinationAddImage(destination, imageRef, metadata);

     // finalize and release destination
     CGImageDestinationFinalize(destination);
     CFRelease(destination);
 }
</code></pre>

<p>The still image output related camera settings were:</p>

<pre><code>[[self myAVCaptureSession] setSessionPreset:AVCaptureSessionPresetPhoto];
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary *outputSettings = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:[NSNumber numberWithUnsignedInt:kCVPixelFormatType_32BGRA], (id)kCVPixelBufferPixelFormatTypeKey, nil];
[myAVCaptureStillImageOutput setOutputSettings:outputSettings];
</code></pre>

<p>I get a nice nominally uncompressed image in nominal TIFF format with all metadata. (It is mirrored on other systems, but now I can write the EXIF and other metadata, I can also fine-tune that, I am sure).</p>

<p>In my application, my main window is MiniDeviceConfig.xaml (as seen above).  In my Button.xaml file, I clearly set the button height to some obscene number.  And, this size is reflected in my main window's buttons.  However, some action on the main window triggers a modal window that has more buttons on it.  I was expecting the same tall buttons but no such luck.  How do I get the style to propagate into all windows in the application?</p>

<p>The problem is with authentication. The file is being saved but when I open it in Excel it's just the html logon page instead of the actual file. If I copy direct file url and paste it into browser addressbar and I'm not logged in to the webpage the effect is the same. I'm presented with the logon page. Then if I enter my login and password the download window will show up allowing me to save the file.</p>

<p>So I think that SetCredentials part of the code is not working properly cause if I debug.print WHTTP.ResponseBody it's html code instead of the acutal file data.</p>

<p>Is there a way to pass userid and password to the WinHTTP so I could be able to properly save the file?</p>

<p>=======================EDIT:========================</p>

<p>So I've played a little bit with it today and I think I'm moving forward. Here's what I got. I Modyfied the code like this:</p>

<pre><code>Sub SaveFileFromURL()

Dim FileNum As Long
Dim FileData() As Byte
Dim WHTTP As Object

fileUrl = ""https://www.website.com/dir1/dir2/file.xls""
filePath = ""C:\myfile.xls""

myuser = ""username""
mypass = ""password""

strAuthenticate = ""start-url=%2F&amp;user="" &amp; myuser &amp; ""&amp;password="" &amp; mypass &amp; ""&amp;switch=Log+In""

Set WHTTP = CreateObject(""WinHTTP.WinHTTPrequest.5.1"")

WHTTP.Open ""POST"", fileUrl, False
WHTTP.SetRequestHeader ""Content-Type"", ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded""
WHTTP.Send strAuthenticate

WHTTP.Open ""GET"", fileUrl, False
WHTTP.Send

Debug.Print WHTTP.GetAllResponseHeaders()

FileData = WHTTP.ResponseBody
Set WHTTP = Nothing

FileNum = FreeFile
Open filePath For Binary Access Write As #FileNum
    Put #FileNum, 1, FileData
Close #FileNum

MsgBox ""File has been saved!"", vbInformation, ""Success""

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>When I Debug.Print WHTTP.GetAllResponseHeaders() I get e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Disposition: attachement; filename=""xxx""
Content-Length: xxxxxx
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
</code></pre>

<p>So I think that authentication worked but I still cannot save the file. When I continue with:</p>

<pre><code>FileData = WHTTP.ResponseBody
Set WHTTP = Nothing

FileNum = FreeFile
Open filePath For Binary Access Write As #FileNum
    Put #FileNum, 1, FileData
Close #FileNum
</code></pre>

<p>The content of the saved file is the html webpage itself, but not the file.</p>

<p>Did I do the authentication rigth and the problem is with saving the file to the disk or still is there a problem with authentication and that's why I cannot save it? Any clues?</p>

How best to debug this?</p>

"24286794","1","","","2014-06-18 13:25:02","","0","28","<p>One aspect of my project involves comparing the part number entered by the operator to a predetermined list of part numbers in a column in a database.  Right now, my program is telling me that every part number entered in the spreadsheet (50+) does not match any in the database, which I've verified to be incorrect.  I've checked that both the spreadsheet part number and the database part number are of string datatype.  I've doublechecked that my looping logic is good, and to me seems like it should work.  To the best of my knowledge there are no hidden characters in either the database cells or in the spreadsheet cells.  I'm completely stumped at this point as to why my program doesn't detect any matches between the spreadsheet and the database.  Below is the Sub containing the code for checking that the part numbers match:</p>

<pre><code>Sub CheckPN()
  'Connect to the E2 database
   Call SetPNConnection
  'Open a recordset
   Set PNRecordset = New ADODB.Recordset
   PNRecordset.Open ""EstimRpt"", PNConnection, adOpenKeyset, adLockOptimistic, adCmdTable
   PNSQLCmd = ""SELECT DISTINCT [PartNo] FROM EstimRpt;""
  'Loop through data, comparing part numbers to E2 database part number records
   TotalBadPNCount = 0
   With PNRecordset
      For DataRowCount = 2 To TrackingLastRow
         PNCount = 0
         Part_Number = Tracking.Sheets(""Operator Data"").Range(""A"" &amp; DataRowCount).Value
        'MsgBox ""The datatype for "" &amp; Part_Number &amp; "" is "" &amp; VarType(Part_Number) &amp; "".""
         Do Until .EOF
           'MsgBox ""The datatype for "" &amp; .Fields(""PartNo"").Value &amp; "" is "" &amp; VarType(.Fields(""PartNo"").Value) &amp; "".""
            If Part_Number = .Fields(""PartNo"").Value Then
           'If .Fields(""PartNo"").Value = Part_Number Then
               MsgBox Part_Number &amp; "" is a match.""
               PNCount = PNCount + 1
            End If
            .MoveNext
         Loop
         If PNCount &lt; 1 Then
            MsgBox ""The P/N "" &amp; Part_Number &amp; "" entered in cell A"" &amp; DataRowCount &amp; "" is incorrect.  Please correctly enter the P/N and re-run the program.""
            TotalBadPNCount = TotalBadPNCount + 1
         End If
      Next DataRowCount
      If TotalBadPNCount &gt;= 1 Then
         Exit Sub
      End If
   End With
   PNRecordset.Close
   Set PNRecordset = Nothing
   PNConnection.Close
   Set PNConnection = Nothing
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>On a side note, I'd like to have the entire program stop executing if a part number doesn't match, not just the immediate sub.  Currently, just this sub exits upon no part number matches.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help on both of these issues.</p>

<pre>
 - src
   - java
     - common
       - net
       - database
     - team1
     - team2
     - team3
       - lib
 - tests
   - java
     - common
       - net
       - database
     - team1
     - team2
     - team3
       - lib
</pre>

<p>The goal is to have a build system where team[1-3] can have independent builds that explicitly specify their dependencies.  Dependencies might look like:</p>

<pre>
 - team1
   - common/net
   - team3/lib
 - team2
   - common/database
 - team3
</pre>

<p>So, for example, the build for team1 would include everything within the team1, common/net, and team3/lib; but nothing else.  Ideally, tests would be integrated in the same fashion (testing team1 would run tests for team1, common/net, and team3/lib).</p>

<p>I'm currently using Ant, but haven't found a sane way to manage a hierarchy like this.  I started to look at Maven 2 for its ability to manage a dependency hierarchy, but it seems to want full-fledged projects for each module.  That wouldn't be a problem, but it seems to force me into a directory structure that does not map well to the traditional java package hierarchy.  It seems like I might be able to do what I want with buildr using an <a href=""http://buildr.apache.org/extending.html#layouts"" rel=""nofollow"">alternative layout</a>, but I'm worried that might prove to be brittle.</p>

<p>Can someone recommend something that might work for me?</p>

<p>Now when I download, I download the file by 1024 bytes burst, and everytime it downloads 1kb I  concat the temp array to the main data array.tH</p>

<p>I use this concat method:</p>

<pre><code>public static byte[] concat(byte[] data, byte[] bytes) {
     byte[] result = Arrays.copyOf(data, data.length + bytes.length);
     System.arraycopy(bytes, 0, result, data.length, bytes.length);
     return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is my download process:</p>

<pre><code>    URL target = new URL (""http://freshhdwall.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Image-Art-Gallery.jpg"");
    URLConnection t = target.openConnection();
    t.setRequestProperty(""User-Agent"", ""NING/1.0"");
    t.connect();

    BufferedInputStream stream = new BufferedInputStream(t.getInputStream());

    final byte[] bytes = new byte[1024];
    int count;

    byte[] data = new byte[0];

    while ( (count = stream.read(bytes, 0, bytes.length)) != -1) {
        System.out.println(count);
        data = concat(data, bytes);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now after downloading, I convert the bytes array to <code>BufferedImage</code> using <code>ByteArrayInputStream</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    InputStream s = new ByteArrayInputStream(data);
    BufferedImage m = ImageIO.read(s);
</code></pre>

<p>And then I display the result:</p>

<pre><code>    JFrame j = new JFrame();
    j.add(new JLabel(new ImageIcon(m)));
    j.pack();
    j.setVisible(true);
</code></pre>

<p>Now the result image looks like this:</p>

"19728861","1","","","2013-11-01 14:33:52","","0","115","<p>I am working on an asp.net mvc web application, currently I am having some issues when dealing with strings, basically because of :-</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Insert or edit values with white spaces in the begging and end.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the string uniqueness , when editing a  field.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For the first issue I have the following action method:-</p>

<pre><code>[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public ActionResult Create(DataCenter dc)
{ 
</code></pre>

<p>Where data center has a property named “Name”. Now if users insert values such as “ABC” and “ ABC  ”, they will be saved on the SQL server as two different values. Although I have defined a unique constrain on the database. So the best way I found to solve this is to modify my action method to be as follows:</p>

<pre><code>[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public ActionResult Create(DataCenter dc)
{
    dc.name = dc.name.trim();
    //…
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I ended up doing so on all the associated action methods and on the edit &amp; create action methods.</p>

<p><em>Question 1: Is there a better way to trim strings?</em></p>

<p>Second issue, on the action method I was checking is the string is unique or not as follows, by writing a service method:-</p>

<pre><code>if (!repository.IsDataCenterUnique(dc.Name))
{
    ModelState.AddModelError(""Name"", ""Error occurred: DataCenter Name already exsists."");
}
</code></pre>

<p>But having this method inside an edit action method will cause an error in case the user edits the object but did not change its name. So I modified my service method to pass the object id, then I was excluding it from the comparison as follows:-</p>

<pre><code>if (!repository.IsDataCenterUnique(dc.Name,dc.ID))
{
    ModelState.AddModelError(""Name"", ""Error occurred: DataCenter Name already exsists."");
}

public bool IsDataCenterUnique(string name,int? id=0)
{
    return !tms.DataCenters.Any(a =&gt; a.Name.ToUpper() == name.ToUpper() &amp;&amp; a.ID != id);
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Question 2: Is there a better way to solve this issue instead of passing the object id and excluding it?</em></p>

<p>A very basic http request:</p>

<pre><code>GET http://stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag?tagnames=c%23&amp;sort=newest HTTP/1.1
Host: stackoverflow.com
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
</code></pre>

<p>which hits a route decorated with:</p>

<pre><code>[OutputCache(Duration = 300, VaryByParam = ""tagnames;sort"",
    VaryByContentEncoding = ""gzip;deflate"", VaryByCustom = ""site"")]
</code></pre>

<p>is repeatedly <strong><em>and incorrectly</em></strong> serving either a 304 (no change) if you include if-modified-since, or <em>the old data</em> for a 200, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: public, max-age=0
Content-Type: application/atom+xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Encoding: gzip
Expires: Fri, 01 Jul 2011 09:17:08 GMT
Last-Modified: Fri, 01 Jul 2011 09:12:08 GMT
Vary: *
Date: Fri, 01 Jul 2011 09:42:46 GMT
Content-Length: 14714
(payload, when decoded = some long-stale data)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it is serving this nearly half an hour <em>past</em> the 5 minute slot; it looks like the internals of OutputCache simply didn't notice the time ;p It will expire <em>eventually</em> (in fact, it has just done so - my <code>Fri, 01 Jul 2011 09:56:20 GMT</code> request finally got fresh data), but not anywhere like punctually.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I <em>believed</em> that it was working if we took away the accept-encoding header, but no; this fails too - it just fails on a different cycle (which is what we should expect since the keys are different, courtesy of <code>VaryByContentEncoding</code>):</p>

<pre><code>GET http://stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag?tagnames=c%23&amp;sort=newest HTTP/1.1
Host: stackoverflow.com
</code></pre>

<p>gives:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: public, max-age=0
Content-Type: application/atom+xml; charset=utf-8
Expires: Fri, 01 Jul 2011 10:09:58 GMT

Vary: *
Date: Fri, 01 Jul 2011 10:17:20 GMT
Content-Length: 66815
(payload = some stale data)
</code></pre>

<p>Once again, you'll notice it is being served <em>after</em> <code>Expires</code>.</p>

<p>So: what could be wrong here?</p>

<p>Additional; while we are using a custom option, our <code>GetVaryByCustomString()</code> correctly calls <code>base.GetVaryByCustomString(ctx, custom)</code> for options it doesn't recognise, as per <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5ecf4420.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN</a> (indeed this works fine for the second example above).</p>

<p>When user finishes editing, the datagridview should refresh and display only those records which satisfy the gird's dataview criteria. so at the end of EndEdit i call doubleClick event of a control which populates the grid again according to the criteria. this approach works fine as long as the edit is complete. but if the user is still in edit mode &amp; any other cell of the <strong>same</strong> datagridview is clicked i get this exception.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>every other control is good because grid is out of edit mode. I have tried:</p>

<p>before assigning the datasource to the grid again, but it gives the same exception.</p>

<p>My company uses a centralized user registration web-service for our various properties. We generally send a request to the web service via HttpURLConnection with request-method GET, setting parameters via qs. This has worked fine in the past.</p>

<p>For another property with which we've recently acquired and plugged into our registration web service, HttpURLConnection seems to be duplicating parameters when sent along. The expected value of a parameter is <code>paramName=value</code>, but we're receiving <code>paramName=value, value</code> instead. Here's a representation of what it looks like in our logs:</p>

<p><em>Note: Removing information specific to my employer and our systems.</em></p>

<pre><code>01-26 15:21:54 [TP-Processor17] INFO  com].[/] - parameter=userName=nameValue65, nameValue65
01-26 15:21:54 [TP-Processor17] INFO  com].[/] - parameter=policyAccepted=true, true
</code></pre>

<p>This, of course, caused the end-point validation to error and disable user-registration.</p>

<p>Here's a representation of the code used to create the connection:</p>

<pre><code>URL url = new URL(""http://account-ws.domain.tld/register.action?responseType=json&amp;userName=nameValue65&amp;age=24&amp;country=US&amp;password1=Passw3rt&amp;emailAddress=name@domain.tld&amp;tosAccepted=true&amp;policyAccepted=true"");

HttpURLConnection urlc = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
urlc.setRequestMethod(""GET"");
urlc.setDoOutput(true);
urlc.setAllowUserInteraction(false);

PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(urlc.getOutputStream());
ps.print(restEndPoint);
ps.close();
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps(?) useful info:</p>

<ul>
<li>The registration form submits to itself using POST, at which point we validate using Struts forms, and send the request to the web service using the values returned by the Struts form validation class. (These values are checked for accuracy once more before sending.)</li>
<li>Wireshark and log4j debug messages indicate that the URL sent to the web service is correct / what we would expect, with single values for each parameter.</li>
<li>The initiating form's post fields are named identically to the query keys sent with the web service request.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please ask for more info if you find what's here to be insufficient.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance! :)</p>

<pre><code>(CASE WHEN EXISTS(SELECT * FROM INSERTED I WHERE I.ID = R.ID)
THEN '1' ELSE '0' END) AS IsUpdated -- Is selected row just added?
</code></pre>

<p>as well as JOINs etc. I like to have the result as a single table with all included.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong>. Can I move this SELECT to SQL Server side? If yes, how to do this?</p>

<p>Saying ""move"", I mean to create a stored procedure or something else that can be executed before reading dataset in while cycle.</p>

<p>The 2 following questions make sense only if answer is ""yes"".</p>

<p>Why do I want to move SELECT? First off, I don't like mixing SQL with C# code. At second, I suppose that server-side queries run faster, since the server have more chances to cache them.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2</strong>. Am I right? Is it some sort of optimizing?</p>

<p>Also, the SELECT contains constant strings, but they are localizable. For instance,</p>

<pre><code>WHERE R.Status = ""Enabled""
</code></pre>

<p>""Enabled"" should be changed for French, German etc. So, I want to write 2 static methods -- OnCreate and OnDestroy -- then mark them as stored procedures. When registering/unregistering my assembly on server side, just call them respectively. In OnCreate format the SELECT string, replacing {0}, {1}... with required values from the assembly resources. Then I can localize resources only, not every script.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3</strong>. Is it good idea? Is there an existing attribute to mark methods to be executed by SQL Server automatically after (un)registartion an assembly?</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<ul>
<li>Applying the same validation logic on both sides (server and client) without writing client-specific code (except for the module, of course)</li>
<li>Error messages used by the JS module have to come from the server, so that I can have translated error message ""for free""</li>
<li>Developers should be able to reuse this feature with as less steps as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>The (server side) framework that I must use is Zend (vs 1.11.3).</p>

<p>My solution is the following one and I'd like to read your comments and feedback:</p>

<ul>
<li>I implemented a Zend Decorator that parses all zend form element validators and it adds to each form element a json containing all zend form validators information (messages templates, variables...).</li>
<li>Then I implemented a JS Module (it wraps jQuery validation plugin) that parses that form element attribute and maps all server side validators into client side validators using settings (messages and variables) that are contained in the json.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point what I have is what I needed to have:
- There is the same logic on both sides
- I use the error messages that are provided by the server
- A developer can reuse it, adding a Zend Decorator to the form or to the form element and including the js module into the view.</p>

<p>It seems to be the right solution to my problem. Does it seem a good solution also for you?</p>

All of my other questions have been answered by Google so far, but there are still two that I have not found answers for.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: I am going to be doing a bit of file I/O and web-page getting/processing within my threads. Is there anyway to guarantee what the threads do to be atomic? I am going to be letting my program run for quite a while, more than likely, and it won't really have a predetermined ending point. I am going to be catching the signal from a ctrl+c and I want to do some cleanup afterwards and still want my program to print out results/close files, etc.</p>

<p>I'm just wondering if it is reasonable behavior for the program to wait for the threads to complete or if I should just kill all the threads/close the file and exit. I just don't want my results to be skewed. Should I/can I just do a pthread_exit() in the signal catching method?</p>

<p>Any other comments/ideas on this would be nice.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: Valgrind is saying that I have some possible memory leaks. Are these avoidable, or does this always happen with threading in c++? Below are two of the six or so messages that I get when checking with valgrind. </p>

<p>I have been looking at a number of different websites, and one said that some possible memory leaks could be because of sleeping a thread. This doesn't make sense to me, nevertheless, I am currently sleeping the threads to test the setup I have right now (I'm not actually doing any real I/O at the moment, just playing with threads).</p>

The application I've deployed also has a background process that can be turned on. The app tends to take up close to all of the 512MBs allocated by Heroku for a single dyno - without the background process running. Everything seems to work fine without the background process turned on, however when I turn on the background process my application starts using more memory than the 512MB allocated and I'm immediately hit with NoSuchMethodErrors. I've included the stack trace below. It seems odd to me that a NoSuchMethodError is thrown due to lack of memory but it is the only variable I can think of. The program works perfectly fine until I turn on the background process.</p>

<p>What's really strange is that all endpoints will serve JSON with no problem for a short while once I restart the application - but then after a variable amount of time the same endpoints will start throwing NoSuchMethodErrors.

<p>Basically I will have a header, which will be 50px heigh, and the relative div below there. Below that div, theres another div that HAS to be 50px inside the screen (Without scrolling). More content of that div, or another div (I dont mind which one) will be outside the screen.</p>

<p>So if the browser is 1000px heigh, 100px will be spend for the top and bottom divs. That means the relative div must be 900px heigh.</p>

Thus the <code>explicit_set_styles</code> function was born. Yet the problem is I am still creating a repaint by appending a child element. This is how it works</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the computed style of  element we want to get declared css properties</li>
<li>Create the same type of element and get the ""defaults"" from that computed style</li>
<li>iterate over that and check for differences if there are some then most likely means it was a change in the CSS declaration.</li>
<li>Remove the type element for testing from the DOM </li>
</ol>

<p>So by appending a new DOM element we repaint the DOM, but that is the only way we can test for defaults because by not appending it all the computed styles are blank 100%. So anyone have solutions to get the default values for comparison values?</p>

<pre><code>function explicit_set_styles(){
    var elm_defaultView = (this.ownerDocument || document).defaultView;
    var elm_computedStyles = elm_defaultView.getComputedStyle(this,null);
    var element_test = document.createElement(this.tagName.toLowerCase());
    document.body.appendChild(element_test);
    var et_df = (element_test.ownerDocument || document).defaultView;
    var et_cs = et_df.getComputedStyle(element_test,null);
    var set_styles = null;  

    for(var prop in elm_computedStyles) {
        if( prop !== ""cssText"" &amp;&amp; elm_computedStyles[prop] !== et_cs[prop] ) {
            if(set_styles === null) set_styles = {};
            set_styles[prop] = elm_computedStyles[prop];
          }
    }
    document.body.removeChild(element_test);
    return set_styles;
}

<p>So I was thinking of doing it two ways possibly? By creating an iframe and not appending it but rather appending the test element to that and getting it's defaults, though if I am correct wouldn't that still take up unnecessary CPU from the browser? I've tested this and my return value looks like so</p>

<pre><code>{
    alignSelf: ""stretch""
    height: ""32px""
    left: ""0px""
    perspectiveOrigin: ""411px 16px""
    position: ""absolute""
    right: ""0px""
    top: ""0px""
    transformOrigin: ""411px 16px""
    webkitLogicalHeight: ""32px""
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is what is actually declared by inline, embedded, and external CSS</p>

<pre><code>{
    height: 32px;
    width: 100%;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
}

<ol>
<li><p>I can POST to the server non-multipart requests, and I can capture the request and see:</p>

<pre><code>Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
</code></pre>

<p>and I also can see the characters encoded OK (á, é, í, ó, ú).</p></li>
<li><p>If I POST using AJAX + file upload + FormData, using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>var data = new FormData();
data.append('body', jq(""#sp_body"").val());
data.append('signature', jq(""#sp_signature"").val());
data.append('subject', jq(""#sp_subject"").val());
data.append('email', jq(""#sp_email"").val());
data.append(""file"", jq(""#sp_file"")[0].files[0]);
jq.ajax({
    url: contextPath + ""/jobs/"" + job + ""/sendmail"",
    data: data,
    cache: false,
    dataType: 'text',
    processData: false,
    contentType: false,
    mimeType: ""multipart/form-data"",
    type: 'POST',
    success: function(result){
        data = jq.parseJSON(result);
        if (data[""statusCode""] == ""success"") {
            jq(""#save_status"").html(""Email sent!"").show().delay(5000).fadeOut(200);
        } else {
            jq(""#save_status"").html(data[""errors""]).show().delay(5000).fadeOut(200);
        }
    },
    error: function (xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError) {
        alert(xhr.status);
        alert(thrownError);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Then I capture the request and I see:</p>

<pre><code>Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------279972256522979
</code></pre>

<p>But no UTF-8 in the header, and the non-latin characters are garbled.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The question is, how can I POST using FormData (since I want to POST strings and a file at the same time), having UTF-8 encoding set?</p>

<p>I've read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/546365/utf-8-text-is-garbled-when-form-is-posted-as-multipart-form-data"">UTF-8 text is garbled when form is posted as multipart/form-data</a> but that didn't help me.</p>

<pre><code>df2 =
             0          1          2           3           4
val_str      test       test       test        test       test
val_date     2014-01-15 2014-01-15 2014-01-15  2014-01-15 2014-01-15
val_float    1.5        1.5        1.5         1.5        1.5
val_int      1          1          1           1          1
</code></pre>

<p>as example generated by:</p>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import datetime
df = pd.DataFrame(index=range(5))
df['val_str'] = ""test""
df['val_date']= datetime.datetime(2014,1,15)
df['val_bool'] = True
df['val_float'] = 1.5
df['val_int'] = 1
df2=df.T
</code></pre>

<p>Convoluted example, but the data comes from excel, csv etc and the a lot of times the the rows have consistent datatypes instead of the columns.</p>

<p>Pandas seems to handle its methods (mostly) well with this kind of data, but I frequently get unexpected results when selecting or trying to do boolean operations with the data.</p>

<p>Selecting data with e.g.</p>

<pre><code>df2[2]['val_bool']  #eems to work without problem
</code></pre>

<p>seems to work well, even pulling rows out with e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>df2.ix['val_bool']  # works fine
</code></pre>

<p>seems to work as expected.   I frequently run into problems trying to use this slice to further select data.</p>

<pre><code>df2.ix['val_bool'].dtype
&gt;&gt;&gt; dtype('O')
# trying boolean operations on this gives numeric results?
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any pandas guideline as to whether this could cause problems.  I have gone back to some of the initial tutorials and gathered that columns ""should"" have consistent datatypes.  Pandas' flexibility however allows you to do this, but some of the methods break?   I vaguely remember one of Wes McKinneys talk where he mentioned that:</p>

<pre><code>df.T.T  != df
</code></pre>

<p>What are the differences and what should I be careful of when columns in DataFrame does not have consistent datatypes?</p>

<p>because the discussion goes wrong way - the model Human and model Person is surely good - in the admin everything works properly - but I create the interface for entering data (i don't want to select father/mother from other possibilities like in admin module)</p>

The very important modification:</p>

<pre><code>  father = models.ForeignKey('Human', related_name=""father"", null=True, blank=True)
  mother = models.ForeignKey('Human', related_name=""mother"", null=True, blank=True)

<li>Adding configurations (e.g. Customer 1 Test, Customer 1 Release). This approach somehow collides with the already existing configurations (Debug/Release), as I might want to debug the release version of an app.</li>
<li>Defining an environment variable used to conditionally include the right files in the .csproj file (e.g. <code>$(Customer)</code>). Requires developers to mess arround with such a variable, but quite easy to handle during build.</li>
<li>Using a symbolic link for the assets directory.</li>
<li>Adding a pre-build script that just overwrites the assets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a recommended way to implement such a scenario?</p>

Here is my view:</p>

            set

<p>So i think this is good, this works in usercontrols but now i am working in a window. If i set a breakpoint in the setters of Visibility, it works fine, but the textbox just does'nt become visible? Does somebody know what i am doing wrong?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The cause was "" The problem is the vssprovider.dll failed to load.""</p>

<p><strong>And the solution was</strong> </p>

<p>Remove vssprovider.dll from the list of packages to skip by running: </p>

<p><strong>devenv.exe /resetskippkgs</strong></p>

<p>I implemented this solution and it worked. </p>

<p><strong>But i have few questions here</strong></p>

<p>1) what is this command actually doing ? Is that the right way to to remove vssprovider.dll .</p>

<p>2) Will this afffect the devolopment in future and throw some unexpected error/behavour in IDE ?</p>

My code as of yet is:</p>

<pre><code>(defun collatz-steps (n)

</code></pre>

<p>The memoize function is the same as the one given in the <a href=""http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/onlisp.pdf"">On Lisp</a> book. </p>

<p>This code doesn't actually give any speedup compared to the non-memoized version. I believe it's due to the recursive calls calling the non-memoized version of the function, which sort of defeats the purpose. In that case, what is the correct way to do the memoization here? Is there any way to have all calls to the original function call the memoized version itself, removing the need for the special m-collatz-steps symbol?</p>

<p>EDIT: Corrected the code to have </p>

<pre><code>(defvar m-collatz-steps (memoize #'collatz-steps))
</code></pre>

<p>which is what I had in my code. 
Before the edit I had erroneously put:</p>

<pre><code>(defvar collatz-steps (memoize #'collatz-steps))
</code></pre>

<p>Seeing that error gave me another idea, and I tried using this last defvar itself and changing the recursive calls to </p>

<pre><code>       (1+ (funcall collatz-steps (/ n 2)))
       (1+ (funcall collatz-steps (1+ (* 3 n))))
</code></pre>

<p>This does seem to perform the memoization (speedup from about 60 seconds to 1.5 seconds), but requires changing the original function. Is there a cleaner solution which doesn't involve changing the original function? </p>

"15821387","1","","","2013-04-04 20:46:43","","4","5059","<p>In my VB6 application I make several calls to a COM server my team created from a Ada project (using GNATCOM). There are basically 2 methods available on the COM server. Their prototypes in VB are:</p>

<pre><code>Sub PutParam(Param As Parameter_Type, Value)
Function GetParam(Param As Parameter_Type)
</code></pre>

<p>where <strong>Parameter_Type</strong> is an enumerated type which distinguishes the many parameters I can put to/get from the COM server and 'Value' is a <strong>Variant</strong> type variable. PutParam() receives a variant and GetParam() returns a variant. (I don't really know why in the VB6 Object Browser there's no reference to the Variant type on the COM server interface...).</p>

<p>The product of this project has been used continuously this way for years without any problems in this interface on computers with Windows XP with SP2. On computers with WinXP SP3 we get the error 0x800706F7 ""The stub received bad data"" when trying to put parameters with the 'Long' type.</p>

<p>Does anybody have any clue on what could be causing this? The COM server is still being built in a system with SP2. Should make any difference building it on a system with SP3? (like when we build for X64 in X64 systems).</p>

<p>One of the calls that are causing the problem is the following (changed some var names): </p>

<pre class=""lang-vb prettyprint-override""><code>Dim StructData As StructData_Type

StructData.FirstLong = 1234567
StructData.SecondLong = 8901234
StructData.Status = True

ComServer.PutParam(StructDataParamType, StructData)
</code></pre>

<p>Where the definition of StructData_Type is:</p>

<pre class=""lang-vb prettyprint-override""><code>Type StructData_Type
    FirstLong As Long
    SecondLong As Long
    Status As Boolean
End Type
</code></pre>

<p>(the following has been added after the question was first posted)</p>

<p>The definition of the primitive calls on the interface of the COM server in IDL are presented below:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>// Service to receive data
HRESULT PutParam([in] Parameter_Type Param, [in] VARIANT *Value);

//Service to send requested data
HRESULT GetParam([in] Parameter_Type Param, [out, retval] VARIANT *Value);
</code></pre>

<p>The definition of the structure I'm trying to pass is:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>struct StructData_Type
{
   int FirstLong;
   int SecondLong;
   VARIANT_BOOL Status;
} StructData_Type;
</code></pre>

<p>I found it strange that this definition here is using 'int' as the type of FirstLong and SeconLong and when I check the VB6 object explorer they are typed 'Long'. Btw, when I do extract the IDL from the COM server (using a specific utility) those parameters are defined as Long.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I have tested the same code with a version of my COM server compiled for Windows 7 (different version of GNAT, same GNATCOM version) and it works! I don't really know what happened here.

<p>any ideas on how to go about it?</p>

<p>the liteal_eval does indeed work on the sample data I posted earlier. But it doesnt work for the above case.</p>

<p>The way I'm doing it now is : 
by replacing '),(' with ';'
and removing all brackets '(',')'
and then splitting by ';'</p>

<p>Is there a faster/better way?</p>

<p>My problem is, as (I'm sure) many have had before: I just want it to compile.</p>

<p>Question 3641178 seems to suggest that the order of the include files is important, but the headers that are giving errors come AFTER all other included files in vt.c.</p>

<p>I have tried installing Open Watcom on Linux, and the provided header files are the same. As far as I know, these are standard header files, and I can think of no reason why they should cause compile errors.</p>

<p>If anyone can shed any light on this, I'd be very grateful. The entire directory can be accessed in my git repo at git@github.com:megamasha/Vocab-Tester.git (<a href=""https://github.com/megamasha/Vocab-Tester"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/megamasha/Vocab-Tester</a>)</p>

<p>Should I create new View Model for this because I just need to use PhotoChooser task and the Camera Capture task here?</p>

<p>How do I bind Popup to my View Model.</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>@Charleh, Your Suggestion for using with windowmanager with a separate ViewModel worked, with a minor tweak.</p>

<p>I removed the <code>&lt;Popup&gt;</code> tag and used the window manager to display the popup.</p>

<p>But now I cannot close the popup and the popup is cropped as it's displayed at the top of the screen. How do I fix this?</p>

<p>Edit: I was able to close the dialog using the the Screen's <code>TryClose()</code> Method. </p>

<p>When I used the <code>ShowDialog</code> method instead the of the <code>ShowPopup</code>method and the alignment of the window was a bit better but it is still stuck at the top and wont align in the center.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/XJiMS.png"" alt=""Dialog Image""></p>

<p>Edit: I have created a new PhoneApplicationPage(Windows Phone 8 equivalent of window) and displayed it as a dialog. The problem with this approach is that the PhoneApplicationPage is not stretching automatically to fill the screen space(Which it does when not displayed as a dialog). It's just stretching to accommodate the content inside it. Setting `VerticalAlignment=""Stretch"" has no effect. </p>

<p>Giving the <code>Height</code> property a particular value is not suitable because of it does not adjust to well to different phone resolutions.</p>

<p>@Charleh I tried specifying height and width like this: </p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt; properies = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;();
properies.Add(""Height"", 768);
properies.Add(""Width"", 480);
windowManager.ShowDialog(new ImageSelectorPopupViewModel(),null,properies);
</code></pre>

<p>This Code has no effect (although specifying the height in Xaml works but I cannot use that as I have to accommodate for different screen resolutions on the phone)</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I have <code>default.profile.uml</code> and <code>LocalProfil.profile.uml</code> in the same folder than my <code>.uml</code> file.</p>

<p>I use this code to get my UML2 Model :</p>

<pre><code>URI typesUri = URI.createFileURI(path);
ResourceSet set = new ResourceSetImpl();
set.getPackageRegistry().put(UMLPackage.eNS_URI, UMLPackage.eINSTANCE);
set.getResourceFactoryRegistry().getExtensionToFactoryMap().put(UMLResource.FILE_EXTENSION, UMLResource.Factory.INSTANCE);
set.createResource(typesUri);
Map&lt;URI, URI&gt; uriMap = set.getURIConverter().getURIMap();
URI uri = URI.createURI(""jar:file:/C:/Users/ffischer/Desktop/org.eclipse.uml2.uml.resources_3.1.1.v201008191505.jar!/"");
uriMap.put(URI.createURI(UMLResource.LIBRARIES_PATHMAP), uri.appendSegment(""libraries"").appendSegment(""""));
uriMap.put(URI.createURI(UMLResource.METAMODELS_PATHMAP), uri.appendSegment(""metamodels"").appendSegment(""""));
uriMap.put(URI.createURI(UMLResource.PROFILES_PATHMAP), uri.appendSegment(""profiles"").appendSegment(""""));
Resource r = set.getResource(typesUri, true);

Model m = (Model) EcoreUtil.getObjectByType(r.getContents(), UMLPackage.Literals.MODEL);
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works fine, except that I can't get stereotypes associed with my classes.
(for exemple, this code send me empty arrays :)</p>

<pre><code>ClassImpl _c = (ClassImpl) el;
System.out.println(_c.getName() + "" stereotypes :"");
System.out.println(_c.getStereotypeApplications());
System.out.println(_c.getApplicableStereotypes());
System.out.println(_c.getAppliedStereotypes());
</code></pre>

<p>I think maybe I forget to do one step but I don't see which.</p>

<p>I hope someone can help me :)</p>

<ul>
<li>Pool</li>
<li>MDA</li>
<li>Other</li>
</ul>

<p>If the file is opened twice from MDA and once from Pool, I'll get two entries:</p>

<pre><code>TESTID        SITE       LATEST_READ READ_COUNT FILE_ORIGIN_ID
------------- ---------- ----------- ---------- --------------
File1        |Site1     |02/05/13   |         2|             1 
File1        |Site2     |22/01/14   |         3|             2 
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>What I want to achieve is to get the ratio of files that are not in the Pool OR the MDA grouped by sites. So I managed to do this resquest:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Count(TESTID) as OTHER_FILES, SITE, 'OTHERS'
FROM USER_STATS.FILE_USAGE_LOG
WHERE TESTID not in (
  -- Files that are on Pool OR MDA
  SELECT TESTID
  FROM USER_STATS.FILE_USAGE_LOG
  WHERE FILE_ORIGIN_ID &lt; 2
)
AND LATEST_READ between '01/05/2015' and '01/06/2015'
GROUP BY Site

UNION ALL
SELECT Count(TESTID) as OTHER_FILES, site, 'Files that are at least in Pool or MDA'
FROM USER_STATS.FILE_USAGE_LOG
WHERE TESTID in (
  -- Files that are on Pool OR MDA
  SELECT TESTID
  FROM USER_STATS.FILE_USAGE_LOG
  WHERE FILE_ORIGIN_ID &lt; 2
)
AND LATEST_READ between '01/05/2015' and '01/06/2015'
GROUP BY Site
</code></pre>

<p>Which gives me this:</p>

<pre><code>18      BR-CTA      Files that are at least in Pool or MDA
324     BR-CTA      OTHERS
26      BR-CTA-VPN  OTHERS
5       CN-TSN-VPN  OTHERS
2040    FR-LYON     Files that are at least in Pool or MDA
248     FR-LYON     OTHERS
1       IN-BLR      Files that are at least in Pool or MDA
1       IN-PUNE     OTHERS
810     JP-SAIT     OTHERS
48      JP-SAIT     Files that are at least in Pool or MDA
...
</code></pre>

<p>And I would like to have this:</p>

<pre><code>94%         BR-CTA      Ratio -- 94% in OTHER
100%        BR-CTA-VPN  Ratio -- 100% in OTHER
100%        CN-TSN-VPN  Ratio -- 100% in OTHER
10%         FR-LYON     Ratio -- 10% in OTHER
0%          IN-BLR      Ratio -- 0% in OTHER
100%        IN-PUNE     Ratio -- 100% in OTHER
94%         JP-SAIT     Ratio -- 94% in OTHER
...
</code></pre>

<p>But I can't acheive this whatever I try. <strong>How can I do this?</strong></p>

<p>I use <code>nbTotal / (nbOther) * 100</code> as ratio calculation.</p>

<p>The gyroscope sensor and accelerometer sensor could handle this job in theory. But it seems the data is unreliable in pratice, according to some answers from stackoverflow.</p>

<p>I wonder it is true or not, and is there any other sensor or technology could be used to messure the short distance of phone movement?</p>

    var myURL = window.location.href;
    var dashIndex = myURL.lastIndexOf(""-"");

        $(""td#headerImage"").html($(result).text());

       ....etc etc
    });
});
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>My XML file looks like this.  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;sites&gt;
   &lt;site name=""Template""&gt; 
       &lt;headerImage&gt;images/template-header.png&lt;/headerImage&gt;
       &lt;productVersion&gt;[Version goes here]&lt;/productVersion&gt;
       &lt;systemStatus color=""green""&gt;Normal&lt;/systemStatus&gt;
       &lt;networkNotes&gt;System status is normal&lt;/networkNotes&gt;
    &lt;/site&gt;
&lt;/sites&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have several <code>&lt;site&gt;</code>s that all have their own data that will populate different areas of individual sites.  I've ran into a snag though.</p>

<p>The way I am displaying my status currently looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=""table_header""&gt;
        Current System Status
    &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

        &lt;td id=""status""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td class=""table_header""&gt;
        Network Notes
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Right now it's hard-coded to show the system status with either a red, green, or yellow bar behind the text to indicate the health of the system, but I need to make able to read the XML value for that site. </p>

<p>The tricky part is that I am also using data from a CSS for this particular portion of the site.  The CSS code relevant to this is (there is one for green, yellow, and red):</p>

<pre><code>#status[color=green] {
    color: white;
    text-align: left;
    background: url(images/greenbar.jpg) no-repeat;
}

#status[color=yellow] {
    color: black;
    text-align: left;
    background: url(images/yellow.jpg) no-repeat;
}

#status[color=red]{
    color: black;
    text-align: left;
    background: url(images/red.jpg) no-repeat;
}
</code></pre>

<p>**How can I read in the system status string, along with the element's attribute of <code>color</code> to populate my HTML so that each site has a different image depending on what's in the XML? **</p>

<p>I have tried the above and it gives a color background to the text, not the image url background.</p>

<p>And it reads the correct status but the image never appears behind it.</p>

<p>Let me explain it with an example project.</p>

<p>Lets say I want to make a site with multiple user types. I have a single database table with an enum ""type"" field. And I made classes like these:</p>

<pre><code>abstract class User {
 //common properties, functions etc.. like id, username.
}

class Admin extends User {
 protected $type = ""ADMIN"";
 //I want here to have admin specific fields, functions etc...
}
</code></pre>

<p>...and some other user types like that. Here is the thing. I want a common class that can save and update objects into database. What's the way to do that? I'll make an object like $user = new User(); bla.. bla.. and I'll say ""Save this user"" but how? Do I have to make functions for each of my classes that have specific SQL statements like ""INSERT INTO table(name, pass, etc) VALUES ('name', 'pass', etc)""?</p>

<p>Another point is I want a common factory class that returns me an object. An example I'll say ""Get me the user which have this id and instantiate it with admin class if that user is an admin or the other classes like that"".</p>

<p>And I need some help about ""how to instantiate like mysqli_fetch_assoc() result with objects"". That returns an array. Do I need to do like ""$object->setId(returned_array[""id""])""?</p>

<p>I've looked some books like PHP in Action, PHP Objects, Patterns and Practice but couldn't find this database specific topics. I hope I could explained it well and sorry for my bad English :)</p>

<p>After comparing response headers from two different servers, the site being served from the other server was not having this problem -- I noticed that its response header had this in it:</p>

<p>I got it working without problems with a RGB PBO (size: width*height*3).

<p>How i figure it should work is: 
PBO gets filled with noise (random uint8 0-63), Screentexture gets texsubimaged, 
and when rendering it onto the screen via quad, my fragmentshader replaces all the 
RED channel values with the corresponding colors from my palette and i get 8bit noise on the screen.</p>

<p>But i simply can't get it to work. I only get a black screen. If I set my fragcolor to the incoming

</code></pre>

<p>And i'd like to have a link from first page (page1.html) to second page (page2.html) so with option like <strong>page2.html#div1</strong> it would open selected #div. I've tried to workout with <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/9omfasdw/"" rel=""nofollow"">jsfiddle</a>:</p>

<pre><code>window.addEventListener(""hashchange"", function(){    
var targetDiv = $(location.hash);    
if(!targetDiv.is(':visible')){$('.page').slideUp();targetDiv.slideDown();}
else{$('.page').slideUp();} }, false);
</code></pre>

<p>but it's not working properly when you're givitn that link to some one and not working on some chrome versions at all...</p>

<p>Is there better idea or?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I have to create a number of UIButtons programmatically, which I have done, but the code gets quite messy when there are alot of buttons so I have written a method that will take a UIbutton, string and UIcolor as input and set the rest of the UIButton attributes for me.  The problem is the buttons don't seem to be created.  Is what I'm trying possible or am I going about it the wrong way.</p>

<p>The method</p>

<pre><code>-(void)makeButton:(UIButton *)name titleOfButton:(NSString *)title buttonColor:(UIColor *)color {

    name =[[UIButton alloc] initWithFrame:(CGRectMake(400,400,150,100))];

    name.titleLabel. numberOfLines = 0; // Dynamic number of lines
    name.titleLabel.lineBreakMode = UILineBreakModeWordWrap;
    name.titleLabel.textColor = [UIColor blackColor];

    [myView addSubview:name];
}

<p>and to call the method</p>

<pre><code>[self makeButton:JDLabel
