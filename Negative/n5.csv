<p>It outputs this:</p>

<p>So I have 2 choices: Symmetric and Asymmetric.</p>

<p>The issue I have is that with a symmetric key, I have to embed the password into an SP in order to read the column like:</p>

<pre><code>-- Create key (at some earlier point)
create symmetric key sk_user_profile with algorithm = aes_192 encryption by password = 'P@ssword!!';

-- Now encrypt the contents
-- open the key so that we can use it
open symmetric key sk_user_profile decryption by password = 'P@ssword!!';

UPDATE users
SET password_enc = encryptbykey(key_guid('sk_user_profile'), password_plain, 1, user_id)

close symmetric key sk_user_profile
</code></pre>

<p>Now if I want to select the data, I still have to re-open the key with</p>

<pre><code>open symmetric key sk_user_profile decryption by password = 'P@ssword!!';
</code></pre>

<p>Which is defeating the point isn't it, as I am embedding a plain-text password within a stored procedure.</p>

<p>Some questions</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there any way around this - i.e. creating a certificate with this password and then referring to the certificate instead?</li>
<li>Would this certificate have to be purchased (like SSL), or can I create my own?</li>
<li>Is this method scalable across fail-over clustered databases, i.e. the encryption is not based on the machine, only the password provided. Therefore failover can still read the passwords</li>

<p>I have a set of property page with same storage file.</p>

<p>The scenario is as follow..
For the first time opening the properties by right clicking on the project, list of property pages are viewed. I click on the first property page and make changes then apply the changes to the file.
Now I select the second page, it shows the changes that were applied from the first page.</p>

<p>But now without closing the properties i go back to first page and make changes then apply the changes.
Then again I go to second page it wont show the updated data. The changes that were applied are not viewed until I close the properties and reopen then by right clicking on the project.</p>

<p>My question is 
""Is there any way to reflect changes on the pages without closing the properties??""</p>

<p>I do undestand how the algorithm works but I cannot figure out how to build the input matrix if I have 2D space with coordinates. So let's just say I've detected 3 people in the frame:</p>

<pre><code>**Person1** on the coordinates [10, 20]
**Person2** on the coordinates [100, 125]
**Person3** on the coordinates [50, 200]
</code></pre>

<p>In the next frame there are still 3 persons detected on the new coordinates but now I want to know which one was <strong>Person1</strong>, which one was <strong>Person2</strong>, etc. in the previous picture.</p>

<p>Now I am not quite sure how to build the matrix.
The columns should be different people like this:</p>

<pre><code>+---------+-x1--y1--x2--y2--x3--y3-+
| Person1 |                        |
| Person2 |                        |
| Person3 |                        |
+---------+------------------------+

<p>And the values are the distances between current position and the last found ones?
I know it might seem stupid but I am confused.</p>

<p>During a Django view, you would use their Python client to batch HTTP POSTs to their web service in a separate (non-daemon) thread. Normally, I would go with RabbitMQ for something like this, instead of threads but they wanted to lower the startup costs for the library.</p>

<p>My question is, are there any downsides to this approach? Threads have some additional memory footprint, but I'm not too worried about that.  It obviously depends on the number of requests/threads started.</p>

<p>Is the fact that the threads are not daemons and potentially long running an issue?  I assume that the Gunicorn process is the main thread of execution and it runs in an infinite loop, so it generally doesn't matter if it has to wait on the non-daemon threads to exit.  Is that correct?</p>

<p>Kind of an open question but the main point is understanding the impact of non-daemon threads in Django/Gunicorn apps. </p>

typedef enum {
   UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait = (1 &lt;&lt; UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait),
   UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscapeLeft = (1 &lt;&lt; UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft),
   UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscapeRight = (1 &lt;&lt; UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight),

   UIInterfaceOrientationMaskAllButUpsideDown =
   (UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait | UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscapeLeft |
   UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscapeRight),
} UIInterfaceOrientationMask;
</code></pre>

<p>for an easy work lets simplify the enum:</p>

<pre><code>typedef enum {
   UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait = (1 &lt;&lt; 0),
   UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscapeLeft = (1 &lt;&lt; 1),
   UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscapeRight = (1 &lt;&lt; 2),
   UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortraitUpsideDown = (1 &lt;&lt; 3)
} UIInterfaceOrientationMask;
</code></pre>

<p>that means:</p>

<pre><code>typedef enum {
   UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait = 0001,
   UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscapeLeft = 0010,
   UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscapeRight = 0100,
   UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortraitUpsideDown = 1000
} UIInterfaceOrientationMask;
</code></pre>

<p>That is possible because this enum is using a C    bit shift:
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#Bit_shifts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#Bit_shifts</a></p>

<p>then when we write:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSUInteger)supportedInterfaceOrientations {
return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait | UInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscapeLeft;
}
</code></pre>

<p>in fact we are returning: 0011</p>

<p>Why? Because the binary OR</p>

<p>0001 OR 0010 = 0011</p>

<pre><code>0 OR 0 = 0
0 OR 1 = 1
1 OR 0 = 1
1 OR 1 = 1
</code></pre>

<p>So far, I understand.</p>

<p>But, how is the method checking which orientation is valid?</p>

<p>Because if we have a simple enumeration we are checking if is equals 0, 1, 2 or 3</p>

<pre><code>typedef enum {
   simpleZero,
   simpleOne ,
   simpleTwo ,
   simpleThree 
} simple;

int whatever = someNumber

if (whatever == simpleZero)
{
}
else if  (whatever == simpleOne)
{
}
.......
</code></pre>

<p>But, how the code is dealing with UIInterfaceOrientationMask? With Binary ANDs?</p>

<pre><code>if (returnFromSupportedInterfaceOrientations &amp; UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait ==     UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait)
{
// Do something
// Here is TRUE  0011 AND 0001 = 0001
}


if (returnFromSupportedInterfaceOrientations &amp; UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscapeLeft == UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscapeLeft)
{
// Do something
// Here is TRUE  0011 AND 0010 = 0010
}

if (returnFromSupportedInterfaceOrientations &amp; UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscapeLeft == UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscapeLeft)
{
// Do something
// Here is FALSE  0011 AND 0100 = 0000
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is that the way?</p>

<p>I have a class that says, in part, this:</p>

<pre><code>  File 
  {
    owner =&gt; 'root',
    group =&gt; 'root',
    mode =&gt; '0700',
    seluser  =&gt; 'system_u',
    selrole  =&gt; 'object_r',

  }
  file { ""/root/SEPreset.sh"" :
    ensure =&gt; file,
    source =&gt; $filesource,
  }
</code></pre>

<p>I'm going to draw to your attention that the SELinux context for this file is not the standard SELinux context for <code>/root</code> .</p>

<p>So I updated the source file.  On the next run, Puppet applied the new file.  On the next run after that, Puppet changed the SELinux context.</p>

<p>This says to me that, during the first run, Puppet</p>

<ul>
<li>checked the SELinux context and saw that it matched</li>
<li>checked the file content and saw that it was wrong</li>
<li>created a new file that inadvertently had the wrong context</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems to me that Puppet <strong>should</strong> have double-checked, after applying the new file, that <strong>all</strong> of the attributes were correct.  I would be very disappointed if, for example, it created a file but left the ownership or permissions set to whatever the default happened to be.</p>

<p>Is this a Puppet bug, or a mistake in my class definition, or a misunderstanding on my part?</p>

Hopefully the example speaks for itself: there's a WishlistReporter class which asks one object for data and outputs to another object. </p>

<p>The problem is that with the double for DB, I'm actually testing a whole bunch of things in a single example.  Which is not ideal.  </p>

<p>I can split the report() method into gather_data() and output() methods.  But that doesn't help: in order to test the output() method I would still need to create the mock db and run gather_data() again.</p>

<p>Is there a way around this?</p>

<pre><code>describe WishlistReporter do

  it ""should talk to the DB and output a report"" do
    db = double(""database"")
    db.should_receive(:categories).and_return([""C1""])
    db.should_receive(:items).with(""C1"").and_return([""I1"", ""I2""])
    db.should_receive(:subitems).with(""I1"").and_return([""S1"", ""S2""])
    db.should_receive(:subitems).with(""I2"").and_return([""S3"", ""S4""])

    wr = StringIO.new

    r = WishlistReporter.new(db)
    r.report(db, :text, wr)

    wr.seek(0)
    wr.read.should =~ /stuff/
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>(In reference to the previous question:  I'm perfectly happy to mock the Db class because I consider its interface to be external: part of the ""what"" not the ""how"".)</p>

"29463914","1","","","2015-04-06 00:42:08","","0","132","<p>Inside my django admin, I am creating an admin model that has a one to many relationship with another table. Let us call it <code>Recipes</code> and <code>Ingredients</code>. Each recipe has multiple ingredients. </p>

<p>I want to make it so in the admin page a user can create a recipe and add certain ingredients to it on the same page. So I am using the concept of <code>inline models</code>. The issue is that once certain ingredients have been created only a few fields should be allowed to be edited. So I've created two separate inline models -- one for editing and one for adding. </p>

<p>The other issue is that ingredient creation can only be done if the user has certain permissions. If the user does not have those permissions it still creates the ingredients but they are not <code>published</code>. They later have to get approved by someone with the correct permissions. Right now I am overriding the <code>formset</code> for the creating of the ingredient. It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class AddIngredientInlineFormset(forms.models.BaseInlineFormSet):
    model = Ingredient

    def save(self, commit=True):
        can_publish = self.request.user.has_perm('meals.publish_ingredient')
        for form in self.forms:
            if form.cleaned_data:
                Ingredient.objects.create(
                     is_published = can_publish, **kwargs
                )

class AddIngredientInline(admin.StackedInline):
    model = Ingredient
    formset = AddIngredientInlineFormset
    fields = ['name', 'amount', 'description']
    extra = 1

    def has_change_permission(self, request):
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>Then I have a separate inline class for editing:</p>

<pre><code>class EditIngredientInline(admin.StackedInline):
    model = Ingredient
    fields = ['name', 'amount', 'description']
    readonly_fields = ['name', 'amount']
    extra = 0
    can_delete = False

    def has_add_permission(self, request):
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>Then in my recipe admin model, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class RecipeAdmin(BaseModelAdmin):

    model = models.Recipe
    list_display = ['name']

    def add_view(self, request, form_url='', extra_context={}):
        self.inlines = [AddIngredientInline]
        return super(BaseModelAdmin, self).add_view(request, form_url, extra_context)

    def change_view(self, request, object_id, form_url='', extra_context={}):
        self.inlines = [EditIngredientInline, AddIngredientInline]
        return super(BaseModelAdmin, self).change_view(request, object_id, form_url, extra_context)
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine for adding recipes and ingredients for those recipes, and the display shows up fine for everything. However when I try to edit an existing ingredient for a given recipe I get the error: <code>IngredientFormFormSet' object has no attribute 'new_objects'</code></p>

<p>I imagine this is happening because I am not using <code>formset.save()</code> for the <code>AddIngredientFormSet</code>. Also this has begun to get fairly complicated, so I am wondering if there is a better way to check the permissions for publishing the inline ingredient and save that column correctly.</p>

What I want to do:</p>

<p>I have a large list of names and a user input like ""Hi Bob I am Sue"", which is given as a string. 
I want to take this string, look into the list of names and if the string contains a greeting and two names, grab the second name and print it in an output like this:
""Hi Sue, nice to meet you"".
The name ""Bob"" given in the example above will always be the same, so in my code I put it into a separate string, but the succeeding name can be any name (in fact, it can also be a name which is not in the name list but I don't know how to solve this yet, so that's a different matter).</p>

<p>What I've got so far is not much:</p>

<pre><code>String fixedname=new String('bob')
def name=[""bob"",""sue"",""peter"",""dr spock""] 
def greeting=[""hi"",""hello""] 
String input= new String ('Hi bob i am sue') 

if(input.contains(fixedname) || input.contains(greeting))

<p>""then look into the name list and print the name which comes after fixedname.""
I don't know how to put the sentence between the quotation marks into proper code. Can someone help or give me a hint please?</p>

<p>I have an app that reads from a usb to serial connection every second.  The app then update the MainActivity's UI with the new data.  My app also has a widget that is also updated with the new data as well.  This works well however when the onDestroy() method is called the widget stops working.</p>

<p>I have seen several apps where the widget continues to work and update even though the app has never been started. At least not to my knowledge.  </p>

<p>How is this done?  I would like my widget to run and function without the app even running. Is this possible?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Here is a snippet from my MainActivity's onCreate()</p>

<pre><code>@Override

    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

            handler.postDelayed(this, oneScd);
        }
    };
    handler.postDelayed(eachSec, oneScd);
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a my AppWidgetProvider code:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onUpdate(Context context, AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager, int[]      appWidgetIds) {
    try {
        updateWidgetContent(context, appWidgetManager);

    } catch (Exception e) {

    }
}

            handler.postDelayed(this, oneScd);
        }
    };
    handler.postDelayed(eachSec, oneScd);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my service that gets the response from the serial communication and sets the GlobalSpeed._json value.</p>

<pre><code>public class WidgetUpdateService extends Service {
public static final String DEBUG_TAG = ""SoleWidgetService"";

public static String json;

private SerialComunicator serComm;

    serComm = new SerialComunicator(this);

    buildUpdate();
}


private void buildUpdate(){
    HandlerThread hTh = new HandlerThread(""SHT"");
    final long oneScd = 4000;

    final Handler handler = new Handler(hTh.getLooper());

<p>}</p>

<p>Hope this is enough code.</p>

<p>This all works fine,  and when I go to the home screen and the app's onStop() method is called it works and the widget continues to up date. But when I remove the app from the recent apps and the onDestroy() method is called the widget ceases to update.</p>

<p>I would like the widget to function independent of the app.  I this possible?  I know of some widgets that <strong>SEEM</strong> to run independent of their app.</p>

<p>We have a WPF screen that is used to run and view reports.  Each report is a ""ReportViewModel.""  The collection of view models is managed in a ""ReportManagerViewModel"" that manages the collection of tabs which utilize the Caliburn.Micro.Conductor.</p>

<p>If we open an existing tab, the tab loads perfectly.  We then start a new tab, run a report, which brings focus to the new tab and populates its data.  This tab IS part of the collection of tabs now.  If we attempt to switch back to one of the already open tabs, the following occurs:</p>

<p>The first click (clicking on the pre-existing tab the first time) does nothing.  The second click crashes the application with the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>System.ArgumentException:  An item with the same key has already been added.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The funny thing is that when the active tab is switched, Conductor.ActivateItem() is called.  When the error is thrown, this method isn't even called.  </p>

<p>Using Visual Studio 2010, Caliburn.Micro v.1.5.2, Telerik WPF Controls Q3 2013 hot fix 1424.</p>

<p>Edit:  We now know that Telerik is not the cause as we switch from RadTabItem to TabItem and  we are not using the Caliburn.Micro.Conductor.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The problem i'm facing now is that my current application needs to be scalable to tens of millions of records. In the data model above, for each record i could possibly have many ACL entries. So if my records table (acltest_uspaceData) has 10 million rows my acl security tables could have a lot more.</p>

<p><strong>Is this an appropriate data model for the amount of records we plan on storing?</strong> If not,  <strong>What can i do to this datamodel to make it scalable?</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li>It's should be implied that nobody has access to anything if there
are not security associations made for that record.</li>
<li>To allow user or group access, you must explicitly Allow them to access
that record via some security association.</li>
<li>To deny someone access who already has access via group membership,
you must explicitly deny that person access to that record via a security association.</li>

I chose to use a ListView of CheckedTextView (with id checked_text), the ListView uses CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE of course.</p>

<p>Now, I am using the SQLite database to store the list items.</p>

<h2>To fill the list I have something like:</h2>

<pre><code>cursor = dbHelper.fetchAll();
startManagingCursor(cursor);

String[] from = new String[] {  DbAdapter.NAME };
int[] to = new int[] { R.id.checked_text };

SimpleCursorAdapter notes = new SimpleCursorAdapter(this,
R.layout.todo_multi_row, cursor, from, to);
listView.setAdapter(notes);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>This is working fine, it gets all the items in the DB and for each
item it creates a CheckedTextView with as text DbAdapter.NAME.</p>

<p>But what I really need is to get both the text, and the checked state,
and check the Rows accordingly.</p>

<p>Let's say I can get the state (as integer 0/1) from the DB using
DbAdapter.CHECKED.. how can I implement a cursor adapter that gets the
job done?</p>

<p>I searched everywhere (for instance <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2406937/android-save-checkbox-state-in-listview-with-cursor-adapter"">this question</a> which is a mess) but found nothing to solve this problem. Wah. 
It seemed so easy at first.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://developers.google.com/+/api/oauth?hl=en#scopes"" rel=""nofollow"">Google+ OAuth 2.0 scopes</a> new <code>plus.me</code> scope allows application to know who user is, and <code>plus.login</code> also gives additional access (to age, language, circles, ...).</p>

<p>If I replace <code>userinfo.profile</code> with <code>plus.me</code> - everything works Ok: method <code>WebServerClient.RequestUserAuthorization</code> authorizes user and <code>ProcessUserAuthorization</code> gives me a token.</p>

<p>But if I ask <code>plus.login</code> scope instead - Google adds additional query parameters to my callback and next call to <code>WebServerClient.ProcessUserAuthorization</code> fails , because implementation uses current rul to make new <code>redirect_url</code>, striping ""known"" parameters and leaving ""new unknown"" Google parameters. his <code>redirect_url</code> doesn't match on registered in Google Api Console and Google server returns 400 response.</p>

<p><a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2"" rel=""nofollow"">OAuth2 spec</a> says that params <code>code</code> and <code>state</code> are required in authorization response and says noting about adding other parameters. But it also says that</p>

  <p>The client MUST ignore unrecognized response parameters</p>

<p>Does this mean that this is DNOA issue and not Google one? </p>

<p>May be DNOA must add nullable responseUri parameter to ProcessUserAuthorization and use it instead of guessing from current url...</p>

<p>the date column I have in csv file is like this:</p>

<p>Date</p>

<p>03/17/2003</p>

<p>05/31/2003</p>

<p>09/06/2003</p>

<p>10/18/2003</p>

<p>07/15/2003</p>

<p>09/19/2003</p>

<p>The problem is some of the dates are in string and some are in actual date format. I have tried to format it from excel - didn't work
Tried to copy and paste it to notepad and then import it again - didn't work either.</p>

<p>I use to run into ""socket closed / network or timeout"" errors, and the trace showed clearly that on the callback it was looking for a listening endpoint, but couldn't find one.  Anyway, after adding the UseNetSerializer that error went away, yet now I'm just not getting anything.</p>

<p>PS. If I add all the commented out List items, I still retrieve an entry from the DB, but also still not receive anything on the client.</p>

<p>If I remove the  [UseNetDataContractSerializer] I get the following error(s) in the svclog:</p>

After compressing a file, I am encrypting it.  The decryption is successful, but the call to uncompress returns -3 (<code>Z_DATA_ERROR</code>, meaning the input data was corrupted).  As there are no errors being logged, I know that no exceptions are being thrown, and that the compression function is returning 0 (<code>Z_OK</code>, meaning it worked).  </p>

<p>Thus, I suspect the problem is that the <code>sCompressed</code> string is losing integrity on either the line ""<code>sCompressed = Left(sCompressed, lcompressedlen)</code>"" or the line ""<code>encryptedData.Content = sCompressed</code>.""  Alternatively, VB6 might be doing something <strike>stupid</strike> helpful to the contents of <code>sCompressed</code> during the call to <code>compress</code>.  I know that the return value of this function is not being corrupted later, because that would have broken decryption, which works fine.</p>

<p>Conclusion:<br>
I ended up making the program give an error message and quit if run on a machine with a suspicious character set.  It is quite likely that this bug still exists on a few settings and also likely that it does not exist on some of the settings that trigger the error.  However, since the target audience is English speakers, passing the Turkey Test is not important enough to justify actually spending more time on this.</p>

<p>I have an application that allows a user to run multiple concurrent queries via threads (up to 100 at once).</p>

<p>I have a class that I use for logging errors. If an error occurs in the application, I create an instance of the class and call a procedure to write the error to a log file.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>I need to make the error logging code thread safe. I've noticed that if a lot of threads are running at the same time and generating the same error (e.g. cannot connect to database), I'm getting i/o error 32 (caused by the application attempting to write to a file that's already open).</p>

<p>As a quick and dirty fix, I've put the code that writes to file in a try... except block inside a repeat loop. If there is an exception (e.g. the file has already been opened by another instance of the class, kicked off by another thread), then it sets a flag to ""false"". The loop continues to execute until the flag is ""true"" (i.e. no error writing to file), as follows:</p>

<pre><code>procedure TErrorLogging.logError(error: string);
var
     f: textfile;
     ok: boolean;
begin
     repeat
          ok := true;
          try
               assignfile(f, fLogFilename);
               if fileExists(fLogFilename) then append(f) else rewrite(f);
               writeln(f, error);
               closefile(f);
          except
               ok := false;
          end;
     until ok;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm aware that the correct way to protect blocks of code is by using Critical Sections, but I'm not sure how I'd implement that, given that there are a number of different threads that use the logging class, and each instance of the thread has its own instance of the logging class that it uses to write to file (so they're not all just synchronizing against the same block of code).</p>

<p>The options, as I can see them:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the code as above. Are there any issues with leaving this code as it is? It's a quick and dirty fix, but it works.</li>
<li>Use a global TCriticalSection (how?).</li>
<li>Use a single procedure somewhere that creates an instance of the logging class, which the threads will synchronize against (which defeats the object of having a logging class, I suppose).</li>
</ol>

<p>Since i'm only intrested in getting the <strong>XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX</strong> (WAN IP) i do a preg_match to get the IP from $result. Here comes the problem. I always get this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Undefined offset: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically it means that preg_match can't find any match. I use this code to match the IP:</p>

<pre><code>$regex = '/\IP = ([^\""]*?)\ /';
preg_match($regex, $result, $matches);
</code></pre>

<p>It matches the IP properly. In fact if i try with something like this it works.</p>

<pre><code>$result = ""sys ddns display DDNS Status state = 0, flags = 1 pauseTime = 0, timerID = 0 startcnt = 2, stopcnt = 1 retrycnt = 0, eventqcnt = 0 socketID = -1 DomainName = eMail Address = update IP = XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX update time = 00:00:00 Thu. Jan. 01, 1970 retCode = good tc&gt; "";

<p>Is there a simpler and cleaner way to do it?</p>

<p>Edit: For background, I agree with Raymond Chen's post <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/04/447654.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""The Old New Thing: Double-clicking radio buttons"">here</a> that the ability to double click on a radio button (if those are the <em>only</em> controls on the dialog) makes the dialog just a tiny bit easier to use for people who know about it.</p>

<p>In Vista using Task Dialogs (see <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511268.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""MSDN: Dialog Boxes"">this Microsoft guideline page</a> or <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb787471%28VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""MSDN: Task Dialogs"">this MSDN page specifically about the Task Dialog API</a>) would be the obvious solution, but we don't have the luxury of that.</p>

<p>According to me, when we try to access the members of a structure using the address of an instance of the structure, we must use the <code>-&gt;</code> operator rather than the <code>.</code> operator. I know that we do it only in case a pointer,but as far as I know, array is functionally equivalent to a pointer. Please help me where I am going wrong with my concepts. And pardon my silly question, because I am just a beginner.</p>

I'm attempting to trace through the code as it executes in order to understand what it's doing.  Unfortunately, as soon as the user gains control over the application, I need to have a breakpoint set on an event handler in order to start following again in the debugger.  If I try to step through the code line by line, then the user will never gain control of the application, since it starts walking step by step through the idle routines instead.</p>

<p>What I need is to determine the name of the event handler associated with a button before I click it.  That way, I can set a break point on that event handler and walk through the associated code as soon as it's been pressed.</p>

<p>Due to the size of the application, manually setting break points at every event handler is not feasible.  If there were an easy way to set breakpoints on all lines that contained a certain pattern, then that would work too.  I could search (alt+e+f+i) for '::On' and set breakpoints on the thousands of resulting hits all at once.  I'd have to manually deselect all the breakpoints that got triggered inadvertently that way, but this would still work.  Is there a way to do this?</p>

<p>Additionally, I've tried searching through the resource viewer and finding something that looked like the button I want, but have been unable to find it.  Even if I did, I'm not sure how that would help.  Shouldn't there be a nice easy list somewhere that lists graphical elements alongside their associated events?</p>

Unfortunately, the syntax for insert and update SQL statements is completely different: Insert takes a list of columns followed by a corresponding list of values, while update takes a list of column=value pairs. The MySQL ""insert...on duplicate key update"" statement (its upsert statement) doesn't solve this problem, as it still requires the complete insert column/value lists followed by the complete update column/value list. [UPDATE: Comment from Wrikken below points out that the two statements can share the column=value syntax, but the other issues remain.]</p>

<p>Related to this problem is that if you're using triggers to check the data (as I do), you need two triggers (before-insert and before-update), and, as they have to use the ""new"" qualifier, you have to either write the checking code twice, once for each trigger, or put it into a procedure. If you use a procedure, you have to pass each column as a separate parameter, because the procedure can't use ""new"", which is a lot of potentially error-prone typing if you have a lot of columns. Each column has to have its type in the create table statement and then a second time in the definition of the checking procedure. Once little mistake and you've created a subtle, hard-to-find bug. I don't like any approach that involves coding the same thing twice. (It's the equivalent of non-normalization.)</p>

<p>Thinking about this insert/update problem, I've been toying with the following idea, and I'd like some feedback, especially if anyone has actually tried it:</p>

<p>Use insert only for a placeholder row, holding only the minimal amount of data, and to get or set the primary key. Then, put all of the user-entered data into an update statement. Now, you don't need ""insert...on duplicate key update"", as plain update will do. Also, you need to check data only on a before-update trigger, as there is nothing to check on an insert. (All user-supplied data from the entry form is handled by the update, never by the insert.)</p>

<p>The chief disadvantage of this method, of course, is that there are two operations for a new row: insert followed by update, instead of an insert. But, that may not be a factor because:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Inserts may be relatively rare. For example, in a student grading application I did a few years ago for the Richardson (TX) School District, only a couple of thousand or so students were added each year, whereas there were tens of thousands of updates, as the teachers used the system throughout the school year.</p></li>
<li><p>In several other systems I've built, performance was irrelevant. For example, a current system I'm working on has only two or three people updating the database for only a few hours a week. The load is so small that the overhead caused by two operations (insert + update) when only one would suffice is insignificant. (It's only for new rows, remember.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, has anyone actually tried this: Insert only to create a minimalist, placeholder row, and use update for all user-supplied-data updates?</p>

<p>Actually I need to add multiple shortcuts in runtime  to  the app-menu, which 
then all open one specific activity with different bundles.
So not <em>just adding launcher</em> flag to the <em>manifest</em>.</p>

<p>Does anybody know if and how that is possible and can maybe provide some 
sources if not?</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> Ok, maybe if nobody knows how to achieve that, maybe there is a way to change 
a launcher shortcuts label and iconImage programmatically in runtime? Again, App-menu, not homescreen.</p>

<pre><code>if (check_1() == false) {

<p>My issue is that I want one of the verification to overridable by the user, like the <code>check_2</code> below :</p>

<pre><code>if (check_1() == false) {
    popup(MSG_1);
    return false;
}
if (check_2() == false) {
    boolean res = popup_with_override(MSG_2);   // confirmation dialog

    // otherwise continue with the validation tests
}
if (check_3() == false) {
    popup(MSG_3);
    return false;
}

<p>I tried to use a confirmation dialog like the class below, but it does not fit well with the idea of a list of tests that get verified one after the other.</p>

<pre><code>public abstract static class DialogCallback implements DialogInterface.OnClickListener, Runnable {
    public DialogCallback(Context c, String q) {
        AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(c);
        builder.setMessage(q)

                .setNegativeButton(""No"", this);
        builder.create().show();
    }

    public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
        dialog.dismiss();
        if (which == DialogInterface.BUTTON_POSITIVE) {
            mWhich = DialogInterface.BUTTON_POSITIVE;

            run();
        }
    }

    //
    public int mWhich;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since the alert dialog is not blocking in Android, I think the approach has to be rewritten : like separating the overridable validations from the other verifications ?</p>

<p>Any idea ?</p>

<p>I've tried to do some research about this, but there seems to be limited knowledge about this part of WinRT.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I'm going to start a bounty on this because I really don't understand it and Google/Microsoft are unusually barren when I search for this. So the questions to receive the bounty are:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the details around the build/deployment process of a WinRT/Windows Store app?</li>
<li>What's actually going on during the ""Creating a new clean layout..."" stage?</li>
<li>What is the difference between a traditional executable and a Windows 8 app that runs in a sandbox environment? How are these apps launched/managed?</li>

<p>After a user signs into the SSO login page, they are redirected back to our site, and that domain sets the user_id which was authenticated in the REMOTE_USER request header so that we know they logged in and were authenticated externally. If a user navigates to another page, that request header will no longer be available, so we are trying to store that user_id in a session.</p>

<p>Our existing code base uses a lot of Django generic class views, so we've written a decorator for the views that require a login (profile page, etc), which stores the user_id into a session.</p>

<p>Here's the strange part: the user logs in, we set the user_id in the session in the decorator. The value shows up on the page we set the session on, however on all the other pages, the session value is empty (maybe it was cleared?).</p>

<p>It can be done on multiple documents, and one name is always replaced by the same counterpart, so you can still understand who the text is talking about. BUT, all documents have an ID, referring to the person this file is about (I'm working with files in a public service) and only documents with the same people ID will be de-identified the same way, with the same names. (the goal is to watch evolution and people's history) This is a security measure, such as when I hand over the tool to a third party, I don't hand over the key to my own documents with it.</p>

<p>So the same input, with a different ID, produces :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We got a report that &lt;name&gt;Henry&lt;/name&gt; met &lt;name&gt;Alicia&lt;/name&gt; yesterday. &lt;name&gt;Henry&lt;/name&gt; is suspicious.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm hashing each name with the document ID as a salt, I convert the hash to an integer, then subtract the length of the name list until I can request a name with that integer as an indice. But I feel like there should be a quicker/more straightforward approach ?</p>

It works sometimes but most of the time it doesn't.</p>

<p>And by 'it works' I mean the html is returned from the method and then stored in the $html variable.

<p>So is there anything wrong with how I approach this?
Is there an alternative that I can do to achieve the same result? Thanks in advance!</p>

The TextBlock always populates fine, but the Image, once in a while, does not get loaded for one or two items. If I refresh the data source, the image correctly displays. I think the issue is with the timing (all data fetching is done asynchronously).
Here is the code that fetches the images from disk. All images are 140x140 pixels and are PNG files.</p>

<pre><code>public async Task&lt;List&lt;BitmapImage&gt;&gt; getPhotos()
        {
            photos.Clear(); //clears list of photos

            IReadOnlyList&lt;IStorageFile&gt; files = (IReadOnlyList&lt;IStorageFile&gt;)await folderHierarchy.Last().GetFilesAsync(); //reads in all files from current working directory

            foreach (StorageFile currentFile in files) //for each file in that directory
            {
                if (currentFile.Name.EndsWith("".png"")) //only handle png files
                {
                    photos.Add(await getBitmapImageAsync(currentFile)); //actually read in image from separate async method (bellow)
                }
            }

            return photos;
        }

        public async Task&lt;BitmapImage&gt; getBitmapImageAsync(StorageFile storageFile)
        {
            BitmapImage image = new BitmapImage();
            FileRandomAccessStream stream = (FileRandomAccessStream) await storageFile.OpenAsync(FileAccessMode.Read);
            image.SetSource(stream);

            return image;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>I run this method using: List tilePicturesArray = await dataFetcherClass.getPhotos();
The original photos List does not contain all of the photos. Something wrong is happening in that first block of code (above). 
The next step is when I populate the Image and TextBox via in my List (GridViewCell is a class that I made to bind data in my GridView) The list of GridViewCell objects is what is binded to my GridView. I don't believe that this is the issue.</p>

<pre><code>for (int x = 0; x &lt; tileTitlesArray.Count; x++) //this IS running inside of an async method
            {
                GridViewCell singleCell = new GridViewCell();

                singleCell.tileName = tileTitlesArray.ElementAt(x);
                singleCell.tileImage = tilePicturesArray.ElementAt(x);

                tileCells.Add(singleCell); //tileCells is the datasource for gridview
            }
</code></pre>

<p>What do you think would be causing the issue? I added a little refresh button which basically reruns the above loop (to repopulate the gridview datasource and tiles) but does not refetch the tilePicturesArray, so the binding is done using the same original List of BitmapImages (and the same tiles are still missing pictures)</p>

I thought this was a trivial task, until I learned that some sequences that cause no problems inside a .js file, can result in undesired functionality if embedded inside the script tags of an HTML file.</p>

<p>For example, if a .js file with valid javascript code contains sequences such as:</p>

<pre><code>/*
    ...comments...
    Add the following to your HTML:
    &lt;script language=""javascript"" src=""samplejs.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    ...comments...
 */
</code></pre>

<p>...then those sequences, when embedded inside the script tag of an HTML file, will cause problems when the interpreter hits the line </p>

<pre><code>""&lt;script language=""javascript"" src=""samplejs.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;""
</code></pre>

<p>(At least this is the case in Firefox.)</p>

<p>Since the regex...</p>

<pre><code>""\&lt;script.*\&gt;.*\&lt;/script\&gt;""
</code></pre>

<p>...will catch script tags even if they appear as part of string literals. ie:</p>

<pre><code>document.write('&lt;div&gt;&lt;script&gt;doSomething()&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;')
</code></pre>

<p>...is the solution to the problem a more robust regex (something along the lines of</p>

<pre><code>""/\*.*\&lt;.*\&gt;.*\&lt;/.*\&gt;.*\*/""

Building a simple working example is easy, but I feel like I'm missing something.  Once I step past a simple one-table/one-dependency example I'm left wondering  <em>how can I figure out which dependency triggered my callback?</em></p>

<p>I'm having a bit of trouble explaining, so I included the simple example below.  When <code>AChange()</code> is called I cannot look at the sql inside the dependency, and i don't have a reference to the associated cache object.</p>

<p>So what's a boy to do?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1</strong> -  create a distinct function for each object i want to track and hard code the cache-key (or relevant information) in the callback.  This feels dirty &amp; eliminates the posibility of adding new cache items without deploying new code--ewww.</li>
<li><strong>Option 2</strong> -  Use the Dependency <code>Id</code> property and a parallel tracking structure</li>
</ul>

<p>Am I just missing something?  Is this a deficiency in the <code>SQLDependency</code> structure?  I've  I've looked at 20 different articles on the topic and all of them seem to have the same hole.  Suggestions?</p>

<p>In pseudo-code, what I'm trying to do is this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach $term (@array1) {
    if ($term is found in @array2) { 
        #do something here
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've got the ""foreach"" and the ""do something here"" parts down-pat ... but everything I've tried for the ""if term is found in array"" test does NOT work ...</p>

<p>I've tried grep:  </p>

<pre><code>if grep {/$term/} @array2 { #do something }
# this test always succeeds for values of $term that ARE NOT in @array2

if (grep(/$term/, @array2)) { #do something }
# this test likewise succeeds for values NOT IN the array
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried a couple different flavors of ""converting the array to a hash"" which many previous posts have indicated are so simple and easy ... and none of them have worked.</p>

<p>I am a long-time low-level user of perl, I understand just the basics of perl, do not understand all the fancy obfuscated code that comprises 99% of the solutions I read on the interwebs ... I would really, truly, honestly appreciate any answers that are explicit in the code and provide a step-by-step explanation of what the code is doing ... </p>

<p>... I seriously don't grok $_ and any other kind or type of hidden, understood, or implied value, variable, or function. I would really appreciate it if any examples or samples have all variables and functions named with clear terms ($term as opposed to $_) ... and describe with comments what the code is doing so I, in all my mentally deficient glory, may hope to possibly understand it some day.  Please.  :-)</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I have an existing script which uses 'grep' somewhat succesfully:</p>

<pre><code>$rc=grep(/$term/, @array);
if ($rc eq 0) { #something happens here }
</code></pre>

<p>but I applied that EXACT same code to my new script and it simply does NOT succeed properly ... i.e., it ""succeeds"" (rc = zero) when it tests a value of $term that I know is NOT present in the array being tested.  I just don't get it.</p>

<p>The ONLY difference in my 'grep' approach between 'old' script and 'new' script is how I built the array ... in old script, I built array by reading in from a file:</p>

<pre><code>  @array=`cat file`;
</code></pre>

<p>whereas in new script I put the array inside the script itself (coz it's small) ... like this:</p>

<pre><code>  @array=(""element1"",""element2"",""element3"",""element4"");
</code></pre>

<p>How can that result in different output of the grep function?  They're both bog-standard arrays!  I don't get it!!!! :-(</p>

########################################################################

<h3>addendum ... some clarifications or examples of my actual code:</h3>

########################################################################

<p>The term I'm trying to match/find/grep is a word element, for example ""word123"". </p>

<p>This exercise was just intended to be a quick-n-dirty script to find some important info from a file full of junk, so I skip all the niceties (use strict, warnings, modules, subroutines) by choice ... this doesn't have to be elegant, just simple.  </p>

<p>The term I'm searching for is stored in a variable which is instantiated via split:</p>

<pre><code>foreach $line(@array1) {
  chomp($line);  # habit

  # every line has multiple elements that I want to capture
  ($term1,$term2,$term3,$term4)=split(/\t/,$line);  

  # if a particular one of those terms is found in my other array 'array2'
  if (grep(/$term2/, @array2) { 
    # then I'm storing a different element from the line into a 3rd array which eventually will be outputted
    push(@known, $term1) unless $seen{$term1}++;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>see that grep up there? It ain't workin right ... it is succeeding for all values of $term2 even if it is definitely NOT in array2 ... array1 is a file of a couple thousand lines. The element I'm calling $term2 here is a discrete term that may be in multiple lines, but is never repeated (or part of a larger string) within any given line. Array2 is about a couple dozen elements that I need to ""filter in"" for my output. </p>

<p>... </p>

<p>I just tried one of the below suggestions:  </p>

<pre><code>if (grep $_ eq $term2, @array2) 
</code></pre>

<p>And this grep failed for all values of $term2 ... I'm getting an all or nothing response from grep ... so I guess I need to stop using grep. Try one of those hash solutions ... but I really could use more explanation and clarification on those.</p>

Unfortunately they are explaining how to copy string from one activity to another activity.</p>

<p><strong>My intention</strong>: User opens default browser of mobile phone, highlights text and clicks the button which will be added by me on menu and needed activity is opened with highlighted (copied) text</p>

<p><strong>Tried</strong>: I have added intent filter to activity, then added action (android.intent.action.SEARCH) and category (android.intent.category.DEFAULT) into intent-filter. I thought, link for activity will be in Search section after Google, Google Translate, Wikipedia, Dictionary. Also, tried android.intent.action.ACTION_SEARCH_LONG_PRESS. Also, android.intent.action.SEND. Why it is not working, I have no idea.</p>

<p><strong>Tried(2)</strong>: Found answer for my question partially from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/2886556/2752399"">here</a>. But link for activity will be in Share->Share as Text->Activity. I think it is too long way.</p>

  <p>Question 2: If it is possible, how to do that? How to make the button so
  that when it is clicked, highlighted text should be send to my
  activity?</p>

<li>Why is security important when in Android?</li>

<p>I know that this may be a trivial question, but isn't ID and Password good enough for security?(especially on android?)</p>

<p>If I change the css to float left then the input field shrinks down. I'm sure this is something simple that I am just missing being new to css. </p>

<p>Decent chunk of stuff, css and html are parts that matter, so here is a fiddle and excerpt that I believe is the culprit.</p>

<pre><code>#to-address ul li, #from-address ul li {
list-style-type: none;
width: auto;
float: left;
/* ^^^ remove this line =&gt;full size bar, tag acts as block level element */}

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT1:
To clarify, because I kind of left it out, the goal is to have a input bar where the user can click any where in the bar, why it needs to fill the width. It should allow the user to continue typing beside the newly created tag. The <code>float: left;</code> line allows it to stay inline with the tags but overrides the <code>width: 100%</code> effect that allows the user to click any where to start typing.</p>

<p>Is there an equivalent to <code>On Error GoTo Next</code> for ADODB connections in Excel VBA?</p>

<p>I have a stored procedure I'm calling using an ADODB.Command object.  The problem is, if any one statement in that stored procedure throws an error, the entire process gets shut down.  Yes, that's appropriate in some cases, but in my case, it's not a big deal, I'd just like it to continue executing the rest of the stored procedure anyway.</p>

<p><code>On Error GoTo 0</code> shows the SQL error message and gives options to ""End"" or ""Debug"".</p>

<p><code>On Error Resume Next</code> skips the SQL error message, but silently cancels the SQL command and moves the next VBA statement.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><b>EDIT:</b> I've had a request for my code.  I'm not sure it will help you much, but here:</p>

<pre><code>On Error GoTo 0

ServerConnection.Open ""Provider=MSDASQL.1;Persist Security Info=True;Extended Properties=""DRIVER=SQL Native Client;Trusted_Connection=Yes;SERVER=DBServer;DATABASE=Database"";""

Dim SqlCommand As ADODB.Command
Set SqlCommand = New ADODB.Command

With SqlCommand
    .ActiveConnection = ServerConnection
    .CommandText = ""EXEC CacheTables @CacheTableType1=True""
    .CommandType = adCmdText
    .Execute
End With

ServerConnection.Close

Set SqlCommand = Nothing
Set ServerConnection = Nothing
</code></pre>

<p>I don't really control the stored procedure, unfortunately, but the reason it's throwing errors is that the person who wrote it used RAISERROR statements to tell the user where the execution is up to.  This is fine in SQL Server, which understands the ""Priority"" flag and hence continues executing, but VBA appears to consider all errors to be the same importance.</p>

The result of <code>multiQuery.List()</code> is an <code>ArrayList</code> of <code>ArrayLists</code>. So far so good. However, the individual <code>ArrayLists</code> contain values of type <code>{object[0]}</code> or, if I use a result transformer, properties with their value set to <code>null</code>. I won't list the entire set of SQL queries here but this is what my multi query looks like:</p>

<pre><code>        var multiQuery = Session.CreateMultiQuery()
            .Add&lt;IList&lt;DTO1&gt;&gt;(""query1"", query1)

<p>if I am going to use ref-counted smart pointers</p>

<p>invasive smart pointers is the way to go</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>However, I'm starting to like non-invasive smart pointers due to the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>I only use smart pointers (so no Foo* lying around, only Ptr)</li>
<li>I'm starting to build custom allocators for each class. (So Foo would overload operator new).</li>
<li>Now, if Foo has a list of all Ptr (as it easily can with non-invasive smart pointers).</li>
<li>Then, I can avoid memory fragmentation issues since class Foo move the objects around (and just update the corresponding Ptr).</li>
</ol>

<p>The only reason why this Foo moving objects around in non-invasive smart pointers being easier than invasive smart pointers is:</p>

<p>In non-invasive smart pointers, there is only one pointer that points to each Foo.</p>

<p>In invasive smart pointers, I have no idea how many objects point to each Foo.</p>

<p>Now, the only cost of non-invasive smart pointers ... is the double indirection. [Perhaps this screws up the caches].</p>

<p>Does anyone have a good study of expensive this extra layer of indirection is?</p>

<p>EDIT: by smart pointers, I may be referring to what others call ""shared-pointers""; the whole idea is: there is a reference-count attached to objects, and when it hits 0, the object is automatically deleted</p>

<li>example.com/index.php?cat=email</li>
<li>example.com/index.php?cat=about&amp;show=some</li>
</ul>

<p>with help of .htaccess RewriteEngine i've convered them to:</p>

<ul>
<li>example.com/email/</li>
<li>example.com/about/some/</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is part of .htaccess:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^([A-Za-z0-9-]+)/$ index.php?cat=$1 [L]
RewriteRule ^([A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([A-Za-z0-9-]+)/$ index.php?cat=$1&amp;show=$2 [L]
RewriteRule ^([A-Za-z0-9-]+)$ index.php?cat=$1 [L]
RewriteRule ^([A-Za-z0-9-]+)/([A-Za-z0-9-]+)$ index.php?cat=$1&amp;show=$2 [L]

<p>Now problem is that most of content have inside links like: ""example.com/index.php?cat=about&amp;show=some"" Changing them all is option, but anyway... is there anything else could be done? I heard of some .htaccess option that autoconverts links to format you need without changing them manualy, so all links in PHP pages will be the same, but once user gets page loaded, links will be like (example.com/about/some/) Is there anything like that, or is there any other option to leave original link without changing them all?</p>

More specifically I would like to know where the aggregation of the data of all partitions will take place? The aggregation either takes place in master or in workers. In the first case each worker send its data on master and when the master collects the data from each one worker, then master will aggregate the results. In the second case the workers are responsible to aggregate the results(after they exchange the data among them) and after that the results will be sent to the master.</p>

<p>It is critical for me to find a way so as the master to be able collect the data from each partition separately, without workers exchange data.</p>

<p>As the xml file above, how can I read data('status') tagged in different segments. 
I was trying to use filestorge and filenode to do this, but I didn't find any samples demonstrating it. 
If I can get access to the child Node, the problem will be solved. 
Is there any way to get access to one node's child node in xml with OPENCV?
Please feel free to throw any thoughts or examples. Appreciate it. </p>

My minSDKVersion is 11. I do it in this way: activity layout contains a view:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;View
    android:id=""@+id/bgFadingView""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:alpha=""0""
    android:background=""@android:color/black"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and method where I fade screen is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>protected void fadeBGView(boolean fadeIn)
{
    ObjectAnimator animator = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(bgFadingView, ""alpha"", fadeIn ? 0.75f : 0f); //bgFadingView is initialized via findViewById(R.id.bgFadingView);
    animator.setDuration(1000);
    animator.start();
}
</code></pre>

<p>in other words, I have black view, which occupies the whole screen and when I need to fadeIn, I change view's alpha from 0 to 0.75.</p>

<p>The problem is that it works with bad framerate... I see fading animation frame by frame - it works at about 15fps. What am I doing wrong? Android system fading works much more smoothly - I want to archieve the same result or close. How to?</p>

<p>I have a class named TravelOffer. This class looks like this:</p>

<p>As u see there are the following attributes: </p>

<p><code>User tavelCreator</code> and <code>List&lt;User&gt; participantsList</code></p>

<p>What i am wondering is should it be like this or simply to replace the User object with an <strong>String userId</strong> and then from a singleton class to get the User object which will be in a Hashmap.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>It works perfectly on all browsers and it works on the ipad if the image isn't too big. When the image is too big, it automatically gets resized to fit the screen. Tapping on a certain spot on the image will now give different coordinates then when it would stay in the original size. </p>

<p>When I have a ref object and I am making an ambiguous call to f, I would like the compiler to choose the one involving T&amp;. But in other unambiguous cases I wish the implicit conversion to remain the same.</p>

<p>So far I have tried introducing an intermediate class which ref is implicitly convertible to, and which has an implicit conversion operator to T*, so the conversion sequence would be longer. Unfortunately it did not recognize in unambiguous cases that it is indeed convertible to T*. Same thing happened when the intermediate class had a(n implicit) constructor. It's no wonder, this version was completely unrelated to ref.</p>

<p>I also tried making one of the implicit conversion operators template, same result.</p>

<p>I programmed in C for years (many years ago) and would have thought this would be a syntax error. I think it has something to do with optimizing the loop, but I was wondering if someone could explain what it does. What happens when a <code>while(1)</code> is reached, does it effectively go back to the switch? And in particular why are there two do..while's in there? </p>

<p>By the way, I <em>don't</em> want to start a discussion on the use of <code>goto</code> or if this is bad design. I didn't write this and I assume the author did it this way because it made the loop run as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Trying to query my DB through a RIA service from my silverlight client, I ran into the following problem. The goal is getting a list of menus and submenus. (Note: I only have a 2 level menus list, so only 1 main menu and multiple submenus, but those submenus don't/can't contain other submenus ).</p>

<p>First part:</p>

<pre><code>public void LoadMenus(Action&lt;ObservableCollection&lt;Menu&gt;&gt; callback)
    {
        _context.Load(_context.GetMenusQuery(), lo =&gt;
                                                    {
                                                        var menus = new EntityList&lt;Menu&gt;(_context.Menus, lo.Entities);
                                                        foreach (var m in menus.Where(x =&gt; x.Parent == x.MenuID))
                                                        {
                                                            foreach (var sm in LoadMenusByParentID(m.MenuID))
                                                            {
                                                                m.SubMenus.Add(sm);
                                                            }
                                                        }
                                                        callback.Invoke(menus);
                                                    }, null);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The loadMenusByParentID non working version:</p>

<pre><code>private IEnumerable&lt;Menu&gt; LoadMenusByParentID(int parentID)
    {
        var lo = _context.Load(_context.GetMenusByParentIDQuery(parentID));
        var m = new EntityList&lt;Menu&gt;(_context.Menus, lo.Entities);
        return m;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>working version:</p>

<pre><code>private IEnumerable&lt;Menu&gt; LoadMenusByParentID(int parentID)
    {
        return _context.Menus.Where(m =&gt; m.Parent == parentID &amp;&amp; m.MenuID != parentID);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Trying to put down good practice, I intend to use the Load() function (also because it's and async operation). But for some reason I'm not getting a result from it, while when I LinqQuery the context itself I do get a result.</p>

<p>My Service method for the non working version looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public IQueryable&lt;Menu&gt; GetMenusByParentID(int parentID)
    {
        return ObjectContext.Menus.Where(m =&gt; m.Parent == parentID &amp;&amp; m.MenuID != parentID);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Anybody has any idea why the bloody thing ain't working? </p>

<p>Big thanks in advance!

                        &lt;p&gt;
                            Most pistols are semi-automatic and are easier to shoot than revolvers, although they are much more complicated to operate. Revolvers, especially the Taurus Judge or the Smith &amp; Wesson Governor, are very viable for home-defense weapons because they can
                            use either .410 shotgun shells or .45 Long Colt ammo.

                        &lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;/h3&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;
                            The shotgun is considered to be the ultimate home-defense weapon. While very effective there are some drawbacks to using a shotgun in your home. A shotgun is designed to be operated with two hands for accuracy. This makes is more difficult to move about
                            the house with ease. The “scatter of the pellets” could also be a major concern. Rifles, AR-15 and others, are very popular right now, but cost considerably more and still have issues with size and ammo availability.

                        &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;
                            All in all, no matter which gun you choose, become familiar with it. If you shoot it regularly, a firearm can save the lives of you and your family.

                        &lt;/p&gt;

                            Hand guns come in two basic types- Pistols and Revolvers. Revolvers, like the Smith &amp; Wesson Airweight or the Ruger LCR, have a visible rotating cylinder that holds 5 or 6 rounds of ammunition. Pistols are almost always semi-automatic. These include the
                            Bersa Thunder .380 and any of the Glocks. Pistols hold the ammunition in an internal magazine and generally hold more rounds than a revolver.

                        &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;
                            How you carry your self-defense weapon is more important than which gun you choose. If you can not access your gun quickly and easily, you might as well not have a gun at all. Holsters, either inside or outside the pants on the waist, seem to be the best
                            option since they are quick and have easy access. Other options include carrying in your pocket, purse or fanny pack. A firearm should always be holstered not matter which way you decide to carry.
                        &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

                        Class 3 weapons, also known as NFA weapons, are machine guns, short barrel shotguns, short barrel rifles, and sound suppressors.
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        A machine gun is any gun that can fire more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger. Short barrel shotguns are any shotgun with a barrel length of less than 18” or an overall length of 26”. Short barrel rifles, similar to short barrel shotguns,
                        have a barrel length is less than 16”, while the overall length is also 26”.

                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        A sound suppressor or silencer is any device for muffling the sound of the gunshot. We carry brands such as Silencer Co. and Gemtec. We also sell rifles that the entire barrel is suppressed.

                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;The new GLOCK 42, in .380 AUTO, is a slimline subcompact pistol engineered with the GLOCK Perfection promise and able to withstand the rigors of routine training. Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making
                                        it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands. Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable single-stack .380 GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42.

<p>I have just started using html5 boilerplate and one problem I have come across is using the DW widget Flexslider2 which references the jquery-1.7.2.min.js from the head section in my document.</p>

<p>Boilerplate Modernizr references jquery-1.9.1.min.js at the end of the document so this cancels out 1.7.2.min and prevents the Slider from showing when the page is published, once the later script jquery-1.9.1.min.js is removed the Slider shows perfectly but does that mean that Modernizr script no longer functions?</p>

<p>The problem is obviously because the later script always overrides the 1st</p>

<p>If someone could explain how to get the 2 working from the same jquery library (preferably the latest version) I'd be forever in your debt.</p>

<p>Thanks Ian.</p>

<p>The object is constructed in C# using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; page = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;();
                updatedCountryNodesList.ForEach(x =&gt; page.Add(x.Id, x.Name));
</code></pre>

<p>When a request is made using a button in my HTML and Angular code this object is returned as part a general object to my Javascript code which is defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public class ResponseMessage
    {
        public bool Result { get; set; }
        public string Message { get; set; }
        public Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; Updates { get; set;}
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This object is then processed using the following function:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.getCountries = function() {
            $scope.loadCountries = true;
            $scope.info = [];
            getMessage(""Retreiving updates"");
            AxumTailorMade.getCountries().success(function (data) {
                if (!data.Result) {
                    notificationsService.error(""Error"", data.Message);
                } else if (data.Result) {
                    getMessage(""Content updated"");
                    console.log(data.Updates);
                    $scope.link = data.Updates;
                    notificationsService.success(""Success"", data.Message);
                }
                $scope.loadCountries = false;
            });
        };
</code></pre>

<p>The following is the output of the console.log within this code:</p>

<pre><code> Object { 5118=""Costa Rica"", 5129=""Ecuador and Galapagos"", 4851=""Venezuela""}
</code></pre>

<p>I am then using an ng-repeat as follows to loop through the keyValue pairs in the object and output a link using the key within the link href and the name within the link text.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""info-window""&gt;
            &lt;p ng-repeat=""item in info track by $index""&gt;{{item}}&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;div ng-repeat=""update in link""&gt;
                &lt;a ng-repeat=""(key, value) in update track by $index"" href=""/umbraco/#/content/content/edit/{{key}}""&gt;{{value}}&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, the problem I have is that this is not behaving in the way I would expect. When the code is returned, I am seeing this in my Firebug console suggesting it is parsing each letter of my value and making it into a link:</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;!-- ngRepeat: (key, value) in update track by $index --&gt;

Is it because under some circumstances we need check equality using <code>==</code>? Many thanks! </p>

<pre><code>boolean hasService(Service sd) { //Service is a class that has int, String and ArrayList as variable
    boolean hasService = false;
    for (int i=0; i&lt;.length; ++i) { //
        //doesn't work if change to ((serviceAvailable[i] ).equals(pd)), why? 
          if (serviceAvailable[i]==sd) //serviceAvailable is an Array stores different services
            hasService = true;
    }
    return hasService; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The class Service is as below:</p>

<pre><code> class Serivce {
    private String name;
    private int price;
    private ArrayList &lt;Customers&gt; customersErolled;
  //geters and setters methods

        return true;
    }else{
        return false;
    }

<li><p>Product management wants to be able to provide our customers with an app on Facebook where they would need to only add in their Form ID + Title, don't care about actual authentication with our product, just an ID to fetch.</p></li>
<li><p>The app would show up as a tab on their Facebook Page (and/or profile?) with the title of the tab showing what they entered and an iframe with the formId as the parameter to the source.. ie: the contents of that page tab would be a loaded iFrame: &lt;iframe src=""http://gotomyserver.com/fetch?FormId=123""></p></li>
<li><p>The idea is that our customers customers will see this form loaded up if they click on that tab on the page.</p></li>

A simple implementation is the following:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;
struct enumerator {
    T &amp;v; // reference to minimize copying
    enumerator(T &amp;_v) : v(_v) {}
    void do_enumerate() {

        for(auto x : v) {
            cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
            i++;
        }
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>This works ok for things like:</p>

<p><strong>Case A</strong></p>

<pre><code>vector&lt;int&gt; v({1,2,6,2,4});
auto e = enumerator(v);
e.do_enumerate();
</code></pre>

<p>However, I would also like it to handle temporary objects like:</p>

<p><strong>Case B</strong></p>

<pre><code>auto e = enumerator(vector&lt;int&gt;({2,3,9});
e.do_enumerate();
</code></pre>

<p>This does not work and the compiler throws:</p>

<pre><code>no matching function for call to ‘enumerator&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt; &gt;::enumerator(std::vector&lt;int&gt;)
</code></pre>

<p>So, I tried to then add a</p>

<pre><code>enumerator(T _t) : t(_T) {}
</code></pre>

<p>constructor to resolve this error. Now case A does not work and there is an error:</p>

<pre><code>error: call of overloaded ‘enumerator(std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp;)’ is ambiguous
</code></pre>

<p>Moreover, in case B, the output of the enumeration is not correct.</p>

<p>What is the cleanest way to solve this? I would </p>

<ul>
<li>really like both cases to be working</li>
<li>prefer not to use any libraries other than stdc++</li>
<li>want as little copying as possible (thus just storing a <code>T t</code> in the struct is not an option)</li>
<li>C++11 is not a problem. I have g++-4.8, which I presume has complete enough C++11 support.</li>

<p><strong>The solution needed:</strong>
Go through two two integer lists and compare for equality. Ideally I want it to continue going through the lists over and over till there is an equality (more on this after showing code). The number will be generated in list2 over and over till there is an equality. </p>

<p><strong>Explanation to code</strong>: I have two lists that are generated via a random number generation. The lists are not equal in size. So list1 has 500 entries and list2 will have different amounts varying from 1 to 100. </p>

<pre><code>#current attempt to figure out the comparison. 
if (list1 = list2):
     print(equalNumber)
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe I do not know much about looping, but I want it to loop through the list, I really do not know where to start from, maybe I'm not using a loop like a for loop or while?</p>

<p>What I did in 2.2.5 was just testing the framework using some small tables with no relations aka foreign keys constraints and the fixture import and auto-truncate table worked flawlessly.</p>

<p>Until I confirmed that I wanted to use cakephp and started developing my application using the CakeTestCase again. It stopped working. Data is still in the test database after they are imported the first time. So second time it would indicate that it fails to auto-load fixtures because data with the same IDs already exist. </p>

<p>So I started to suspect that it was mainly because the foreign key constraints I had in my current tables.</p>

<p>I searched the web and noticed that quite a lot of people having the same issue but there isn't a real solution to it yet.</p>

<p>The only one that seems to be a solution is here:
<a href=""http://cakephp.lighthouseapp.com/projects/42648/tickets/2905-tests-fixture-table-ar-not-truncate-when-droptable-false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cakephp.lighthouseapp.com/projects/42648/tickets/2905-tests-fixture-table-ar-not-truncate-when-droptable-false</a></p>

<p>However, I tried turning on $dropTables = true, it didn't work. And also I tried modifying the CakeFixtureManager.php as suggested and it didn't work either.</p>

<p>Does anybody know how to fix this issue?</p>

<p>Basically, all zoomed out, it should show the one ""combined value"" for a year.
If you zoom in and the zoomScale passes a specific threshold, I want to show the ""combined values"" for the individual months, and if you zoom further, it should show the real values for the individual days.</p>

<p>So I thought about creating multiple Custom Views for Years, containing Custom Views for Months, containing Custom Views for Days.
The content size of my scroll view would be huge (e.g. if one day in full zoom is something like 30 - 50px) and the memory usage massive.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1423119/uiview-how-do-i-constrain-scaling-to-one-dimension-only"">then I made my scroll view only scaling the x axis.</a></p>

<p>but I am not sure if this is the best way to implement it, I have a lot of trouble with proper sizing of my UI elements (labels for months, showing borders, etc.), so what would be your approach?</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2389539/how-to-create-an-timeline-on-iphone"">I also thought about doing some shifting with 3 screen-sized views.</a></p>

<p>and again I have no clue how to implement zoom on this method.</p>

<p>would appreciate some fresh thoughts and ideas on how to do this.</p>

<p>As you see there is the last array with empty [User] array, so how can I exclude this empty array (whole [2] array I mean) without using foreach/if blocks? I know that using bindModel will do all as well but this is not for my question ;) So, how?</p>

<p>Imagine this as a queue based platform where the client program (source agents that pulls metadata from a content management system) will send data packets (approxialtely 1KB size) to server and the server will store these packets in its designated file system. </p>

<p>The server will categorize the data packet based on some of the header information from the data packet and should be able to retrieve and return approproiate data package when it is queried using some of the header information.</p>

<p>We can easily perform this with standard DBMS if the metadata are properly defined but in my case the packet header information will change over a period of time and I don't want to redesign my database frequently.</p>

<p>The challenge that I am seeing here is to store the packet files in a file system effeciently (so that it wont affect the file server performance) and also maintain an indexing information that can be used to locate the appropriate packets when requested. </p>

<p>I am thinking about using any non-DBMS open source framework (java based - nosql??) that can serve the above mentioned purpose. The number of packets can range from few hunder thousands to several million based on volume of the source repository.</p>

Well I've tried a bunch of things already and I have ultimately come up short. I think my situation is a bit more complex than how it may seem at first glance so I'll try to provide as much detail as possible below.</p>

<p>There are 3 domains hosted on the same server:
Main domain: <code>example.com</code>
Add on domain: <code>example.com.au</code>
Add on domain: <code>example.com.mx</code></p>

<p>The main domain, <code>https://example.com</code> does have the 301 from <code>https://www.example.com</code> to <code>https://example.com</code> set up correctly. So no problems there. However, the add on domains <code>example.com.au</code> and <code>example.com.mx</code> do not have the 301 redirects set up. Also, for both of these add on domains, the www versions show the following message when you visit their pages:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your connection is not private</p>
  
  <p>Attackers might be trying to steal your information from
  www.example.com.au (for example, passwords, messages, or credit
  cards).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry for being a total noob but not sure if these details are important. But I figure I should provide them anyway just in case.</p>

<p>All the domains are on the same platform - Magento
All the domains share the same document root folder of course sharing the same .htaccess file</p>

<p>I tried a few different things with the htaccess file but unfortunately nothing worked... I also tried doing the redirects in cPanel but nothing happened. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!!</p>

<p><strong>Plan:</strong>  The user fills in a form and the value entered is then evaluated to determine if it is an email address or a UID (user id).  If email, we accept it as long as it passes a fairly simple RegEx.  If it doesn't pass that, then we evaluate the form field to see if it is a valid format for a UID (we do more checks on this later) and if both fail, we send an alert to the user stating that the value entered is not accepted as a valid email or UID.  This is the goal.  It is for internal use only so with aren't trying to throw every possible email test against it and as for UID, the RegEx below has been working for us thus far.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ideally using DI (<a href=""http://www.ninject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ninject</a>) to manage contexts/repositories in scope, but in reality limited to a service-locator pattern, don't ask.  Ideal example:</p>

<pre><code>// EF code-first context
kernel.Bind&lt;MyDbContext&gt;().ToSelf().InRequestScope().WithConstructorArgument(""connectionString"",...);

// EF code-first repositories
kernel.Bind&lt;IRepository&lt;SomeModel&gt;&gt;().To&lt;EfRepository&lt;SomeModel, MyDbContext&gt;&gt;().InRequestScope();
kernel.Bind&lt;IRepository&lt;AuditLog&gt;&gt;().To&lt;EfRepository&lt;AuditLog, MyDbContext&gt;&gt;().InRequestScope();
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In my service call, I attempt to save bad data to the database, so the repo/context <code>.SaveChanges()</code> correctly fails:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    var model = new SomeModel { Name = ..., Blah = ... }
    repoSomeModels.Add(model);
    repoSomeModels.Commit(); // bad data, throws exception
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I then want to log a record of this failed attempt to the same database:</p>

<pre><code>catch(Exception ex) {
    repoAuditLogs.Add(new AuditLog { Action = ..., Result = ex.Message });
    repoAuditLogs.Commit();
    throw ex; // rethrow the problem so we can properly bail
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>But, when attempting to save the changes in the second commit (<code>repoAuditLogs.Commit()</code>) I get the same exception again.  This is because the ""bad data"" from the first attempted commit is still sitting around in the EF Context, even though the attempt failed, and so EF tries again to commit the bad data, not knowing it shouldn't.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How do you remove failed changes from the the EF context?  Or am I going about this wrong?</p>

<p><em>(Update: don't concentrate on the specifics of my scenario, i.e. because I'm effectively logging an error it might be appropriate to use a different context, but let's say I just want to do something else)</em></p>

<h2>Possible Solutions</h2>

<p>I came across this blog post -- <a href=""http://rundevrun.blogspot.com/2012/06/entity-framework-removing-failed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rundevrun.blogspot.com/2012/06/entity-framework-removing-failed.html</a> -- which says you should find all the problem entities and mark their changes as ""accepted"", which results in EF ""ignoring"" them during subsequent commits.  This works in my case, allowing me to save my audit log and ""quit"".</p>

<p>However, a colleague pointed out that this results in a context no longer correctly in sync with the data it represents, and thus is a terrible idea -- even though it's ""okay"" for my case (because I'm immediately stopping the program) if you were to continue the request (as suggested by the original post) you would run the risk of attempting to use a ""corrupted"" context, and you could get unintended side effects.</p>

<p>In another scenario to resolve deadlocks, he explicit wrapped the commit in a (code-based) transaction (EF already does this in SQL) so he could reattempt it, but this doesn't address my problem where the <em>data</em> is bad, not the <em>connection</em>.</p>

<p>The only other solution I can think of is to save my audits in a new context.  Ideally, I use DI/locator to map my audit repo to a different context, something like (emphasis <code>new MyDbContext</code> or whatever it should be):</p>

<pre><code>    kernel.Bind&lt;IRepository&lt;AuditLog&gt;&gt;().To&lt;EfRepository&lt;AuditLog, MyDbContext&gt;&gt;(new MyDbContext(...)).InRequestScope();
</code></pre>

<p>but then I have two contexts floating around, which seems contrary to the point of sharing a context in the first place.</p>

<p>Because of the order of library linking the result is always the same:</p>

sys.version_info(major=2, minor=7, micro=9, releaselevel='final', serial=0)
('Today is', 'Thu Jun  4 10:59:29 2015')
</code></pre>

<p>Since the names are the same it looks like the linker resolves everything with the Python 2 interpreter. Is there some way to isolate the names or to encourage the linker to be lazier in resolving them? If possible, it'd be ideal to get the linker to confirm that all names can be resolved and but put off symbol resolution until the appropriate linker can be chosen.</p>

<p>A highly related question asks about running two independent embedded interpreters at the same time:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2968317/multiple-independent-embedded-python-interpreters-on-multiple-operating-system-t"">Multiple independent embedded Python Interpreters on multiple operating system threads invoked from C/C++ program</a></p>

<p>The suggestion there is to use two separate processes but I suspect there's a simpler answer to this question.</p>

<p>The reason behind the question is that I thought I understood from a conversation with someone way back when that there was a program that did this. And now I'm just curious about how it would be done.</p>

<p>2.) Does it make any sense to peform a kmeans clustering with the three columns <strong>(X1,X2,X1/X2)</strong>  instead of <strong>(X1,X2)</strong>? </p>

<p>For my understanding there is a nonlinear term added that does not contain any new information. In the k-means clustering such a variable can actually only hurt the results. Am I wrong? </p>

<p>EDIT: My thoughts are, if you have two points in the plane (a,b) and (c,d) their euclidean distance is </p>

<pre><code>sqrt((a-c)^+(b-d)^2). 
</code></pre>

<p>If you add the ratio of the two values you get two triples (a,b,a/b) and (c,d,c/d) with the distance</p>

<pre><code>sqrt((a-c)^+(b-d)^2+(a/b-c/d)^2)
</code></pre>

<p>The effects on a kmeans clustering are substantia. Here is a sample R code for a 2 dimensional example: </p>

<pre><code>set.seed(1)
x &lt;- rbind(matrix(rnorm(100, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2),matrix(rnorm(100, mean =      1, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2))
colnames(x) &lt;- c(""x"", ""y"")
cl1 &lt;- kmeans(x, 2,nstart=30)
plot(x, col = cl1$cluster)
points(cl1$centers, col = 1:2, pch = 8, cex = 2)
</code></pre>

<p>![Kmeans Clustering with the variables <strong>(X1,X2)</strong>][1]</p>

<p>When the nonlinear variables are introduced the results for the variables look like this: </p>

<pre><code>set.seed(1)
x &lt;- rbind(matrix(rnorm(100, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2),matrix(rnorm(100, mean =     1, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2))

#add nonlinear term

<p>OAuth protects a REST API on my server and I have a mobile app consuming it.</p>

<p>In my mobile app, I have some functionalities (endpoints) that can be accessible even before the end-user logins to their private account.<br>
Some user may even just want to use the public functionalities without creating an account.</p>

<p>I would like to protect with OAuth both ""public"" and ""private-to-the-user"" endpoints.</p>

<p>Therefore I think the way to go is to use OAuth the following way (but I may be wrong...very wrong).</p>

<p>The mobile app will first do 2-legged authentication as soon as the app is launched the first time. That way the mobile app will get a ""2-legged"" token.  The mobile app will use this token to access public endpoints.</p>

<p>When (and if) the user requests to login to the application, the mobile app will do a 3-legged authentication and will get a ""3-legged token"". From now on, the app will forget about the previous 2-legged token and use the 3-legged token 
to access both public and private endpoints.</p>

<p>1) First question. Does that make sense? Is there another good way to do that?</p>

<p>Now my problem is: how can I (the server provider) know whether the mobile app wants to authenticate using 2-legged? I guess, as the provider, I need to know that in order to decide whether I will redirect the client to the login 
form for the user to fill (in the case of 3-legged) or I will just issue an already-authorised request token (in the case of 2-legged) so that that can be exchanged for an access token (as for the 3-legged).  </p>

<p>My idea for doing that was to provide the client with 2 consumer keys: one to use when they want 2-legged and one to use when they want 3-legged. Me, as a provider, I will know which flow to provide based on the consumer key I receive.</p>

<p>2) Second (and last question). Is this sensible? Is there a better way to implement it?</p>

<p>I have seen people implementing 2-legged by just allowing the client (consumer) to send an empty access token. Is that the way, instead?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>This looks pretty good but the issue is I'm stuck on a very old defunct PHP4 based network drive to run my script.</p>

<p>I had wondered about having a file to send the commands to and the worker read from the top of that file list.. but I'm not sure how I would do this and if I'll get issues with the file being open by the queue or worker at the same time.</p>

<p>I'm in charge of updating an online resource guide for employees at my office. My work uses a proprietary web software called InQuira Info Manager for people to search the repository for answers. Basically it works like WordPress. It's a web-based WSYIWYG web editor, but you can add source code manually as well.</p>

<p>At work, I use Dreamweaver CS2 [upgrading is not a current option] and all our machines have IE7—I have no idea for how much longer. So, whatever I build has to be compatible with IE7 and cannot be a data-driven site, such as using PHP or other server-side technologies. I can, however, use JavaScript, whether referenced externally or inline.</p>

<p>The pages used for the reference guide are a two-colum format, with a left sidebar <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> for navigation and a right main <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to display the content. I pulled the source code for a Spry vertical flyout menu from my copy of Dreamweaver CS6 at home and pasted it into my CS2 pages at work, inside a ""#nav"" <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> within the sidebar <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Here's the problem: I need to be able to have the source HTML for the Spry menu file loaded into the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, rather than pasted in many different instances across multiple pages. As this is a resource guide, it will be regularly updated, so if I add or remove a topic, I don't want to have to do so twenty times, once for each topic. Template layouts will not work either, since I can't just hit the ""re-publish"" button in Dreamweaver—with Info Manager, I have to copy the entire HTML file's source code and manually paste it into the Info Manager file, sort of like creating a new WordPress entry.</p>

<p>I have tried using an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> with no end of trouble; specifically, at least in IE7 <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tags do not appear to respect the z-Index property and so no matter what, the flyout menus fall behind the content <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. No matter what I do, I can't get them on top of the content . I have read about using JavaScript to use the <code>.innerHTML</code> property to load the content into the ""#nav"" <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> but I must be doing something wrong. I paste the script code within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> area and call the script within the HTML file, but can't get it to work.</p>

<p>I will admit that I'm certainly no pro when it comes to web design, but everything was going great until I hit this wall. IE7 sucks but I can't compel my work to upgrade. Any workaround ideas using JavaScript or other non-server-side alternatives would be great. Thank you!</p>

We started with React and Flux (Facebook implementation), but recently switched to Reflux for the Flux implementation. While the Fb Flux implementation knows the concept of 'named' store events, this concept is not available in Reflux. As a result, every component that listens to a store always reacts on all events. Below there is reference image that displays the complexity of our user interface.</p>

<p>As you can see we have a lot of repeating components (multiple tabs with the same sort of info, multiple components with customer details and multiple reapeating lists (even nested) with details.</p>

<p>This application is a new front-end (UI) for an existing .Net application that maintains all te data (opened invoices etc.). The web application can communicate with this back-end by use of web services (MVC web API 2).</p>

<p>Given the user interface as shown in the picture, I would like to know whether I could better go for a store per invoice that holds all the invoice data (with an aggregated store that references them all), or for a store per invoice that holds only the invoice header info and some other stores that hold the information for each of the detail panes.</p>

<p>So the sql works fine for normal queries like

<p>Where test is the keyspace and kv is the table name</p>

<p>Now the Datastax supported <a href=""http://docs.datastax.com/en/datastax_enterprise/4.6/datastax_enterprise/spark/sparkSqlSupportedSyntax.html"" rel=""nofollow"">spark sql syntax docs</a> show there is an operation for caching a table in memory like this</p>

<p><code>CACHE TABLE kv</code></p>

<p>The problem is that this doesn't tell spark the Keyspace that kv is in. When I try doing</p>

<p><code>CACHE TABLE test.kv</code> I get an error because <code>.</code> isn't supported in the <code>CACHE TABLE</code> statement (you can see this in the docs I linked above).</p>

<p>For example, I have a button on my view that changes one parameter of the model, and another button that changes another parameter.  If either one changes, I need to update the volume.  Would the best way to do this be: 1) Call the model's UpdateVolume method in each seperate ""ButtonPressed"" method in my ViewController OR to have the model do Key Value Observing on itself and whenever any of it parameters change, call UpdateVolume?  The later seems more convenient if I implement more parameters, each updated by the ViewController w/ a different method.</p>

The effect I want is that when you press the first button panel with answers opens when you press the second closes the first and the second is opened so on. It now works fine, the problem is when you start to press randomly, control no animation finishes executing, and that means it does not close the open panel but if you move the positions of the other toggle button and overlap. Looking at the code, I could see that fails to execute the animation, do not understand the reason for not it throws any errors, simply does not work well.</p>

This is based on version 1.3 of the tool.</p>

<p>The installation procedure as <a href=""http://brat.nlplab.org/installation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documented</a> includes the steps below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unpack the .tar.gz file in an (Apache) web server directory, typically <code>/var/www/html</code> or <code>$HOME/public_html</code></li>
<li>Possibly rename the unpacked directory from <code>brat-v1.3_Crunchy_Frog</code> to something simple such as <code>brat</code></li>
<li>Enter the directory and run <code>sudo ./install.sh</code></li>
<li>Start the web server (<code>sudo service httpd start</code>) if it wasn't running already</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> When following this procedure, any attempt to use brat in a browser (by directing it to <code>http://localhost/brat/index.xhtml</code> fails with the following error messages displayed on screen:</p>

Unfortunately, the <code>""postgres""</code> user doesn't have file writing privileges on my local file system, so when I try to do certain things like add model objects to the database that have an image field, I'm blocked.

I've had great luck with .rst -> .odt -> .docx using rst2odt.py (<code>docutils</code>) and LibreOffice. I noticed that Sphinx can generate ""Docutils XML"". In my mind, I should be able to use that and then go to .odt through the same mechanism as rst2odt.py does. However, I'm not sure how I would go about that. I realize that there is a package <code>sphinxcontrib-docxbuilder</code>, but it uses <code>python-docx</code> internally which has rather limited table support based on my experiments. I am using rst specifically because of the ability to do column/row spanning in a very clean way.</p>

<p>The alternative that I'm currently considering is to use something like <code>jinja2</code> to do all the stuff I would need Sphinx for and stick stick with rst2odt.py.</p>

<p>I'd like to make a polar plot using the data above.  The 'header' (row names) are across the top 30,60,90,etc with the ranges down the first column (100,200,300,etc..) with the intensities being the values of the distance direction combinations, for example 100m @ 30deg = 131 observations. </p>

<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I have a client and a server.</p>

<p>The client sending request to the server using the call.invoke method.
The call for now is synchronous and waiting for the answer.</p>

<p>The time is taking to receive the replay from the server under load is around 1 sec(this is a lot of time).</p>

<p>at the client side we are generating requests around 50-100 request per second , the queue is exploding.</p>

<p>For now i just created a thread pool that will work asynchronous and will send the requests to the server per thread , but the request it self will be synchronous. </p>

<p>The meaning of that is that the thread pool should maintain ~100 threads if we do want that it will work fine.</p>

<p>I'm not sure this is the best solution.</p>

<p>I also was thinking to create somehow 1 thread that will send the requests and 1 thread that will catch the replays, but then i'm afraid that i will pass on the load to the server side. </p>

<p>Few things that are importent:</p>

<p>We cannot effect the code on the server side and we cannot control the time it takes to receive a replay.       </p>

<p>while receiving the replay we just use this data to create another data structure and pass it on - so the time stamp is not relay importent.</p>

<p>we are using axis api.</p>

<p>any idea of how is it the best way to solve it? the thread pool of the 100 thread seems fine ? or there some other ways?</p>

<p>Thanks! </p>

<p>However after watching the following video <a href=""http://vimeo.com/68375232/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Ian Cooper: TDD, where did it all go wrong"">Ian Cooper: TDD, where did it all go wrong</a> and doing some more reading, I'm starting to think that my tests are too closely tied to the implementation of the code. For instance, the behavior I'm trying to test in the first instance is that if we try to login with an invalid request we response with the http status code of bad request. The issue is that I'm testing this by stubbing the <code>IValidate</code> dependency. If the implementer decides the <code>IValidate</code> abstraction is no longer useful and decides to validate the request inline in the <code>Login</code> method, then the <strong>behaviour</strong> of the system hasn't changed however my tests now break.</p>

<p>But then, the only other alternate is an integration test where I launch the web server and hit the login endpoint and assert on the response. The issue is that this is brittle and complicated, as we would ultimately need to have a valid user in the third party credential store for testing the user login successful scenario.</p>

<p>So my question is, is my understanding incorrect, or is there a middle ground between testing against the implementation and full-blown integration testing?</p>

I represent obstacles in the world with static bodies. Whenever a dynamic body (i.e. a game character) collides with one of these obstacles, there is a very noticeable drop in performance.

"3790487","1","3792411","","2010-09-24 19:52:44","","2","8308","<p>I have written a JAXB mapping that stored a sublist inside a root element in a <code>LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;</code> instead of a <code>Collection&lt;Object&gt;</code> maintained through a specific <code>XmlJavaTypeAdapter</code>. Hereunder a sample:</p>

<pre>@XmlRootElement
public class Parent {
    @XmlJavaTypeAdapter(ListToMapAdapter.class)
    @XmlElement
    private LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Child&gt; children;

    ...
}</pre>

<p>The key is built from the attributes of the child tag (e.g. <code>&lt;child id=""key""&gt;</code> give a <code>Map.Entry&lt;String, Child&gt;</code> like <code>{key =&gt; child}</code>.</p>

<p>One of my coworker says its bad designed, and that this <code>Map</code> should be in the object in charge of unmarshalling the XML. I'm not agree with him. Here are some pros and cons on such an approach. Which design do you think is the best? And which pros and cons did you see to complete the debate?</p>

<p><strong>Goal of this design:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>Map</code> give the ability to search efficiently children with a criteria (the key in my sample) instead of search by iteration on a Collecion.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>responsability for searching and filtering the sublist is at the nearest of the object and the parent object is responsible of retrieving and filtering its child,</li>
<li>the building of the <code>Map</code> is automatically made by JAXB when unmarshalling: elegant, efficient, and <strong>preserve from building the <code>Map</code> with a post process of the list after umarshalling (iteration)</strong>,</li>
<li>the same object in different readers has still the ability of filtering its children,</li>
<li>subjective, it's really a pretty way of doing that :),</li>
<li>if <code>@XmlJavaTypeAdapter</code> exists, it's partly for this (numerous samples of this on the Web).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong> (some are from my coworker)<strong>:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>JAXB limitation constraints to code to a concrete implementation instead of an interface: could not declare <code>Map&lt;String, Child&gt;</code> in my sample (not instantiable by JAXB while unmarshalling),</li>
<li>maybe (and its the argument of my coworker), its not the role of a mapping object (simple POJO according to him) to have such a behavior,</li>
<li><code>@XmlJavaTypeAdapter</code> aims only at converting simple object to specific types: <code>xs:date</code> to Joda time <code>Calendar</code> for instance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks in advance for your 2 cents.</p>

I am using <a href=""http://www.mailgun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mailgun</a> and custom SMTP settings for most users. Most emails sent through <code>outbound_mailer.rb</code> use custom smtp_settings through <code>delivery_method_options</code>. The rest use the default settings from <code>production.rb</code>.</p>

<p>The issue I am having is, the <code>action_mailer.smtp_settings</code> aren't always resetting to the default set in <code>production.rb</code>. So, when I am sending mail from <code>notifications_mailer.rb</code>, sometimes the <code>action_mailer.smtp_settings</code> will use a random user's custom SMTP settings. This means Mailgun will receive the information for a random mail server and will send using that information. Resulting in the email's ""from"" to be different from the mail server and often this causes emails to go to spam or not be received at all.</p>

<p>Eg. (from: john.smith@test.com via example.com)</p>

<li>I use <a href=""https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job"" rel=""nofollow"">DelayedJob</a></li>
<li>Assume lots of emails are being sent all the time (0 to 10000)</li>

It looks like the only way to make it happen is through the Macro Recorder, which I have unfortunately never used (as it looks quite powerful!).</p>

<p>The straightforward way to make my macro would be to start the recorder with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>, then go to Debug -> Exceptions, check all of the boxes I want, click OK, and then stop the recorder.  Unfortunately, all that I can see is that it opens the Exceptions window, and no more than that.</p>

<p>I figured that if the Macro Recorder doesn't record mouse events, then surely it must record keyboard events, but I was wrong about that, too.  Upon editing my TemporaryMacro, I saw that the only thing it does is</p>

<pre><code>DTE.ExecuteCommand(""Debug.Exceptions"")
</code></pre>

<p>What I really want to do is add a method that can enter keystrokes like <kbd>DOWN</kbd>, <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>, and <kbd>ENTER</kbd>.</p>

<p>I have googled like crazy, gone through MSDN, and checked here on SO.  I am embarrassed to say that I have been unable to find any information about an object in DTE that allows me to send keystrokes!  Hopefully, someone here will know how to do it!</p>

<p>This is the closest thing I've found to a document regarding keystroke automation: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8h31zbch.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8h31zbch.aspx</a></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I figured it out how to send keystrokes, but <strong>how can you send them to popup dialogs???</strong></p>

<p>Here's the code I tried:</p>

<pre><code>Public Module RecordingModule
    Sub TemporaryMacro()
        DTE.ExecuteCommand(""Debug.Exceptions"")
        System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.SendWait(""+{TAB}"")
        System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.SendWait(""{DOWN}"")
        System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.SendWait(""%T"")
        System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.SendWait(""{ENTER}"")
    End Sub
End Module
</code></pre>

<p>I couldn't get it to work, so I tried debugging, and that's when I realized what was happening -- <code>SendWait</code> doesn't get called until after the dialog is dismissed.  </p>

<p>So does anyone know how to use the Macro Recorder to interact with popup dialogs via keyboard commands?</p>

<p>I successfully created stubs with Apache Axis2 and tested them with SoapUI. Now it's time to implement security. <a href=""https://edwin.eurodw.eu/edservices/2.2/PerformanceDataUploadService.svc?wsdl"" rel=""nofollow"">This is</a> one of the services I must integrate. It ships a WS-Security policy so that I must trasmit my credentials properly.</p>

<p>I want to integrate Apache Rampart into my project. I have found lots of difficulties downloading the required JARs and MAR file to use, but I made it.</p>

<p>Now I have the following project structure:</p>

<pre><code>webapp
   -- WEB-INF
       -- classes
       -- conf
          -- axis2.xml
       -- modules
          -- several -mar files
          -- rampart-1.6.2.mar
          -- modules.list
       -- spring
          -- various context files
       -- web.xml
</code></pre>

<p>I use Spring to initialize all beans, including web service stubs. If I let Spring instantiate them normally, they work as expected. But when I use a <code>BeanPostProcessor</code> to engage the rampart module it will fail</p>

<pre><code>Caused by: org.apache.axis2.AxisFault: Unable to engage module : rampart
at org.apache.axis2.client.ServiceClient.engageModule(ServiceClient.java:363)
at it.csttech.edwin.security.SecurityHandler.engage(SecurityHandler.java:52)
</code></pre>

<p>In my axis2.xml I have added <code>&lt;module ref=""rampart"" /&gt;</code> after <code>addressing</code></p>

<p>I enable Rampart with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>    RampartConfig rc = new RampartConfig();
    rc.setUser(user);
    Policy policy = PolicyEngine.getPolicy(new StAXOMBuilder(policyStream).getDocumentElement()); //XML policy file in classpath
    policy.addAssertion(rc);
    serviceClient.engageModule(""rampart""); //this fails
    Options options = serviceClient.getOptions();
    options.setProperty(WSHandlerConstants.PW_CALLBACK_REF, callbackHandler); //This will provide password
    options.setProperty(RampartMessageData.KEY_RAMPART_POLICY, policy); //This will provide policy
</code></pre>

<p>I discovered that if I do <code>Map&lt;String, AxisModule&gt; modules = serviceClient.getAxisConfiguration().getModules();</code> I just get an empty map!!!!</p>

<p>So no modules are loaded at all.</p>

<p>Then I tried to move the modules/ directory to another place on my hard drive, and link it via system property <code>axis2.repo</code> but even if Axis2 won't load if I willignly set a bad path, it just won't load the <code>rampart-1.6.2.mar</code> file and the map will be still empty.</p>

<p>I'm getting crazy. I don't know how to properly load Rampart into my setup. I don't even know if Spring IoC can be used to inject a proper configuration and/or engage Rampart in all services.</p>

     event.preventDefault()
     return false
   )

<p>This script invokes via $.ajax the following action: </p>

<pre><code>def create

    format.json{

         @cart.save ?

               ( render json: { error: t(""line_items.error"") } )

       }

<p>That calculates the number of items in a cart, and returns json-result. <strong>This works fine within browser, but doesn't with cucumber test:</strong> </p>

<pre><code>@javascript
Scenario: Add a product to a cart via ajax control
  And I follow ""Cucumbers""
  When I follow ""Add To Cart""
  And I wait for the ajax request to finish

      expected there to be content ""1 item in your cart"" in [...]
      <strong>0 item in your cart\n View Your Cart [...]</strong><br>
     (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)</p>

<p>The step ""And I wait for the ajax request to finish"" is: </p>

<pre><code>When(/^I wait for the ajax request to finish$/) do
    start_time = Time.now
    page.evaluate_script( 'jQuery.isReady&amp;&amp;jQuery.active==0' ).
      class.should_not eql(String)

<p><strong>What choices do people make when deciding on their architecture for a new project?</strong></p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>This question could serve as a decent reference point for links/ideas/suggestions/architecture decisions, anything really that is of interest when deciding the best way to approach a new solution.</p>

<p>I am currently working on an ASP.NET MVC application - mainly as a exercise to increase my experience of the new framework - that works with an ExtJs front end passing Json objects between the layers.</p>

<p>Testability is very important so my .NET layer uses interfaces to define contracts and consists of a service layer, which handles data validation and application logic, which in turn interacts with a repository layer that just handles the data persistence and retrieval. All allowing me to test quite thoroughly.</p>

<p>I have a custom model hierarchy that is based on the database, however, it is not related to any ORM (I am using LinqToSql at present) tool tying it to a particular platform. My repositories return my custom models and not their own database structures, which will hopefully allow me to develop different repository implementations in the future without too many problems.</p>

<p>Another reason for this approach was that I am working with a legacy database that has some interesting design choices and cannot change the structure too much at present, so I wanted a bit more control over the resultant models.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>All this may seem completely wrong to some of you so tell me what you think ;)</p>

<p>I've four tabs in Main tabbar controller. On 1st Tab, there is ""Dashboard"" Page which is displayed when User registered with Device-ID.</p>

<p>For non-existing Users, It'll prompt a message for Registration. And By clicking on ""OK"" button, I want to jump on 4th Tab which is used for Set-Up module.</p>

<p>So, how can I set Tabbar index as done with older earlier versions and navigation in Tabbar ?</p>

<p>Please tell me any Solution.</p>

<p>Thanks in Advance.</p>

<p>The headers are pulled in from attributes set up in magento's admin panel, and unfortunately it doesn't assign classes to them, I am trying to put the attribute code in the id.</p>

<p>This is the code that pulls in the filters:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php if($this-&gt;canShowBlock()): ?&gt;
&lt;div class=""block block-layered-nav""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""block-title""&gt;

            &lt;dl id=""narrow-by-list""&gt;
                &lt;?php $_filters = $this-&gt;getFilters() ?&gt;
                &lt;?php foreach ($_filters as $_filter): ?&gt;
                &lt;?php if($_filter-&gt;getItemsCount()): ?&gt;
                    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;__($_filter-&gt;getName()) ?&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
                    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;?php echo $_filter-&gt;getHtml() ?&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
                &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
                &lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;

<p>I would like to add the id to the dt in this line:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dt&gt;&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;__($_filter-&gt;getName()) ?&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dt id=""filter&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;__($_filter-&gt;getAttributeCode()) ?&gt;""&gt;&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;__($_filter-&gt;getName()) ?&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But it just outputs nothing where the code should be.</p>

<p>So my main problem stemmed from the fact that HtmlAgiltyPack won't get child nodes from a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element by default. See <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/2385840"">How to get all input elements in a form with HtmlAgilityPack</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The problem is, that link shows how to fix the issue in C#, but I need to fix it in PowerShell. Any ideas?</p>

<p>====================<br>
I'll simplify my HTML</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;form name=""aspnetForm"" method=""post"" action=""default.aspx"" id=""aspnetForm""&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""testname1"" id=""testname1"" value=""testvalue1"" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""anothertest"" id=""anothertest"" value=""12345"" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I see that when I select the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element, I don't get any children back, hence why I couldn't select the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements.</p>

<pre class=""lang-powershell prettyprint-override""><code>Add-Type -Path ""C:\Program Files (x86)\HtmlAgilityPack\HtmlAgilityPack.dll""
$HTMLDocument = New-Object HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlDocument
$HTMLDocument.Load(""C:\users\smithj\Desktop\test2.html"")
$inputNodes=$HTMLDocument.DocumentNode.SelectNodes(""//form"")
$inputNodes

Attributes           : {name, method, action, id}
ChildNodes           : {}
Closed               : True
ClosingAttributes    : {}
FirstChild           :
HasAttributes        : True
HasChildNodes        : False
HasClosingAttributes : False
Id                   : aspnetForm
InnerHtml            :
InnerText            :
LastChild            :

NextSibling          : HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlTextNode
NodeType             : Element
OriginalName         : form
OuterHtml            : &lt;form name=""aspnetForm"" method=""post"" action=""default.aspx"" id=""aspnetForm""&gt;
OwnerDocument        : HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlDocument
ParentNode           : HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlNode
PreviousSibling      :
StreamPosition       : 0
XPath                : /form[1]
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that <code>HasChildNodes</code> is equal to false.</p>

<p>From the C# link I provided, I somehow need to run <code>HtmlNode.ElementsFlags.Remove(""form"");</code> but I can't figure out what to type into PowerShell that would be equivalent.</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>:
Thanks to <em>har07</em> for pointing me in the right direction. <code>[HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlNode]::ElementsFlags.Remove(""form"")</code> was what I needed to run. </p>

<li>So, alternative to this, ""developer.android.com"" suggested to use
<code>Notification.Builder</code>.</li>
<li>But, the class <code>Notification.Builder</code> has methods that were included 
in API level 11 (and thus showed errors in the lines <code>""Call requires API level 11 or more""</code>).</li>
<li>So, it didn't allow me to run the project.</li>
<li>After more googling, gave me the solution to use class
<code>NotificationCompat.Builder</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, reached the stage where no errors were found, and I ran my project on my Sony Xperia Tipo Dual ST21i2... </p>

<p>Tragic ending: I get the following error log:</p>

<pre><code>class Job &lt; ActiveRecord::Base

<p>client.rb</p>

<pre><code>class Client &lt; ActiveRecord::Base

<p>My form for creating a new job looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= simple_form_for :job do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.input :name %&gt;
  &lt;%= &lt;%= collection_select(:job, :client_ids, Client.all, :id, :name, {:include_blank =&gt; 'None'}, { :multiple =&gt; true }) %&gt;%&gt;
  &lt;%= f.button :submit %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

<p>So as you can see there is a drop down box on the form which contains all of the clients.</p>

<p>When you tag your custom views with IBInspectable properties, those properties show up in the Attributes Inspector in IB. </p>

<p>Likewise, when you tag a custom UIView subclass with IBDesignable, Xcode compiles your views and invokes the code to render your view objects right in the Xcode window so you can see what they look like.</p>

<p>The technique for adding IBDesignable and IBInspectable attributes to custom views is pretty much identical in Swift and Objective-C. IBInspectable properties appear in the Interface Builder Attributes Inspector regardless of which language you use to define them.</p>

<p>I've created a category of UIView in Objective-C and an extension of UIView in Swift that promote the borderWidth, cornerRadius, borderColor, and layerBackgroundColor properties of the view's underlying layer as properties of the view. If you change the property, the extension/category does type conversion as required and forwards the change to the layer. </p>

<p>The IBInspectable part works great. I see and can set the new properties in the IB attributes inspector.</p>

<p>I could have sworn that last week, the IBDesignable attribute on my view category/extension was working too, and I could see my custom UIView category rendering in IB with it's changed layer attributes. This week it isn't working.</p>

<p>Was I hallucinating? </p>

<p>Can categories/extensions of existing system classes draw their custom UI in Interface Builder when they are set up with IBDesignable?</p>

It is actually very simple and maybe trivial for some experienced programmers.</p>

<p>Lets say we have a function/method that does some process (call it business logic) by calling other functions which are dealing with specific sub-problems.</p>

<pre><code>function doProcess(){
subProcessA();
subProcessB();
subProcessC();

return ""OK""
}
</code></pre>

<p>But then, we get task to do similar process but this new process must not call subProcessA.
So for example we have next part of code:</p>

<pre><code>function doProcess2(){
subProcessB();
subProcessC();

return ""OK""
}
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is how to design code or should I:</p>

<p>A) Make every time new function for new process like in upper example but then I have lots of redundant code and repeating myself every time.</p>

<p>B) Do big IF in process code like this one: </p>

<pre><code>if(some-condition){
    subProcessA()
 }
</code></pre>

<p>But then my code will look very bad.</p>

<p>C) Migrate that IF directly in subprocessA :</p>

<pre><code>if(!some-condition){
     return // do nothing
} 
</code></pre>

<p>but again it looks like coupled code and also I have a feeling that it is not best approach.</p>

<p>D) Something else?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

And here am I with my custom transport (if you're interested - <a href=""http://named-data.net"" rel=""nofollow"">[2]</a>) would like to use it for RTC communication. Briefly, I need to ""substitute"" the transport layer of WebRTC engine by my custom transport while providing the same RTCPeerConnection-like JavaScript interface for the user. And preferably, it should not look like custom build of Firefox (no patches).
So I've come up with the idea of extension, which will be written in C++ (since it need to be linked with WebRTC library and my custom transport library) and somehow will expose its interface to Javascript. And I've found XPCOM which, as I thought, can provide me this. 
So I've started to fight with out-dated and sparsed info on this topic and after 3 days of struggling finally ended up with builded add-on. Unfortunately, I can't access it from Javascript, because of Javascript's ""Components.classes is undefined"" error. And it seems that there is no way to access it at all. Or I'm wrong on that?</p>

<p>Here is Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>function check()
{
console.debug(""checking..."");   

const {Cc,Ci,Cu} = require(""chrome"");
var rtc = Components.classes[""@named-data.net/ndnrtc;1""].createInstance();
rtc = rtc.QueryInterface(Ci.ndINrtc);   

console.debug(""rtc: ""+rtc);
}
</code></pre>

<p>My component is <strong>visible with XPCOM Viewer</strong> addon and the code above I <strong>can execute</strong> in the console while <strong>empty page</strong> is open in Firefox.</p>

<p>Given all that, I would like to ask Firefox experts regarding possible approaches which I can take in order to implement my idea.

<p>Employee table:  </p>

<pre><code>EmployeeID  
Name

<p>etc.  </p>

<p>Project table:  </p>

<pre><code>ProjectID  
EmployeeID  
ProjectDescription
</code></pre>

<p>Each Employee can manage zero or more projects.</p>

<p>I know how to use the <code>DataSet</code> Designer to add the Employee table as details (multiple bound controls) on <code>Form1</code> (<strong>Windows Form Application</strong>):</p>

<p>Dragging the Company database's Employee table (as details) to form creates the following components:<br>
• CompanyDataSet<br>
• employeeBindingSource<br>
• employeeTableAdapter<br>
• tableAdapterManager<br>
• employeeBindingNavigator  </p>

<p>1) How do you add a ListBox to Form1 that displays the ProjectDescription of all the projects the currently displayed Employee manages?  What ListBox properties need to be set?</p>

<p>I believe I will need the following query:  </p>

<pre><code>SELECT Project.ProjectDescription  
FROM  Project RIGHT JOIN Employee ON Project.EmployeeID = Employee.EmployeeID  
WHERE EmployeeID = ?  
</code></pre>

<p>Parameter would be the employeeIDtextbox.Text  </p>

<p>2) Project records will be created programmatically (OleDbConnection, OleDbCommand) from Form2.  What statement is required to update Form1 when it is displayed?</p>

<p>I have searched the web and read pages and pages of Microsoft documentation and have hit a wall...</p>

<p>We were given a functionality to test for uploading images for a selected car. There was only a <code>Browse</code> button, and an <code>Upload</code> button in the page.</p>

<p>We had to test if the image name is getting saved in the format     </p>

<pre><code>(make year-car make-car model-car version-unique ID.jpg)
</code></pre>

<p>We tested it for a number of different cars and functionality was working fine.</p>

<p>But, we missed out one thing. </p>

<p>There was a stored procedure created for saving these image URLs to the database (it was not shared with us. We normally do black box testing.)</p>

<p>Database column being used to save was of size 100 characters, but the stored procedure was storing image URLs in a variable of length 50 characters</p>

<p>Now, the Image names and URLs were getting saved properly for most cars. </p>

<p>But, for cars where Image URLs got greater than 50 chars in length, data got truncated while saving in the database.</p>

<p>This resulted in a major issue in production, and I was left baffled by how I could have caught this earlier. </p>

<p>Was this a bug that could have been caught by black box testing, or this is the kind of bug you learn to check by experience?</p>

"32299249","1","","","2015-08-30 17:21:18","","0","37","<p>I am trying to use public factory methods in place of public constructors with Dagger2. But  think I am missing some connection in using Dagger2.</p>

<p>When I use public constructors, my example interfaces / classes are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>interface InterfaceA {
    void foo();
}

class A implements InterfaceA {

    @Inject public A() {}

    @Override
    public void foo() {
        System.out.println(""foo"");
    }
}

interface InterfaceB {
    void bar();
}

class B implements InterfaceB {

    private final InterfaceA depA;

    @Inject public B(InterfaceA depInstance) {
        depA = depInstance;
    }

    @Override
    public void bar() {
        System.out.println(""bar"");
        depA.foo();
    }
}

@Module class MyModule {

    @Provides InterfaceA provideA(final Provider&lt;A&gt; provider) {
        return A.create(provider);
    }

    @Provides InterfaceB provideB(B bInstance) {
        return bInstance;
    }
}

@Component(modules=MyModule.class)
interface MyComponent {
    InterfaceA provideInterfaceA();
    InterfaceB provideInterfaceB();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Usage for the above:</p>

<pre><code>public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyComponent comp = DaggerMyComponent.create();
        InterfaceA a = comp.provideInterfaceA();
        a.foo();
        InterfaceB b = comp.provideInterfaceB();
        b.bar();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, If I rewrite the classes A and B as follows:</p>

<pre><code>class A implements InterfaceA {

    public static A create() {
        return new A();
    }

    private A() {}

    @Override
    public void foo() {
        System.out.println(""foo"");
    }
}

class B implements InterfaceB {

    public static B create(InterfaceA depA) {
        return new B(depA);
    }

    private final InterfaceA depA;

    private B(InterfaceA depInstance) {
        depA = depInstance;
    }

    @Override
    public void bar() {
        System.out.println(""bar"");
        depA.foo();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am able to re-write MyModule class as:</p>

<pre><code>@Module class MyModule {

    @Provides InterfaceA provideA() {
        return A.create();
    }

    @Provides InterfaceB provideB() {
        return B.create(provideA());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this does not use much of the Dagger2 framework. 
Looks like I am not writing my classes to use the Inject and Provides annotations correctly. What am I missing?</p>

                "", hour="" + hour +
                '}';
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My spring xml file <code>alarm2.xml</code> is as follows. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;beans xmlns=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans""
       xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""
       xsi:schemaLocation=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd""&gt;

       &lt;bean id=""propertyRandom"" abstract=""true""&gt;

       &lt;bean id=""alarm1"" class=""com.anshbansal.alarm2.Alarm"" parent=""propertyRandom""&gt;

       &lt;/bean&gt;


&lt;/beans&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There is ambiguity as it is not instantly clear which <code>int</code> will go into volume and which will go into hour. If I print I get the following</p>

<pre><code>Alarm{type='Ringing', volume=23, hour=10}
</code></pre>

<p>So how does spring read the xml file to resolve which constructor to call? Parent first, then bean? Is it documented somewhere?</p>

<p>I know that there are ways like specifying <code>index</code> and <code>name</code> as attributes but I should also be aware about how to deal with such ambiguous conditions. That's why I am asking this.</p>

<p>I had asked a similar question but not directed at using a comparator function when defining the map. The solution to my other question involved using the Boost library and tables. I'd like to keep this fairly simple and use my definition above.</p>

<p>Different options would be to use the sequence value as the key for the parent map, which can be done but I'd like to use that as the last option. Is the order of a map not changeable? I'm new to this type of thinking for C++ as I'm quite new, and it's hard coming from newer languages where something like this is a bit easier.</p>

"11430181","1","11430433","","2012-07-11 10:02:31","","1","694","<p>I have a server-client application in which I can modify both codebases. The client communicates with the server through numerous web services and I share some of the classes defined on the server side through Web Reference system. On the wire the data is sent using XML (SOAP). Also, I save some of the data on the disk using <code>XmlSerializer</code>.</p>

<p>Due to rising performance issues, I want to migrate to a more sophisticated serializer with my eyes on Protocol Buffers and protobuf-net. I currently use protobuf-net v2 (r480, .NET 3.5)</p>

<p>The problem I seem to have is that classes shared through Web Reference system do not retain custom class/member attributes like <code>ProtoContract</code> and <code>ProtoMember</code>.<br>
(But the serializer system does <strong>not</strong> throw the usual <code>System.InvalidOperationException: Type is not expected, and no contract can be inferred</code>, leaving me with an empty stream. Is it because the class generated on the client side is marked as <code>partial</code>?)</p>

<p>Example, server side:</p>

<pre><code>[ProtoContract]
public class CommentStruct
{
    [ProtoMember(1)] public int id;
    [ProtoMember(2)] public DateTime time;
    [ProtoMember(3)] public string comment;
    [ProtoMember(4)] public int session;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Client side (generated code):</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;remarks/&gt;
[System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute(""wsdl"", ""2.0.50727.1432"")]
[System.SerializableAttribute()]
[System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute()]
[System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategoryAttribute(""code"")]
[System.Xml.Serialization.XmlTypeAttribute(Namespace=""http://example.org"")]
public partial class CommentStruct {
    private int idField;
    private System.DateTime timeField;
    private string commentField;
    private int sessionField;

    /// &lt;remarks/&gt;
    public int id {
        get {
            return this.idField;
        }
        set {
            this.idField = value;
        }
    }
    [...]
</code></pre>

<p>I managed to get around this issue using <code>ProtoPartialMember</code> in an extra class file on the client side:</p>

<pre><code>[ProtoContract,
ProtoPartialMember(1, ""id""),
ProtoPartialMember(2, ""time""),
ProtoPartialMember(3, ""comment""),
ProtoPartialMember(4, ""session"")]
public partial class CommentStruct
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>The main concern here is: can I do this in a different way to avoid code duplication?<br>
The other is: will I miss out on some of the protobuf-net goodies like inheritance support?</p>

<p>I have found some information about protobuf-net Visual Studio add-in. But as Marc Gravell has decribed it as an 'afterthought', I am reluctant to use it. Moreover, some of my co-developers are using VS Express editions that do not support add-ins.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:
What I meant as my main duplication concern is having to specify the class members and protobuf-net attributes twice - in a class definition on the server side and in partial class attributes on the client side.</p>

For instance, if I shift a note down an octave, the routine only plays the first half of the sound before cutting off. More intense pitch downshifts result in even less of the sound playing, and while I'm not sure I can confirm this, I suspect that speeding up the audio results in relatively long periods of silence before the sound exits the buffer.</p>

<p>Here's my audio playback routine at the moment. So far, a lot more work has gone into making sure other functions send the right data to this than into extending the functionality of this routine.</p>

<pre><code>function playSound(buffer, pitch, dspEffect, dspValue, volume) {

var source = audioEngine.createBufferSource();  
source.buffer = buffer;
source.playbackRate.value = pitch; 

//Volume adjustment is handled before other DSP effects are added.
var volumeAdjustment = audioEngine.createGain();
source.connect(volumeAdjustment);
//Very basic error trapping in case of bad volume input.
if(volume &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; volume &lt;= 1) { 
    volumeAdjustment.gain.value = volume; 
} else { volumeAdjustment.gain.value = 0.6; }

switch(dspEffect){
    case 'lowpass':
        var createLowPass = audioEngine.createBiquadFilter();
        volumeAdjustment.connect(createLowPass);
        createLowPass.connect(audioEngine.destination);
        createLowPass.type = 'lowpass';
        createLowPass.frequency.value = dspValue;
        break;
    //There are a couple of other optional DSP effects, but so far they all operate in about the same fashion.
}
source.start();
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>My intent is for samples to play back fully no matter how much pitch shifting is applied, and to limit the amount of pitch shifting allowed if necessary. I've found that appending several seconds of silence to a sound works around this issue, but it's cumbersome due to the large amount of sounds I would need to process, and I'd prefer a code-based solution. </p>

<p>EDIT: Of the browsers I can test this in, this only appears to be an issue in Google Chrome. Samples play back fully in Firefox, Internet Explorer does not yet support the Web Audio API, and I do not have ready access to Safari or Opera. This definitely changes the nature of the help I'm looking for.</p>

<p>When I test my website with my mobile, which is a Samsung Galaxy S4 with 1920x1080 pixels my website shows me the mobile version, which is in this case the @media query with a max-width of 767px.</p>

<p>I understand that most things would be too small to read or be seen if my mobile respected exact measures like 12px font size.</p>

<p>So my question is, how do I control which version of my website is shown on high resolution devices, because pixels media queries aren't working in my case.</p>

<p>I can run the specific test cases failing by using <code>Unit sessions window</code><br>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/1xVo8.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
Then by navigating stack trace I can figure out what caused the bug, and sometimes it is test case data that needs changing (mechanism works as expected - tests got out of date).</p>

<p>But when I need to go and edit in <code>GetExtraWifQuestionsTestData</code> some <code>TestCaseData</code> I can't find a way to tell which one is failing exactly.
<strong>How can I pinpoint which of test cases are failing?</strong> Is there any built in mechanism to do this, or some low effort 'hack'. Please when answering the question keep in mind we are talking NOT about this specific case, but how to do this in general when complicated mocking mechanisms are being used, and is not immediately obvious which one is which.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> ATM I am commenting out all the cases and then uncommenting them one by one, however this is not a very efficient way.</p>

<p>Now this works perfect to detect 'w' and <code>'a'</code></p>

<p>How shall I incorporate the feature to have combination: <code>'wa'</code>, using the <code>getch()</code>, not <code>raw_input</code></p>

But what im looking for is basically not copying the ""whole"" site but just pieces of it. The procedure of copying a web page is simple if you doing it manually. 1)Goto the URL. 2)Click on File>Save Page As. 3)make sure you save as ""complete page"". 3 easy steps. How would do this automated? i could use a macro but that just making more work than it has to be. triple the effort....</p>

<p>I could probably create a plug in for Firefox that you put in a list of URLs that you would like to be save on to your machine. But im not very familiar with the API/SDK  I could probably look at the HHTrack Src and kinda savage some parts and put a nice puzzle together. But if i would to do this from scratch what APIs would i need to look at for either in C, C++, or Java? im not looking for a gui. but just a simple program. so what are you thoughts?</p>

<p>if you wondering what im researching. Mathematics, Telecommunications, Programming, Computer Architecture, Magnetism.

Usually 2 separate glms are used for this. One for claim frequency and one for claim severity. To get the final price I would have to multiply coefficient estimates of the 2 models, according to categorization. If both models have the same independent variables with the same levels the problem is trivial. I can just multiply the fitted values of both and it's done. The problem arises when the factors have different levels, a cause of merging them to get better results. Lets say I have factor age for frequency with 3 levels 0-25,25-50,50-110 and for severity with 2 levels 0-25,25-110. I want to combine the fitted values to be multiplied in the following sense:</p>

<pre><code>Frequency      Severity
0-25              0-25
25-50            25-110
50-110          25-110
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, the fitted values should be multiplied only when the categories are in the same range. This should also work for non numeric categorizations. For instance</p>

<pre><code>Frequency       Severity
a                     ab
b                     ab
c                     c
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any function/package in R that would allow me to do that? If not, what other ways exist? 
Currently my only idea is to use custom labels for factor levels and then using string comparisons between them. </p>

When a call comes in and the agent picks it up on a ""real"" phone at their workstation, the application, which lives in the workstation's system tray, gets the number on the remote side of the call, and runs it through a central database to see if the number is known as belonging to one of our client companies or their reps. If so, we display information about who the agent is now talking to (person or client location name, company, title, etc).</p>

<p>I developed a proof of concept that monitors my cubicle's phone, using Julmar's excellent <a href=""http://atapi.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">ATAPI</a> library, and got it working well. However, the agents' phones have a significant difference; they plug into a sidecar module with an additional 14 extensions connected to our 1-800 hunt line.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having now is that I need to know not just when a call is connected, but when it's connected to the single phone I'm monitoring, sitting underneath the workstation on which the application is running. Currently, I can see line state changes on all the 800 lines, but I can't tell which line state changes were the direct result of an action of the phone device I'm monitoring; obviously I can monitor changes in phone state and line state, but if two calls ringing on the 800 block are picked up by two agents at nearly the same time I can't tell which phone got which call.</p>

<p>This information simply has to be available somewhere in the TAPI interface, if possibly not wrapped by ATAPI. Any hints on what I should be looking at, hopefully from someone who's done this before, are appreciated.</p>

Now problem is that when picker view appear then it show selection indicator on first value but that value not show in text field. I want that when user click on text filed then picker view appear and value from picker will show in text field where  selection indicator place. How do that? Suppose i have four value in same order 0,1,2,3. Now when picker view appear then selection indicator is at on '0' value. But to get that value we have to scroll picker view and come back to '0' then it show that value in text field. Why it is occurs? And how get value  automatically?</p>

<p>I have a separator between them.</p>

<p>When I drag the separator to the left or right, I want that to remain as the position of the separator. i.e., I should be able to dynamically resize the left and right divs by dragging.</p>

<p>Here is the code I have:</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsbin.com/witicozi/1/edit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsbin.com/witicozi/1/edit</a></p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

  &lt;div style='height: 100px'&gt;

    &lt;div id='separator'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id='right'&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre><code>  #left {
    float: left;
    width: 70%;
    height: 100%;
    overflow: auto;
  }
  #separator {
    float: left;
    width: 3px;
    height: 100%;
    background-color: gray;
    cursor: col-resize;
  }
  #right {
    height: 100%;
    overflow: auto;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>document.querySelector('#separator').addEventListener('drag', function (event) {
  var newX = event.clientX;
  var totalWidth = document.querySelector('#left').offsetWidth;
  document.querySelector('#left').style.width = ((newX / totalWidth) * 100) + '%';
});
</code></pre>

<p>The problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>The resizing happens, but the separator jumps around randomly. It even falls down many times. I have no idea what's happening.</li>
<li>The mouse cursor changes to a hand when the dragging begins. I want it to remain a <code>col-resize</code>.</li>
<li>It is very hard to drag.</li>
</ol>

I could do that using regex.replace and another regex, but I feel it's a big weird doing that and it might be a better way.</p>

Consider for example the following program:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

template&lt;class T&gt;
struct A {
 A() {};
 template&lt;class S&gt;
 A(const A&lt;S&gt;&amp; a) {std::cout &lt;&lt; ""constructor template used for A"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;};
};

template&lt;class T&gt;
struct B{
 B() {};
 B(const B&lt;int&gt;&amp; b) {std::cout &lt;&lt; ""constructor used for B"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;};
};

int main() {
 A&lt;int&gt; a;
 B&lt;int&gt; b;
 A&lt;int&gt; aa = a;
 B&lt;int&gt; bb = b;
 A&lt;double&gt; aaa = a;
}
</code></pre>

<p>For me, this produces the output</p>

<pre><code>constructor used for B
constructor template used for A
</code></pre>

<p>this means it does not use the constructor in the third line of main. Why not? Is there a reason? Or is my syntax off somewhere? The template seems to work, as it is successfully used in the last line.</p>

<p>I know the example seems overly complicated, but various simplifications made the behavior I wanted to display go away. Also: A template specialization will be used by the initialization and is how I currently prevent this causing errors (where it caused errors in the first place).</p>

<p>I have a WinForm application(C#, .NET 3.5) that follows the Asynchronous Event-Based design pattern.</p>

<p>The main control(MainResultControl) creates multiple instances of child controls(ResultControl) as the user requests. Each child control has unique set of parameters that users selects.</p>

<p>Each child control then calls WCF service asynchronously:</p>

<pre><code>WebServiceClient.GetResultsAsync(Parameters param)
</code></pre>

<p>Each child control also signs up for GetResultsCompleted event of the Web Service</p>

<p>WebServiceClient.GetResultsCompleted  += _service_GetResultsCompleted()</p>

<p>Here is the problem that we are facing. Users complain that sometimes ResultControl displays the unexpected set of data - unrelated to what they requested.</p>

<p>Is it possible that one instance of control receives the results that the other instance requested when it handles GetResultsCompleted  event raised in the web service?</p>

<p>Thank you. </p>

<p>Here is some supporting code(VB):
The parent control(MainResultControl)</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Submit_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, _
                         ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles tbSubmit.Click
    'a copy of MyRequestArgs is created with the details of request'
    pnlResult.Controls.Add(new ResultsControl(_myRequestArgs))
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>The child control(ResultsControl):</p>

<pre><code>Public Class ResultsControl

  Public _webRequestResult As WebRequestResult      

  Public Sub New(ByVal _requestArgs As MyRequestArgs)

     Dim _service as MyWebService()
     _service.GetTripSolutionsAsync(New TripPlannerParameters() _
                             With {.ApplicationID = _requestArgs.ApplicationID, _
                                   .Arrival = _requestArgs.Parameters.Arrival, _
                                   .Destination = _requestArgs.Parameters.Destination})
  End Sub

  Private Sub _service_GetTripSolutionsCompleted(ByVal sender As Object, _
                                               ByVal e As MyWebService.ResultCompletedEventArgs) Handles _service.GetTripSolutionsCompleted

     'Validation of correct results is done here

     _webRequestResult = DirectCast(e.Result, WebRequestResult)

  End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I consulted some people and it seems that WCF has some methods of ensuring that event raised from the service is handled by the proper object (on the client machine) that raised it. The idea is - WCF utilizes different IP sockets on the client machine for multiple asynchronous requests. Is that true?</p>

<p>I have found a blog post by the author of Twitter for iPhone that discusses drawing our own graphics for cells to improve performance. This sounds easy enough, right?</p>

<p>So, I began doing that here:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect{

#define MIDDLE_COLUMN_OFFSET 52
#define MIDDLE_COLUMN_WIDTH 180

#define MAIN_FONT_SIZE 12
#define MIN_MAIN_FONT_SIZE 10
#define SECONDARY_FONT_SIZE 10
#define MIN_SECONDARY_FONT_SIZE 10

#define RIGHT_COLUMN_SIZE 70
#define PADDING 4

UIColor * secondaryTextColor = nil;
UIFont * secondaryFont = [UIFont systemFontOfSize:SECONDARY_FONT_SIZE];

//mainTextColor = [UIColor blackColor];
secondaryTextColor = [UIColor blackColor];
self.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];


CGPoint point;

CGSize size;

//[mainTextColor set];

NSString * textToDisplay = @""Test"";

CGPoint rightColumnStart = CGPointMake(self.frame.size.width - PADDING - RIGHT_COLUMN_SIZE, 0);

point = CGPointMake(rightColumnStart.x + (RIGHT_COLUMN_SIZE/2 - size.width/2), 40);
[textToDisplay drawAtPoint:point forWidth:RIGHT_COLUMN_SIZE withFont:secondaryFont minFontSize:MIN_SECONDARY_FONT_SIZE actualFontSize:NULL lineBreakMode:UILineBreakModeTailTruncation baselineAdjustment:UIBaselineAdjustmentAlignBaselines];

    // background color
/*CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();
CGContextBeginPath(context);
CGContextSetFillColorWithColor(context, [UIColor redColor].CGColor);
CGContextAddRect(context, CGRectMake(rightColumnStart.x, 0, RIGHT_COLUMN_SIZE, self.frame.size.height));
CGContextFillPath(context);
 */
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, there is a lot of stuff going on (and a fair amount of hard coding coordinates, just ignore the magic numbers for now).</p>

<p>So, in the code block, if you look for the comment ""background color"", one can see that I'm drawing a colored rectangle. I'm also drawing text ""test"" within the same coordinate space that I want to show up on top of the rectangle.</p>

<p>So, if I run the application without the ""background color"" enabled, the ""test"" text shows up without issue. It is black, size 10, looks great, is positioned correctly, etc.</p>

<p>When I draw the rectangle, the ""test"" text does not show up. It is likely being rendered behind the colored rectangle, or the blending is not being set-up correctly.</p>

<p>How do I avoid this issue and blend the two together so the black text shows up on top of the colored rectangle? I'm not sure what question I should be asking through Google, so I apologize if this is very simple.</p>

<p>Thanks!!!!</p>

<p>Now the trigger keeps the data consistent for inserted/updated/deleted ids:</p>

<p>Now we find in the test table the following:</p>

<p><strong>The problem here is the MEMBER OF statement. It is causing full table scans for each of it's members</strong>. 
In case of multi-update/insert statements, there are many potential ids changed, so the l_changed_ids collection is large.
I can not optimize the MEMBER OF:

<p>I have tried:</p>

<ol>
<li>Casting the collection with TABLE() is quite slow for many single inserts/updates.</li>
<li>Updating inconsistent rows from within a loop is a bad idea because for n-bulk statements this could potentially reactivate the trigger n times recursively. But (!) using a loop is very fast because the index on id is used every time. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My questions are:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Is there an other trigger-approach for this. </li>
<li>The trigger must work for single and bulk update/delete/insert statements. So if there are inconsistencies, there might only one extra update statement be executed recursively. </li>
<li>The trigger locks the rows based on id. (This is a later requirement but might be interesting to think about it now.)</li>
</ol>

At a particular moment in time I would like to send this mean value and receive it on all slaves. This should be done only once. At first glance I taught that this should be fairly easy to do. So I used an internal variable (the loop count) to do the following</p>

<pre><code>! on the master
if( i == 55 ) 
do mt = 1, tasks
call MPI_SEND(A,size,MPI_DOUBLE_PRECISION,mt,5,MPI_COMM_WORLD,status,ierror)
end do

! on the slaves
if(i==55) then
call MPI_RECV(a,size,MPI_DOUBLE_PRECISION,0,5, MPI_COMM_WORLD,status,ierror)
endif
</code></pre>

<p>Running this caused segmentation fault, at the line where the MPI_RECV is called. In general this would work if I was communicating continuously, i.e. sending and receiving data during the entire loop.</p>

<p>The most natural thing would be to assume that the variable I am using for triggering the communication is not synchronized between the master and the slaves. Therefore, I decided to send an integer value to the slaves, and use it as a singnal for calling MPI_RECV. Unfortunately this caused a communication deadlock. I did something like:</p>

<pre><code>! on the master
sig = 0
if ( i == 55) then 
sig = 1
call MPI_SEND(sig,1,MPI_INTEGER,mt,10,MPI_COMM_WORLD,status,ierror)
endif

if(i==55) then
do mt =1,tasks
call MPI_SEND(A,size,MPI_DOUBLE_PRECISION,mt,5,MPI_COMM_WORLD,status,ierror)
end do
endif 

! on the slaves
call MPI_RECV(sig,1,MPI_INTEGER,mt,10,MPI_COM_WORLD,status,ierror)
if ( sig == 1) Call MPI_RECV(a,size,MPI_DOUBLE_PRECISION,0,5,   MPI_COMM_WORLD,status,ierror)

I'm able to expose and consume the domain services from server to client, but I'm struggling with getting columns autogenerated in the datagrid when the result of the query on the server holds no data.</p>

<pre><code> &lt;riaControls:DomainDataSource Name=""domainDataSource1"" 
        LoadSize=""20"" QueryName=""GetUsers"" AutoLoad=""True"" &gt;
            &lt;riaControls:DomainDataSource.DomainContext&gt;
                &lt;ds:CobraDomainContext /&gt;
            &lt;/riaControls:DomainDataSource.DomainContext&gt;
&lt;/riaControls:DomainDataSource&gt;

&lt;sdk:DataGrid ItemsSource=""{Binding Data, ElementName=domainDataSource1}"" AutoGenerateColumns=""True"" IsReadOnly=""False"" Width=""250"" Height=""150"" &gt;
            &lt;/sdk:DataGrid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This renders an empty 250x150 datagrid (no columns/no rows). I was expecting that the colunms for the user entity were displayed even though no data was returned from the server since the view would kind of suck otherwise initially. My brain can't  can't seem to figure out what is wrong, so I'll crowdsource with stackoverflow. </p>

<p>UPDATE: I was kind of expecting the result from the query to be a typed enumeration, but it appears that the result of the query on the DomainDataService is just IEnumerable but not typed, so the internal logic needs to look into the list to discover what kind of data it is containing.</p>

<p>So the updated question is: Can I give the DataGrid a hint on what type of data will be returned or otherwise autogenerate columns in the grid (through XAML or code)??</p>

<p>These are points along the body of a snake, digitized from top-down video.  Their posture frequently results in 2 or more Y points per X, and because they turn (often dramatically) while I need to maintain a consistent XY framework, I can't just rotate my X and Y.</p>

<p>I can make a spline function using <code>cscvn</code>, and when plotted using <code>fnplt</code> it looks great!  But the moment I try to get values back using <code>ppval</code>, it all goes to crap and I get two curves that look nothing like the snake or what's shown in <code>fnplt</code>.</p>

<p>IMAGE HERE:
<a href=""http://imgur.com/aYJ0Ftj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/aYJ0Ftj</a></p>

<p>All I want is to fit a curve to those points, and convert that curve to a series of maybe 200 XY points.</p>

<p>I'm assuming that there is some obscenely simple answer, some command I've just never turned up in my searching, but I cannot find it for the life of me.  This is quite far outside my usual skillset (I'm more used to crawling through swamps catching anything scaly or slimy), so I'm sure I'm overlooking something totally obvious to a skilled MATLAB user.</p>

<p>I've run into problems where the program would hang and I would get no browser instances open or sometimes up to 20 instances open.
I would like to create an error check to make sure there is only one browser instance open at a time (kill the browser completely and restart the iteration if there are many instances open and/or make sure a browser instance is open before going through an iteration of the loop).</p>

<p>The PID for the browser obviously changes through every iteration of the loop and as far as I know, there is no way to assign PIDs.
Another solution I thought of is making a system call to the terminal and somehow utilizing the tasklist and taskkill commands but have still not figured out a way to do what I want.</p>

<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I understand I can search windows processes by name but how would I put that into a boolean expression like</p>

<pre><code>if tasklist contains firefox.exe
    taskkill firefox.exe
else
    open firefox
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Second Update:</strong></p>

<p>I have the following that I was able to code in Ruby which works:</p>

<pre><code>    if system('tasklist | find ""firefox.exe""') == true
        a = 1
    elsif system('tasklist | find ""firefox.exe""') == false
        a = 0
    end
</code></pre>

<p>How would I accomplish this in Python?</p>

<p><strong>Answer I was looking for:</strong></p>

<pre><code>b = (str(os.system('tasklist | find ""firefox.exe""')))
if b == '1':
    b = 'false'
elif b == '0':
    b = 'true'
print b

Part of the output is an encrypted salt to use when generating a hmac_hash with some of the information stored in the cookie, and some of the user information in the database.</p>

<p>However, after some testing, I've ran into a problem with the encryption/decryption of the strings and causing different hash results.</p>

<p>ie:</p>

<pre><code>$str = '123456abcdef';
$hash1 = sha1($str);

$v1 = do_encrypt($str);
$v2 = do_decrypt($v1);

$hash2 = sha1($v2);
</code></pre>

<p>and I end up with</p>

<pre><code>$hash1 - d4fbef92af33c1789d9130384a56737d181cc6df 
$hash2 - 0d6034f417c2cfe1d60d263101dc0f8354a1216f
</code></pre>

<p>but when I echo both strings, they are both 123456abcdef.</p>

<p>The do_encrypt function is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>function do_encrypt($value) {

    $salt = generate_salt();
    $td = mcrypt_module_open('rijndael-256', '', 'cbc', '');
    mcrypt_generic_init($td, $ek, $salt);
    $encrypted_data = mcrypt_generic($td, $value);

    mcrypt_generic_deinit($td);
    mcrypt_module_close($td);
    return base64_encode($salt.$encrypted_data);    
}
</code></pre>

<p>The do_decrypt function:</p>

<pre><code>function do_decrypt($value) {

    $data = base64_decode($value);
    $salt = substr($data, 0, 32);
    $data = substr($data, 32, strlen($data));
    $td = mcrypt_module_open('rijndael-256', '', 'cbc', '');
    mcrypt_generic_init($td, $ek, $salt);
    $decrypted_data = mdecrypt_generic($td, $data);

    mcrypt_generic_deinit($td);
    mcrypt_module_close($td);
    return $decrypted_data;
}
</code></pre>

<p>for both functions $ek is an encryption key pulled from another file.</p>

<p>I'm trying to understand why the characters that display are the same, but the actual variables are different (otherwise the hash results would be the same), and is there any way to ensure that both strings are identical for hashing purposes?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Ryan.</p>

<p>With this function the img.hover is shown on hover. That's the first working part.</p>

<pre><code>$(""#wrapper_map img.main"").hover(function() {
        $(this).animate({""opacity"": ""0""},100);
    }, function() {
        $(this).animate({""opacity"": ""1""},100);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now i would like to make an infinite animation :</p>

<pre><code>Show then hide "".map1 img.hover"" when it's finish,
Show then hide "".map2 img.hover"" when it's finish,
Show then hide "".map3 img.hover"" when it's finish,
Show then hide "".map4 img.hover"" when it's finish,
Show then hide "".map5 img.hover"" when it's finish, resart the animation.
</code></pre>

<p>But i need that when the mouse hover on a div (.map1, .map2 etc..) to show the img class hover of the div.
When mouse quit div wrapper_map restart the infinite animation.</p>

<p>I really want to do something like this, but i need help please !!</p>

<p>You can see the function basically fades out one box and fades in another. You can see that the box it fades in is always the same name as the .click function, except it's a separate CSS id container and not a class. I figure there must be a way to create a shared function for each of these that somehow changes the the name of the class to an id matching the same name of the function, and re-uses the rest of the code. Can anyone help me shed some light on this?</p>

matches = re.search(regex1, regex2)

<p>I used the same concept to match a <code>string</code> and a <code>regex</code> which was a working. But it doesn't work in this case where both string have wildcards. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>As you see there is one wrapper for the menu and the button that triggers the mobile menu. The bit of jquery which includes slideToggle:</p>

<pre><code>$('#responsive-menu').click(
     function () {
       $("".menu"").slideToggle();
       $(""#responsive-menu"").toggleClass(""active"");
     }
);
</code></pre>

<p>The thing with this is that the slideToggle is in fact triggered and there is stuff happening. Also there are no errors whatsoever. The menu isn't being made visible though and I really can't figure out why, does anyone know how to solve this?</p>

<p>However, there are numerous implementations of classes in JavaScript.</p>

<p>All implementations I've seen require the use of self invoking functions to create private, instance-based, efficient functions.</p>

<p>A function has privacy</p>

<pre><code>var foo = function(){ /* private to foo here */ };
</code></pre>

<p>but if you prototype off of it you now have public, instance-based, efficient members.</p>

<pre><code>foo.prototype.func = function(){ /* private to func */ }; // foo.func in public now.
</code></pre>

<p>if you place a function in foo like this</p>

<pre><code>var foo = function() { 
    var funcInner = function(){}; 
}; // funcInner is now re-defined in each call to foo.  In-efficient.
</code></pre>

<p>you get the missing privacy but now there are in-efficiencies.</p>

<p>Hence, the only way to have private, instance based, efficient functions is to use the module pattern ( or similar self invoking pattern ) as such</p>

<pre><code>    var NS = (function(){ 
    var private = function(){ /* code */ }; // only created once b.c. in module pattern.
    var publik = {};
        publik.funcPublic = function(){ /* code */ };
    return publik;
})();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Calling</strong></p>

<pre><code>NS.funcPublic();

<p>From this it seems that to have private, instance based, efficient functions, a small amount of execution time will be necessary?</p>

The example below shows two adjacent K2,2 bicliques - the first clique is {A,B,1,2} and the second clique is {B,C,2,3}. I would like to be able to identify these cliques using R so that I can apply this to a broader dataset.</p>

<p>I have included my attempt so far in R and I am stuck with the following two issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>If I use the standard walktrap.community it recognises the communities but does not allow the set {B,2} to belong in both cliques</li>
<li>If I use an updated <a href=""http://igraph.wikidot.com/community-detection-in-r"" rel=""nofollow"">clique.community</a> function this doesn't seem to identify the cliques or I don't understand correctly (or both)</li>

<p>I forgor to mention that, in my <code>ApplicationController</code>, there's a before_filter called <code>check_plan_features</code> and the first thing it asks is <code>unless current_user.blank? #redirects to Admin section</code>.</p>

<p>I've noticed that after signing in, using Devise, <code>current_user</code> has the user's value, but when after redirecting to the admin section, it comes back  to the same filter, and this time, the <code>current_user</code> is null. <strong>So, I assume that, somehow, the user's session is destroyed after trying to access Admin section. But, as this only happens on production environment, I'm still wondering what could be.</strong></p>

<p>I have an oracle database that I need to extract data from to populate a table on a PHP page. The table is called Flowers and has Name, Price and Stock columns.</p>

<p>The part of the PHP code I'm having trouble with is this:</p>

<pre><code>$titlevalue = Trim($_REQUEST['search']);
$query = ""SELECT * FROM FLOWERS WHERE NAME = '$titlevalue'"";

$stmt = OCIParse($connect, $query); 
if(!$stmt) {
    echo ""An error occurred in parsing the sql string.\n""; 
    exit; 
}
OCIExecute($stmt);
</code></pre>

<p>The rest of my PHP works -perfectly- when using a different table on my database, which I did as a test. Just in case, this is the code that prints the query results (it's part of an HTML table, but you can ignore that):</p>

<pre><code>while(OCIFetch($stmt)) {
    echo ""&lt;tr valign=top bgcolor=#F7D4A3&gt;"";
    $fg1 = OCIResult($stmt,""NAME"");
    echo ""&lt;td width=75&gt;"";
    echo $fg1;
    echo ""&lt;/td&gt;"";
// Display values in column two.
    $fg2 = OCIResult($stmt,""PRICE"");
    echo ""&lt;td width=75&gt;"";
    echo ($fg2);
    echo ""&lt;/td&gt;"";
// Display values in column three
    $fg3 = OCIResult($stmt, ""STOCK"");
    echo ""&lt;td width=75&gt;"";
    include($fg3);
    echo ""&lt;/td&gt;"";
    echo ""&lt;/tr&gt;"";
} 
</code></pre>

<p>No matter what $titlevalue becomes, I just can't get results with this table. I have also tested it with a generic <code>$query = ""SELECT * FROM FLOWERS"";</code>, but that didn't produce anything either.</p>

After a given amount of time, everyone gets up an moves to a different table. The idea is that everyone has to have the opportunity to talk to each person. He's trying to figure out how to do it with 16 people and 4 tables where everyone moves 5 times.</p>

<p>I wanted to figure out an algorithm to do that, but I found the problem is much more challenging than I imagined at first. To simplify it, I worked out how to do it with 6 people and 3 tables. It can be represented as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Step 1: (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)
Step 2: (1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 6)
Step 3: (1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 5)
Step 4: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 6)
Step 5: (1, 6), (2, 3), (4, 5)
</code></pre>

<p>One possibility, which wouldn't be very efficient, would be to generate all the possible combinations and eliminate any that are mutually exclusive. However with odd combinations, that wouldn't be possible. For example, if there were 6 people with only 2 tables, there would be two people sitting at the same table more than once. Of course, the idea of the algorithm is to have everyone meet at least once in the shortest number of steps.</p>

However, these paramaterized types need to implement the Comparable interface (because the list will be automatically sorted and organized).</p>

<p>The problem I am having is with syntax and ensuring that <strong>1)</strong> the list elements are Comparable Objects, not just any Objects, and <strong>2)</strong> getter methods like <code>get(index)</code> should return Objects of the type for the list without requiring the cast, i.e. if a list is created paramaterized with <code>&lt; Integer ></code>, <code>get()</code> should have a return type of Integer, not Comparable or Object.</p>

<p>I know that parameterized objects in Java can be created using things like <code>&lt; E ></code> and <code>&lt; T ></code>, but this does not allow me to require that the elements of the list be Comparable.</p>

<p>By the way, if you have any comments like ""Just use ArrayList or LinkedList."" or ""Why are you using a custom list, stupid?"", <strong>please keep them to yourself</strong>. I want to create a well-organized, efficient list system that doesn't fit with any existing structures. The Comparable requirement is necessary for the list to be sorted automatically.</p>

<p>If anyone could give me an idea of how to do this, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

I am familiar with Java, and a little bit of Python. I have 'read' through a c++ for dummies book, and I thought I had the grip - until I tried to create the simplest class. 
The idea was <em>very</em> simple: a class (named ape) takes one parameter, an int, which is stored as a private field. It has one other function, a return function, which returns the field. The main() creates an instance, and calls the method to print out the variable. </p>

<p>The idea was to use a string instead of an int, but I couldn't get it working, so I decided to use an int instead, which, obviously, wasn't working either. </p>

<p>If it is to any interest I use Code::blocks, Windows 7 and the g++ compiler. </p>

<p>Here are the classes: </p>

<p>Main.cpp</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include ""ape.h""

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    ape asd(10);
    cout &lt;&lt; asd.getNumber();
}
</code></pre>

<p>ape.h</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef APE_H
#define APE_H

class ape
{
    public:
        ape(int num);
        virtual ~ape();
        int getNumber();
    protected:
    private:
        int number;
};

#endif // APE_H
</code></pre>

<p>and ape.cpp</p>

<pre><code>#include ""ape.h""
using namespace std;

ape::ape(int num)
{
    tall = num;
}

ape::~ape()
{
    //dtor
}

int getNumber()
{
    return number;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The error messages I get seems very random to me, as they are changing completely with every single change I make, and are not very self explaining. I can see how I sound like an arrogant fool, and that this whole mess is the compilers fault, but I really don't see any connection between the error messages and what's wrong in my code.</p>

<p>Take it easy on me, first time here. :)</p>

<p>I guess I should probably add the error message:

<p>thank you.</p>

<p>[updated 0]</p>

<p>eg the style below. when i debug into the script. I found the script_ltime value and dest_file_mtime value won't be equial. </p>

<pre><code>if ($script_ltime eq $dest_file_mtime ) // eq used 
{
    printf ""No $this_file Scan Needed\n"";
    exit(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>btw, if i instead of the script with the style belwo. i found even i modified my script. The script still won't be scan again. For the dest_file_mtime value always greater than source_mtime value.</p>

<pre><code>if ($dest_file_mtime gt $source_mtime) // gt used
{
    printf ""No $this_file Scan Needed\n"";
    exit(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Tha't why i confued to use eq OR gt. and which style is better for ""When I changed one of the three file, the script will always scan needed.""</p>

<p>[updated 1]</p>

<pre><code>if (-e $dest_file)  {
    open(DEST_FILE, ""$dest_file"") ;

Question is-
Write a program that will evaluate simple expressions such as 17 + 3 and 3.14159 *
4.7. The expressions are to be typed in by the user. The input always consists of a number, followed by an operator, followed by another number. The operators that are allowed are +, -, *, and /. You are not required to perform data validation here as it is to be done in part (b) below. Your program output must show the expression entered together with the result (e.g. 17 + 3 = 20).</p>

<p>Part B:
Modify your program in part (a) above to validate the operator entered. The program repeats for the input until a valid operator is entered. You are required to make use of method for the validation.</p>

I decided to use <a href=""https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib"" rel=""nofollow"">dnlib</a> that looks like a powerful library to manipulate .NET files. It is underdocumented unfortunately.</p>

<p>I load the file the usual way. The <code>ModuleDefMD</code> <code>Load()</code> methods seem to be the only way to load the file:</p>

<pre><code>ModuleDefMD module = ModuleDefMD.Load(""test.dll"");
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the dnlib has <code>Writer</code> namespace that suggests it should be used to write to the .NET structures. It contains <a href=""https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib/blob/59281085c10dc6f0ef497893821c8a8629c81349/src/DotNet/Writer/USHeap.cs#L13"" rel=""nofollow""><code>USHeap</code> class</a> that looks promising.</p>

<p>It seems the Writer needs to create metadata that it can work on:</p>

<pre><code>dnlib.DotNet.Writer.MetaData metadata = dnlib.DotNet.Writer.MetaData.Create(module, null, null, null);
</code></pre>

<p>In the USHeap class there is <a href=""https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib/blob/59281085c10dc6f0ef497893821c8a8629c81349/src/DotNet/Writer/USHeap.cs#L154"" rel=""nofollow""><code>SetRawData()</code> method</a> with <a href=""https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib/blob/59281085c10dc6f0ef497893821c8a8629c81349/src/DotNet/Writer/IOffsetHeap.cs#L25"" rel=""nofollow"">description</a> ""Overrides what value should be written to the heap"". The rest is unclear, let's use it anyway to write 3 raw arbitrary bytes. According to the CLI standard, the first valid offset is 1:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] raw_data = { 0x61, 0x62, 0x63 };   // ""abc""
uint offset = 1;   // the least valid offset in #US heap
metadata.USHeap.SetRawData(offset, raw_data);
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib/tree/59281085c10dc6f0ef497893821c8a8629c81349/Examples"" rel=""nofollow"">dnlib Examples</a> show how to write the file:</p>

<pre><code>module.Write(""test-out.dll"");
</code></pre>

<p>This code compiles and runs without errors. Unfortunately the new file has the same #US stream contents as the original.</p>

<p>It seems I didn't get the idea how the Writer works. Studying the sources is not easy as dnlib consists of quite a lot source files and lines.</p>

<p>Which is still fine. Then, I try to post a photo to the app_id/photos feed, and it does not work = it uploads the photo correctly, but shows me (as in my profile) uploading the photo rather then the Page itself. What could be the problem?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>the <code>[result description]</code> log from the call is fine (it returns the id = xx and ""post_id"" = yy, which I assume are correct), as is the call itself - the only problem is that it shows me as the author, and not the Page itself.
MyPageID is correct, because calling </p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary *paramsFeed = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjects:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""This is my first page post from xcode app"", nil] forKeys:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""message"", nil]];

 }];

<p>Also, calling <code>me/photos</code> and posting the photo there with dictionaryKey @""picture"" works, and it posts the photo on my own wall perfectly.</p>

<p>To be more specific, let's present an example. Let's say that I want to create a site that handles a forum, a site that handles customers and their orders where people will also be able to participate in a forum, and a site that handles polls. Let's say that when designing these sites, I decided to write the following ""modules"" (apps, plugins, whatever their name should be): A Users module, a Forum module, a Customers module and a polls module. I'd like to maintain each module separately, and be able use them as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When creating the Forum site I'd like to use the Forum module and the Users module.</p></li>
<li><p>When creating the Customers site I'd like to use the Users module, the Forum module and the Customers module.</p></li>
<li><p>When creating the Pools site I'd like to use the Users module and the Polls module.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, the Forums module, the Customers module and the Polls module should depend on the Users module, and their models.py should be referencing the Users module's users-schema (assuming that we are working with relational databases and I we are using sqlalchemy for our ORM representation). Each module should have their own static content, models, forms, etc.</p>

<p>I know that the example I've given could have been solved with different designs, but please, this was the first example that came to my mind that indeed fits my questions, so let's -please- pretend that it is indeed a requirement.</p>

<p>That said: How could I achieve this functionality with pyramid? I think that configuration wise, config.include() is my probable candidate, but the implementation is very unclear to me, so any help would be really appreciated!</p>

<p>But the two buttons of my secondary window seem to not be connected to my slots. Everythin is fine except that, and I checked, if I use this class alone, without passing the QMainWindow in argument, it works perfectly.</p>

<p>Would you have an idea about why these slots are not connected ? Maybe the signals are not emitted properly ?</p>

<p>As outlined in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/9773674/998117"">this</a> answer, you can dissolve changes as so:</p>

<pre><code>UIImage * toImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@""myname.png""];

<p>The model binder does its magic just fine and the list is correctly populated. However, after I process the request in the action (e.g. remove the appropriate items) and return a new view containing fewer items, the state of the form is 'semi' persisted. Some check boxes remain checked, even though in the edit model all the bools are set to false.</p>

<p>I don't have this problem if I return a <code>RedirectToActionResult</code>, but using that as a solution seems a bit of a hacky work around.</p>

<p>I think I need to flush/refresh the ModelState, or something similiar, but I'm unsure of the terms to search for to find out how.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_10_2#linux_armv7"">https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_10_2#linux_armv7</a></p>

<p>This says it was built with debian jesse, so I've installed debian jesse on my pi2.  I've installed ghc successfully - at least ghci works.  But there's no cabal, and apparently ghc 7.10.2 requires cabal 1.22+.  The debian version of cabal is something like 1.16 (and also would install ghc 7.6.x).  So I'm trying to install cabal-install from source with its bootstrap.sh script.  That downloads the mtl package and builds a 'Setup' executble, then tries to execute it.  But the Setup exe fails with 'illegal instruction'.  </p>

<p>According to the download page, the 'gold' linker is required.  I added that by doing </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ln -s <code>which gold</code> ~/bin/ld</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and setting my path to include ~/bin.  Same result unfortunately.  </p>

<p>Next up I tried reinstalling the ghc binaries with gold (I think).  So as root:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ln -s `which gold` /usr/local/bin/ld
&gt; cd ghc-7.10.2
&gt; make install
</code></pre>

<p>Once again ghc was successfully installed, but the result for building cabal-install is the same:</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I'm wondering if the symlinks is the correct way to enable gold for this?  Maybe I need to add that as a ghc option in each cabal project, or there's some other way to use gold?  Or maybe that's not the issue at all?  </p>

<p>The InfoWindow content is loaded via Ajax, so I'm no really sure where to put the Jquery bit - although I have tried (I think!) every possible combination.</p>

<p>Solutions tried: 
<a href=""http://www.narga.net/making-awesome-forms-inline-labels-with-jquery/"" rel=""nofollow"">Making Awesome Form’s Inline Labels with jQuery</a>, <a href=""http://trevordavis.net/blog/jquery-inline-form-labels/"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery Inline Form Labels</a>,  <a href=""http://zurb.com/playground/inline-form-labels"" rel=""nofollow"">Awesome Inline Form Labels</a>  and others...</p>

<p>The only thing that works is HTML5's <code>placeholder</code> but I'm not happy about this because it doesn't work very well below IE10.</p>

<p>Here is a snapshot of the desired effect:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/h6ltH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I would like this to work inside this InfoWindow below. See the text ""Nome opcional""? I'd like it to be an inline blurred label, like the picture above.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/GOYBs.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This is the code used to load the InfoWindow contents:</p>

<pre><code>function load_newinfowindow_content(lat, long, infowindow){
    $.ajax({
    url: site_root +'map/newmarker_infowindow/'+lat+'/'+long,
    success: function(data){
      infowindow.setContent(data);
    }
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>The infoWindow is basic HTML form. The CSS is global for all pages, including the InfoWindow (and it works fine).</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form name=""newMark"" id=""newMark"" method=post action=""&lt;?php echo base_url();?&gt;map/new_marker""&gt;
&lt;input type=hidden name=latitude value=""&lt;?php echo $lat;?&gt;""&gt;&lt;input type=hidden name=longitude value=""&lt;?php echo $long;?&gt;""&gt;
Deseja criar uma nova marcação aqui?
&lt;label for=""name""&gt;Nome opcional&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input class=""text name"" type=""text"" id=""name"" name=""name"" size=""20""/&gt;
&lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Sim""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have already tried placing the JQuery's <code>ready</code> code inside the InfoWindow HTML and ""outside"" on the calling page. Neither works.
Any hints on why this should not work inside an InfoWindow?</p>

<p>The middle parameter/lambda (called the accumulator) would seem to be capable of reducing the full list without the final 'Combiner' parameter.  In fact, the Javadoc actually says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The {@code accumulator} function acts as a fused mapper and
  accumulator,
       * which can sometimes be more efficient than separate mapping and reduction,
       * such as when knowing the previously reduced value allows you to avoid
       * some computation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Edit From Author] -</strong> The following statement is wrong, so don't let it confuse you; I'm just keeping it here so I don't ruin the original context of the answers.</p>

<p>Anyway, I can infer that the accumulator must just be outputting 1's and 0's which the combiner combines.  I didn't find this particularly obvious from the documentation though.</p>

<p><strong>My Question</strong></p>

<p>Is there a way to see what the output would be before the combiner executes so I can see the list of 1's and 0's that the combiner combines?  This would be helpful in debugging more complex situations which I'm sure I'll come across eventually.</p>

<p>It displays ""My Header"" and ""My Footer"" on the top and bottom, centered and in small font. I want it to be large font and aligned left. Is this possible?</p>

<p>If it is not possible, is there a way to change the height of the header and footer block? When I change the margin (for instance,  x:Margin=""0.75""  ) the header ends up moving down but going behind the spreadsheet data text that is normally below it.</p>

I have a <code>UITableView</code> with a <code>UISearchBar</code> as its <code>tableHeaderView.</code> Whenever the scope buttons appear, they cover the first row of the <code>UITableView</code>. </p>

<p>I have tried using <code>UITableView.contentOffset</code> to offset the <code>UITableView</code> by the height of the scope buttons, and this works until the user taps the <code>UITableView</code> or scrolls it, at which point the <code>UITableView</code> jumps back to its original offset.</p>

<p>The best I've been able to do is set the <code>UISearchBar</code> as a separate item in the view, and simply resize the <code>UITableView</code> dynamically to show or hide it when the user taps a search button. The only problem is that there is no animation, so the transition is sharp. </p>

<p>UPDATE: I solved the problem by implementing a <code>UISearchDisplayController</code>, as this was the cleanest and easiest solution to work with. The <code>UISearchDisplayController</code> automatically shows/hides the scope buttons and moves the <code>UITableView</code> down accordingly. I didn't do this at first because I wanted the <code>UITableView</code> to remain visible rather than initially being blacked out by the <code>UISearchDisplayController</code>, however I've come to realize that the blackout does not hinder any functionality; the user would not have initiated a search if he wanted to continue looking at the <code>UITableView</code> the way it was.</p>

select * from student where id=4;

<p><em>This is what I know to the best of my knowledge.</em> </p>

<p><strong>Now I want to fire a query with multiple WHERE IN CLAUSE</strong></p>

<pre><code>SELECT    Count(*) NO_OF_PO, QUANTITY FROM    INTER_DEFECT idp
WHERE    DEFECT_ID =1
AND    PO_NUMBER =4
AND    SUPP_ID = 7

<p>etc etc. </p>

<p>So you see the <strong>Parameter order should not change</strong> like</p>

<p>DEFECT_ID =1 should fire with PO_NUMBER =4 for example</p>

<p><code>DEFECT_ID =1 AND PO_NUMBER =4 ....</code></p>

<p>And

<p><code>DEFECT_ID =2 AND PO_NUMBER =5 ....</code></p>

                    -&gt; Restaurants

<p>This all makes perfect sense if festivals were always located in a city. But what about the scenario where the festival is national? Would I have to implement the same content type of 'Festivals' against both 'Cities' and 'Countries' in order to accomplish this or is there a way to have 'Festivals' sit at the root of the hierarchy and allow me to selected a related 'Country' or 'City' as they are required?</p>

<p>The code compiles fine on MonoDevelop 3.0, but gives an error in VS2010 saying:
An object reference is required for the non-static field, method, or property ""Base.Execute""
Basically, it boils down to the fact that when calling base class's constructor from derived class's constructor, MS's C# compiler does not allow access to derived class's methods/properties, etc. How so?</p>

<p>Unfortunately this can't work in ClojureScript at this point, due to the lack of extend. Is there any alternative or should I fall back to bare functions instead of defrecord? </p>

<p>Maybe some context on my code would help you answer this question. 
I transform some data through a pipeline of wrappers implementing this protocol: </p>

<pre><code>(defprotocol Wrapper 
  (wrap-data [this data])) 
</code></pre>

<p>Some of my wrappers can be toggled on/off so I added this protocol: </p>

<pre><code>(defprotocol Togglable 
  (toggle [this]) 
  (on? [this])) 
</code></pre>

<p>Such a togglable wrapper would be implemented like this: </p>

<pre><code>(defrecord MyWrapper [on] 
  Togglable 
  (toggle [this] (update-in this [:on] not)) 
  (on? [this] on) 
  Wrapper 
  (wrap-data [this data] 
    (if on 
      (do-something data) 
      data))) 
</code></pre>

<p>Now I realized that my implementation for the Togglable protocol would always be the same, so I would have liked a way to write the code only once. The only solution I found to do that while keeping my Togglable protocol, is the following macro: </p>

<pre><code>(defmacro deftogglable [name fields &amp; specs]    
  `(defrecord ~name [~@fields ~'on] 
     ~'Togglable 
     (~'toggle [this#] (update-in this# [:on] not)) 
     (~'on? [~'this] ~'on) 
     ~@specs))
</code></pre>

<p>Which I can use like this: </p>

<pre><code>(macro/deftogglable MyWrapper [] 
                    Wrapper 
                    (wrap-data [this data] 
                                (if on 
                                  (do-something data) 
                                  chart))) 
</code></pre>

<p>I don't like this approach too much because it's very specific and wouldn't compose well, or allow overriding some of the functions. </p>

<p>How would you go to solve this problem? </p>

<p>Thanks, </p>

<p>What is the most efficient way of merging them together into the same queue (or stack) as a single sorted sequence without additional stack/queue?</p>

<p>It seems that the best I thought of so far is a quadratic algorithm that is basically selection sort, and it doesn't really take advantage of the fact that the queue and the stack are pre-sorted and their size. I am wondering if we can do better?</p>

For example, say I have a linked list, and I want to swap the elements at index 4 and 5 (say the list has 10 elements).
If I use the code:</p>

<pre><code>Node tempAt = getNode(4);
Node tempPost = getNode(5);
getNode(3).next = tempPost;
tempAt.next = tempPost.next;
tempPost.next = getNode(3);

<p>Does this work? Basically, I'm getting mixed up with variables. When you set one node equal to another (Ex: <code>Node temp = listHead</code>), is temp essentially the same as the node listHead? If I modify <code>listHead</code>, will <code>temp</code> be modified as well?
EDIT:
Also, if I create something like: <code>Node temp = listHead</code>, and then change the value of <code>listHead.next</code>, what will be the value of <code>temp.next</code>?</p>

<p>Anyway, I've got a big class called <code>Board</code>. In board is <code>ArrayList&lt;Space&gt; sList</code>, a list of Space on the Board. Which each Space is <code>bList</code>, a HashMap that represents which Spaces border this particular Space. The <code>init()</code> method of <code>Board</code> creates all the Spaces and gives them their borders, for example</p>

<pre><code>sList.add(new Location(7, true, ""Police Station""));
sList.get(3).addToBList(sList.get(7)); //adds ""Police Station"" to the bList at sList index 3
</code></pre>

<p>However, if, while in <code>Board</code>, I try and look the <code>bList</code> of a certain Space, it always returns null, like I never added anything to bList. However, if I look within the Space itself, bList is always full of items. So, basically, I'm trying to invoke a variable from a class in another class and it only shows non-null values if I'm within that other class itself - any ideas (or clarifying questions)?</p>

<p>EDIT: I think I'm going to clarify my own question.</p>

<p>If Space has a getBList() getter that returns bList (which is a hashMap), and in Board I add certain values to that bList, why does bList return ""{}"" when I call getBList() in Board?</p>

<p>Inside each of these UIViews, I'm creating a MPMoviePlayerController.</p>

<p>Apple's documentation clearly states:</p>

<pre><code>Note: Although you may create multiple MPMoviePlayerController objects and present 
their views in your interface, only one movie player at a time may play its movie.
</code></pre>

<p>So as the user scrolls I'm pausing and playing the different MPMoviePlayerControllers stored in the playersArray. I do this calling two methods from the UIScrollViewDelegate protocol: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>scrollViewWillBeginDragging: - With this method I detect that the user is scrolling to another View, so I pause the current MPMoviePlayerController and insert a thumbnail image with the current playtime of the movie.</p></li>
<li><p>scrollViewDidEndDecelerating: - In here, I get the View in which the user stopped scrolling, so first I hide the thumbnail and then play the MPMoviePlayerController from that specific View</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's how I accomplished it:</p>

<p>My .h:</p>

<pre><code>    @interface ViewController : UIViewController&lt;UIScrollViewDelegate,UIGestureRecognizerDelegate&gt;

    @property(strong,nonatomic) NSMutableArray * viewsArray;
    @property(strong,nonatomic) UIScrollView * myScrollView;
    @property int numberOfViews;
    @property(strong,nonatomic) NSMutableArray * playersArray;
    @end

<p><strong>MY PROBLEM:</strong></p>

<p>When I run it in my iOS 6 Simulator it works as intended, but as soon as I run it on my device (iPhone with iOS 5.1), the middle views (indexes 1 and 2 from my viewsArray), don't show any video, only sound...</p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

<a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/json/json_http.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3schools.com/json/json_http.asp</a>
to make a html page that get the tweets using javascript XMLHttpRequest.
The problem is that it seems not to work in firefox or chrome it will only work in internet explorer, yet when I changed the url to: <a href=""http://mysafeinfo.com/api/data?list=englishmonarchs&amp;format=json"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mysafeinfo.com/api/data?list=englishmonarchs&amp;format=json</a> to get the json from it, It works in both browsers so I think the problem is in how my servlet response with json.</p>

<p>Am I filling the jsonstring wrong? Or am I somehow setting the content type wrong? After trying to trace the html page with javascript in firefox somehow when xmlhttp.readyState is 4 xmlhttp.status returned is 0 -when using my servlet only-.</p>

<p>Edit 1: I also tried using gson to make the json but it seems not work too.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Solved the problem by adding</p>

<pre><code>  resp.addHeader(""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"", ""*"");

<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>SOAP server will not process method that receive TSOAPAttachment object after a non-exist method is invoked.</li>
<li>The TSOAPAttachment.SourceStream become inaccessible and TSOAPAttachment.CachFile is empty after the non-exist method is invoked</li>
<li>BorlandSoapAttachment(n) temp file is locked and piling up when the problem happen.</li>
<li>Back to normal after restarting IIS or recycling the App Pool</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The steps of create this problem:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Create a simple Soap client/server application with 3 methods initially, one of them should receive and return a TSOAPAttachment, the other 2 can be anything, int or string.</li>
<li>I actually followed this article <a href=""http://blogs.embarcadero.com/pawelglowacki/2008/12/18/38624"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.embarcadero.com/pawelglowacki/2008/12/18/38624</a> to create the simple soap application, but add a method to receive and return  TSOAPAttachment. So my Interface looks like this: </li>
</ul>

<p>code  </p>

<pre><code>  TSimpleCalculator = class(TInvokableClass, ISoapCalculator)
  private
  public
    function add(a, b: Integer) : Integer; stdcall;
    function subtract(a, b: Integer): Integer; stdcall;
    function TestRequest(const Request: TSOAPAttachment): TSOAPAttachment; stdcall;
  end;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Create a client of this Soap server to invoke all three methods.</li>
<li>Everything should work happily at this point, ie.  the client can invoke all 3 methods and the server could response to all these successfully.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Now, I remove the Subtract function in the server, but still using the original client.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Invoking both Add and TestRequest still complete successfully.</li>
<li>However, after I invoke the non-exist Subtract function, TestRequest will not work anymore but the Add function still work. </li>
<li>The TestRequest will have all the problem I describe above, ie. the server still response to it, but it cant get access to the TSOAPAttachment object.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any advise is appreciated.</p>

<p>For example, in this algorithm I loop through an array to see which GraphicsDevice in the array matches the GraphicsDevice that is currently in use. It sets a value of the non-matching elements to false, and a value of the matching element to true.</p>

<p><strong>How would I express this functionally?</strong> Or, are some things better expressed proceduraly? The method I came up with 1) doesn't work because forEach returns void, and even if it did work, it feels unnatural compared to the enhanced for loop being used in my ""procedural version"" of the algorithm.</p>

    GraphicsDevice current = frame.getGraphicsConfiguration().getDevice();

    for (Monitor m : monitors)

    monitors.stream()
    //  .forEach(a -&gt; a.setCurrent(false)) # Impossible. Returns void.

If we could download the jars once and never again into a shared cache, that would speed things up wonderfully.</p>

<p>It would seem our WebDAV repo would fit the bill.  The only issue I can think of is SBT's lock file, which <em>should</em> prevent contention between multiple builds, though I'm not sure if that works on a shared drive (<a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/simple-build-tool/KUb4B9YLRCg"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> suggests maybe not).  Might there be other issues that might catch us up?</p>

<p>An alternative might be to use our Cloudbees Artifactory server as a proxy for third-party jars, then mount Artifactory via WebDAV, though that sounds more complicated, and <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/concept.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> suggests Ivy might still copy files from WebDAV to its cache (which is still better than downloading to the cache).</p>

<pre><code>public static String convertDate(long dateInMilliseconds,String dateFormat) {
        return DateFormat.format(dateFormat, dateInMilliseconds).toString();

<p>For example when im scrolling really quickly and i get to the bottom, I should have to pull for at least 1 or 2 full seconds before the mechanism realizes i want to refresh.  However even if i pull it for like .2 seconds, the mechanism loads more.</p>

<p>I don't know if my question makes sense, but basically i'm wondering if there's a way to alter the code in ego table view pull refresh to not refresh unless i pull up for a longer period of time </p>

<pre><code>@Configuration
public class ACLConfig {

    @Autowired
    DataSource dataSource;


    @Bean
    JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate() {
        return new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);
    }

    @Bean
    DataSourceTransactionManager transactionManager() {
        return new DataSourceTransactionManager(dataSource);
    }

    @Bean
    EhCacheBasedAclCache aclCache() {
        EhCacheFactoryBean factoryBean = new EhCacheFactoryBean();
        EhCacheManagerFactoryBean cacheManager = new   EhCacheManagerFactoryBean();
        cacheManager.setAcceptExisting(true);
      cacheManager.setCacheManagerName(CacheManager.getInstance().getName());
        cacheManager.afterPropertiesSet();

        factoryBean.setName(""aclCache"");
        factoryBean.setCacheManager(cacheManager.getObject());
        factoryBean.setMaxBytesLocalHeap(""16M"");
        factoryBean.setMaxEntriesLocalHeap(0L);
        factoryBean.afterPropertiesSet();
        return new EhCacheBasedAclCache(factoryBean.getObject());
    }

    @Bean
    LookupStrategy lookupStrategy() {
        return new BasicLookupStrategy(dataSource, aclCache(),  aclAuthorizationStrategy(), new ConsoleAuditLogger());
    }

    @Bean
    AclAuthorizationStrategy aclAuthorizationStrategy() {
        return new AclAuthorizationStrategyImpl(new  SimpleGrantedAuthority(""ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN""),
        new SimpleGrantedAuthority(""ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN""),
        new SimpleGrantedAuthority(""ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN""));
    }

    @Bean
    JdbcMutableAclService aclService() {
        JdbcMutableAclService service = new     JdbcMutableAclService(dataSource, lookupStrategy(), aclCache());
        service.setClassIdentityQuery(""select currval(pg_get_serial_sequence('acl_class', 'id'))"");
        service.setSidIdentityQuery(""select currval(pg_get_serial_sequence('acl_sid', 'id'))"");
        return service;
    }

    @Bean
    AclEntryVoter aclDeleteVoter()
    {
        AclEntryVoter voter = new   AclEntryVoter(aclService(),""ACL_NOMCITY_DELETE"", new Permission[]  {BasePermission.DELETE});
        voter.setProcessDomainObjectClass(NomCity.class);
        return voter;
    }

    @Bean
    AclEntryVoter aclUpdateVoter()
    {
        return new AclEntryVoter(aclService(),""ACL_NOMCITY_UPDATE"", new   Permission[]{BasePermission.ADMINISTRATION});
    }

    @Bean
    AclEntryVoter aclReadVoter()
    {
        return new AclEntryVoter(aclService(),""ACL_NOMCITY_READ"", new   Permission[]{BasePermission.READ});
    }

    @Bean
    AccessDecisionManager accessDecisionManager (){

        List&lt;AccessDecisionVoter&lt;? extends Object&gt;&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
        list.add(aclDeleteVoter());
        list.add(aclReadVoter());
        list.add(aclUpdateVoter());
        return new AffirmativeBased(list);
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I have the following RestController's methods, it use the ACLs defined earlier:</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value = ""/nomCitys"",
        method = RequestMethod.POST,
        produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
@Timed
@Transactional
@Secured({""ROLE_ADMIN"",""ROLE_USER""})
public ResponseEntity&lt;NomCity&gt; create(@Valid @RequestBody NomCity nomCity) throws URISyntaxException {

    NomCity result = nomCityRepository.save(nomCity);

    User user = (User) SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getPrincipal();
    ObjectIdentity oi = new ObjectIdentityImpl(NomCity.class,result.hashCode());
    MutableAcl acl = mutableAclService.createAcl(oi);

    acl.insertAce(0, BasePermission.ADMINISTRATION, new GrantedAuthoritySid(""ROLE_ADMIN""), true);
    acl.insertAce(1, BasePermission.DELETE, new PrincipalSid(user.getUsername()), true); 
    acl.insertAce(2, BasePermission.READ, new GrantedAuthoritySid(""ROLE_USER""), true);

    mutableAclService.updateAcl(acl);

    return ResponseEntity.created(new URI(""/api/nomCitys/"" + result.getId()))
            .headers(HeaderUtil.createEntityCreationAlert(""nomCity"", result.getId().toString()))
            .body(result);
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I create a new city the following ACL entries are created too:</p>

<ul>
<li>The user with ROLE_ADMIN role have Admin permission.</li>
<li>The user how create the city have Delete permission.</li>
<li>The user with ROLE_USER role can read the city.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following method is the delete method:</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value = ""/nomCitys/{id}"",
        method = RequestMethod.DELETE,
        produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
@Timed
@Transactional
@Secured(""ACL_NOMCITY_DELETE"")
public ResponseEntity&lt;Void&gt; delete(@PathVariable Long id) {

    nomCityRepository.delete(id);

    ObjectIdentity oid = new ObjectIdentityImpl(NomCity.class,id);
    mutableAclService.deleteAcl(oid, true);

    return ResponseEntity.ok().headers(HeaderUtil.createEntityDeletionAlert(""nomCity"", id.toString())).build();
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I create a new city all work fine, the ACL entries are created and stored in the data base, but when I go to remove a city I get a 403, although I'm logging with the user who created the city,  reviewing some pages I saw the following xml entry:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;security:global-method-security
  secured-annotations=""enabled"" access-decision-manager  ref=""customAccessDecisionManager"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I suppose that it register the AccessDecisionManager but I don't know how do the same using Java Config and I don't if it's the reason of all my problems.</p>

I've found examples (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/pdfrw/wiki/ExampleTools"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/pdfrw/wiki/ExampleTools</a>) using pdfrw and reportlab to turn pages from one pdf into pages of a new pdf, but I don't want them to be entire pages of my new pdf, just a figure occupying a section of the page.

    }

In soap URL  tried to insert data's in SQL server, i did a toast when internet is not connected and if its connected it insert the data and ""Register data"" toast  message will be displayed.

    It's checking WiFi connection if exists it toasts the message""reg successfully""
    and if not have a WiFi it toasts both message(including reg message also.).

    But in my case the both toasted has been displayed when internet is off.

<p>In my code I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>// General configuration settings for production usage
app.configure(function () {
  app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 3000);
  app.set('sslport', process.env.SSLPORT || 4000);
  ...
}

http.createServer(app).listen(app.get('port'), function () {
  winston.info('Express server listening on port ' + app.get('port'));
});

var options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('cert.pem')
};

https.createServer(options, app).listen(app.get('sslport'), function () {
  winston.info('Express server listening on port ' + app.get('sslport'));
});
</code></pre>

<p>Which works perfectly fine for a local running node server.</p>

<p>However, I want to publish my site to a cloud hosted provider like Azure Web Sites, Heroku, Nodejitsu, etc.</p>

<p>All of the cloud hosts seem to set a <code>process.env.PORT</code> value, but only the one. When my HTTPS server is created this usually results in the app crashing, as the PORT is already in use / access denied / etc.</p>

<p>So how do I create / host a site with a secure login page with only one port to work with!?</p>

"11805543","1","11805582","","2012-08-04 02:54:32","","2","3750","<p>Part of the app I'm working on involves a UIPageViewController, where each page displays an 'entry' that is stored in Core Data.  An entry includes, among other things, some images that are being compressed and stored as NSData.  Thus, to load these images and display them on a page, I'm using imageWithData, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>photo.image = [UIImage imageWithData:entry.photo];
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that imageWithData is not particularly quick, and so flipping through pages is not as responsive as I would like.  My best attempt at remedying this situation has been to preload a number of the view controllers that are displayed by my UIPageViewController into an array. (Not sure if that's the best thing to do, but there you have it)</p>

<p>So, to clarify, I have a navigation controller, which contains viewControllerA, which then links to viewControllerB - which displays the UIPageView and the entryControllers (one entryController on each page).  The problem is that when I use the navigation bar to go back from viewControllerB to viewControllerA, I want viewControllerB's array of entryControllers to be released from memory.  But, ARC doesn't seem to be doing so.  Therefore, after going back and forth between viewControllerA and viewControllerB a few times, turning a few pages each time, I start to get memory warnings - which ends up clearing the current array of entryControllers, and defeats the purpose of having that array, since the entries then have to be reloaded every time I get a memory warning. </p>

<p>In short, ARC isn't clearing any of the memory I've allocated for viewControllerB when I go back to viewControllerA via my navigation controller.  I don't like that.  If anyone could suggest a reason that this is happening, or let me know if I'm going about this whole thing the wrong way, it would be hugely appreciated.  I'm just trying to speed up the transition from one page to the next!</p>

<p>Thanks a bunch.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""section hidden""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""section-legend""&gt;My Section&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When you click anywhere on the entire div, it should remove class <code>hidden</code>.  The box then looks expanded.  Now that the box is not of class <code>hidden</code> it should not be clickable.</p>

<p>Instead, when you click the <code>div.section-legend</code> it should add class <code>hidden</code> to the main div again.  Obviously the click event for the legend needs to stopPropagation(). Now the legend should not be clickable anymore and once again you must click the entire div to open it.</p>

<p>I can't get anything to work properly, and I know this is stupid code:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

    $('.section.hidden').click(function() {
        $(this).removeClass('hidden');
        $(this).find('.section-legend').click(function(e) {

<p>I then have another viewController called <code>mapTabBarController</code> which when the user clicks on a button I call this code</p>

<pre><code>[[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:YES];
[self.navigationController setNavigationBarHidden:YES];    
locationTableView = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@""LocationTableViewController""];
[self.view addSubview:locationTableView.view];
</code></pre>

<p>I disable the <code>status bar</code> and the <code>navigation bar</code> as the <code>location view</code> is a direct overlay on the screen but still displays our <code>mapTabBar</code></p>

<p>I am working with the cancel button currently, which really just hides the <code>locationTableView</code> and turns the navigationbar and the status bar back to being displayed.  I originally tried to get this working just the standard way of having </p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)cancelButtonPressed:(id)sender {
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden: NO];
    [self.view removeFomSuperview];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This worked, but then I couldn't figure out how to get the navigationBar to re-display.  So I thought of creating a delegate to do it, so I began working on that:</p>

<p>LocationTableViewController.h</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;
@class LocationTableViewController;
@protocol LocationTableViewControllerDelegate;

@interface LocationTableViewController : UIViewController

    @property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UITableView *locationTableView;
    - (IBAction)cancelButtonPressed:(id) sender;
    @property (strong, nonatomic) id&lt;LocationTableViewControllerDelegate&gt;delegate;
@end

@protocol LocationTableViewControllerDelegate &lt;NSObject&gt;

- (void) LocationTableViewcontroller:(LocationTableViewController *)viewController cancelButtonPressed:(CGFloat)value;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>LocationTableViewController.m</p>

<pre><code>#import ""LocationTableViewController.h""

@interface LocationTableViewController ()
{
    UISearchBar *searchBar;
}
@end

@implementation LocationTableViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    [self navigationController].delegate = self;
    searchBar = [UISearchBar new];
    [searchBar setFrame: CGRectMake(8, 0, [[UIScreen mainScreen]bounds].size.width, 50)];
    [searchBar setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints:YES];
    [self.locationTableView addSubview:searchBar];
}

- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {
    [super didReceiveMemoryWarning];
    // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
}

/*
#pragma mark - Navigation

// In a storyboard-based application, you will often want to do a little preparation before navigation
- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender {
    // Get the new view controller using [segue destinationViewController].
    // Pass the selected object to the new view controller.
}
*/

- (IBAction)cancelButtonPressed:(id)sender {
    id&lt;LocationTableViewControllerDelegate&gt; strongDelegate = self.delegate;
    [strongDelegate LocationTableViewcontroller:self cancelButtonPressed:0.0f];
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>Then instantiated it in my MapTabBarController.m</p>

<pre><code>@interface MapTabBarController () &lt;FPPopoverControllerDelegate, PrivacyPopoverDelegate, UITabBarControllerDelegate, LocationTableViewControllerDelegate&gt;
@end
</code></pre>

<p>and I created the function for it:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)LocationTableViewcontroller:(LocationTableViewController *)viewController cancelButtonPressed:(CGFloat)value {
    NSLog(@""We Clicked the Cancel Button!"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Problem that I'm having with this, is that it is never called - I have no NSLog in the console.  Not sure what I've done wrong with this so need a fresh pair of eyes.</p>

I have created a global variable for the functions that manipulate this array to hold the pointer to that array so I can easily access it with the functions. However, I'm running into some problems where the pointer just...changes and isn't pointing to the right thing anymore.</p>

<p>I create the array like so:</p>

<pre><code>void initPQueue()
{
    EventPTR pQueue[qSize];
    int i;
    float t;
    for(i = 1; i &lt; qSize; i++)
    {
        t = getNextRandomInterval(getL());
        pQueue[i] = createEvent(t); 
    }

    setpQueue(pQueue);
    buildpQueue();

}
</code></pre>

<p>I use setpQueue(pQueue) to set the global variable....like so...</p>

<pre><code>void setpQueue(EventPTR* pQueue)
{
    pQueuePTR = pQueue;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The global variable is declared as: </p>

<pre><code>EventPTR* pQueuePTR;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my struct: (in my .h file.. atm)</p>

<pre><code>struct event {
    float eTime;
    double sTime;
    int status;
};

typedef struct event Event;
typedef struct event* EventPTR;
</code></pre>

<p>Everything is awesome up till this point. My buildpQueue even works right... using the pQueuePTR .... however...I went to make some test functions to just output the pQueue array and this is where it got ugly...</p>

<pre><code>void outTest()
{
    int i;
    printf(""\n\n"");
    for(i = 0; i &lt; qSize; i++)
    {
        if(pQueuePTR[i] != NULL) printf(""%f "", pQueuePTR[i]-&gt;eTime);
        else printf(""NULL "");

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This gives me output like the pointer to the array contains null values when it does not... this function and the last two are all in the same file. I even put this loop in the setpQueue and it worked fine... as it should in outTest...</p>

<p>I don't understand why this would do this... so I've come asking the experts... :)</p>

<p>Any help would be great... :)</p>

<p>I've been through <a href=""http://www.raywenderlich.com/62049/sprite-kit-tutorial-make-platform-game-like-super-mario-brothers-part-1"" rel=""nofollow"">this platforming game tutorial</a>, but I would like to use the built-in physics engine instead of making my own. I've been searching the web for days without finding a good tutorial on how to create a platforming game with jumping and movement using SpriteKit, so I decided to ask here. I've also tried many different implementations, but they all ""feel"" wrong. There's either a problem with the movement, the jumping, or most often, both. </p>

<p>So what is the best way of making a sprite move and jump on the screen? In classic platformer-game style, I want the ""camera"" to follow the sprite when moving along the x-axis. Would the best way be to change the sprite's x-value, and then immediately center the background on the sprite? Or just move the background? And how do I get nice dynamic movement? Right now it feels very heavy, and the physics engine interferes with the movement when jumping and moving forward/backward simultaneously. And how do I go about the jumping? I want only single-jumps, with a set jump-height. However, when the sprite touches the ground the first time, I want to be able to perform a second jump (even when it's bouncing), and get to the same height. </p>

<p>What I have right now is this: The screen is divided in three parts, the leftmost is for moving back, the middle is for jumping, and the rightmost is for moving forward. When tapping either side, I set a <strong>bool</strong> <strong>_movingForward/_movingBackward</strong> to the appropriate value. In the <strong>update-loop</strong> I change the <strong>sprites forward/backward velocity</strong> by adding/declining the <strong>dx velocity by +/- 15</strong>. If the velocity is greater than a <strong>maxVelocity</strong>, I set it to that <strong>max velocity</strong>. Then I set the sprites velocity by</p>

<pre><code>_sprite.physicsBody.velocity = CGVectorMake(forwardVel, _sprite.physicsBody.velocity.dy);
</code></pre>

<p>If neither <strong>_movingForward</strong> or <strong>_movingBackward</strong> is true, I <strong>decline/increase</strong> the <strong>velocity to 0.0 by +/- 4.0 to the dx velocity</strong>, to make it come stationary. However, this feels very heavy, and I've noticed that the physics engine automatically takes away some of the velocity as if there was friction or something. Is there a better way of doing this? Preferably using only the physics engine. </p>

<p>The same goes with the jumping. When tapping the middle part of the screen, I set a <strong>bool _isJumping</strong> to YES. In the <strong>update-loop</strong>, if <strong>_isJumping</strong> is YES and the <strong>dy velocity is 0</strong>, I apply an impulse to the sprite with</p>

<pre><code>CGVectorMake(0.0f, 200.0f);
</code></pre>

<p>This feels good, but the problem is that the sprite needs to be totally stationary before I can perform a second jump. I want the sprite to be able to perform a second jump as soon as it touches the ground, even if it is bouncing a bit. However, I do not want this to cause the sprite to jump higher than last time.</p>

<p>I know my question is very broad, but some basic code-examples to what my update-loop should look like, and some tips regarding what built-in methods and functions I could use to achieve this effect would be greatly appreciated! I'm pretty new to gamedev so I'm sorry if this is very basic. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance!  :)</p>

My system now exposes these sparql-endpoints:<br></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I dont get the desired output. The output is:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I´m pretty sure that this SPARQL query is correct; I also didnt notice any problems upon installing the sparqpl-plugin, so I have no idea why I get ""null"" as result. Ive tried looking for a solution via google, but I didnt find anything helpful. How can I fix this ?
Im using the <strong>Community-Edition of Neo4j 1.9.2 running on Windows 7</strong>
The version of the installed sparql plugin is ""0.2 SNAPSHOT""<br><br><br>
<strong>EDIT 1:</strong> If I run this query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ?x WHERE {?x ?y ?z} LIMIT 0
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<pre><code>{""query"":""SELECT ?x WHERE {?x ?y ?z} LIMIT 0""}

Content-Length 3
Content-Type application/json; charset=UTF-8
Access-Control-Allow-Origin *

-----

</code></pre>

<p>Maybe this helps at finding the error.</p>

<p>I´ve also tried running queries from the HTTP Console of Neo4j:</p>

<pre><code>http&gt; POST http://localhost:7474/db/data/ext/SPARQLPlugin/graphdb/execute_sparql {""query"":""select ?x where { graph ?g { ?x ?y ?z } }""}

==&gt; 200 OK
==&gt; null
</code></pre>

<p><br><br>
<strong>EDIT 2:</strong>
I´ve tried to re-download and build the plugin. Afterwards I installed it, by unzipping it at NEO4J_HOME/plugins/sparql. Then, after I started Neo4j.bat, I executed my java-code. The following error came up at the console:</p>

<p>I´ve found, that ""com.tinkerpop.blueprints.impls.neo4j.Neo4jGraph"" is part of some ""blueprints-neo4j-graph.jar"". This jar-file was missing in my sparql/ folder, so I searched for the most recent jar file and added ""blueprints-neo4j-graph-2.5.0-20130916.151744-5.jar"".

<strong>EDIT 3:</strong> Ive also tried coying some parts of the ""BerlinDatasetTest.java"" from the github page of the neof4 sparql-plugin and running it manually (ofc after adding all necessary jar files). This is the source code:</p>

I've been on this for a day or two and simply cannot figure out a correct way of completing this.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>A summary of the tasks so far:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Build the game of pangolins, where the computer stores the questions and objects in a tree structure. The game works as follows: You think of an object and the computer tries to guess what you are thinking of by asking you a series of 'yes/no' questions. If the computer guesses correctly, it wins. If you manage to fool it, you win, but you must then provide the computer with a question that would allow it to guess correctly next time round. That's all there is to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example of the tree structure you end up with (from left->right):</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>                Tree
                /
        Is it made of wood?
                \
                Grass
        /
Is it green?
        \
                Pangolin
                /
        Does it have a legs?
                \
                                Computer
                                /
                        Is it larger than a microwave?
                                \
                                Laptop
                        /
                Does it have a keyboard?
                        \
                        Desk
</code></pre>

<p>Where this is made of the following struct:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct node {
  char* object_name; // object-name (which may be NULL)
  char* question; // question (which may be NULL) 

  struct node *yesNode; // where if yes (NULL)
  struct node *noNode; // where if no (NULL)
} node;
</code></pre>

<p>Where the above tree is stored as the following file:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>Is it green?
Does it have a legs?
Does it have a keyboard?
        Desk
Is it larger than a microwave?
        Laptop
        Computer
        Pangolin
Is it made of wood?
        Grass
        Tree
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>The bonus is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make your program take an arbitrary number of input files, and graft
  them together to make a huge tree. Swap your files with your friends
  and get a huge collection of pointless questions. To do this properly
  you need to scan for duplicate entries (you won't be able to do this
  perfectly, but it should at least weed out obvious duplicates and
  graft the trees together in sensible ways.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or summarised:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take your two tree structs (or files representing tree structs) and merge them together to produce a larger tree, while removing duplicates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>How is it possible to remove two unsorted trees?</li>
<li>Is it even possible to remove duplicates without manually checking every node?</li>
<li>How do you even loop to the bottom of every node and compare that to the other tree?</li>
</ol>

<p>My best idea:</p>

<ol>
<li>Search the second tree for objects that are in the first tree also   </li>
<li>Replace those objects with pangolin object</li>
<li>Find all occurrences of pangolin in the first</li>
<li>Point the parent to the top of the second tree instead</li>
</ol>

<p>But this breaks the tree structure, and potentially makes the game break (say the top question in the first tree was is it red) and the second tree was attached on the no node and all the items in the second tree were red?</p>

<p>My main questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you have any idea as to how you would solve this? Or a hack that would kind of work? </li>
<li>How do you even find duplicates in two trees?</li>
<li>How do you attach the trees together?</li>
<li>How do you loop through the bottom of each tree?</li>
</ul>

1)To allow users to embed an image with each ID in an Excelsheet, For Ex: there will be one ID column(1,2,3...n) and one Photo Coloumn. User has to embed one photo to each row in his local system</p>

<p>2) After Step 1, User will upload this excel sheet. In Back-end I will process that uploaded excel sheet via PHPExcel API</p>

<p>3) During process, I will find the ID and the uploaded image object, I will then enter into DB the ID and uploaded image object URL.</p>

<p>Note: In Excel sheet, its the image object, not the URL, So Somehow I have to upload those images also while Excel-sheet uploading</p>

So I thought I'd ask for some help and hopefully someone out there has done this before.</p>

<p>I want to simply bind my OpenAccess entities to a RadGrid, but I want to use TemplateColumn in my RadGrid (in editmode, I want to use other controls like datepickers, dropdowns, etc.)  Therefore, like the old way of doing things, I want to fire off the RadGrid's ItemDataBound event, for example, find the controls and set the controls to the appropriate values.</p>

<p>Old way that we were used to (You know, like the old fashioned way of something like setting a RadTextBox to a value from the RadGrid's DataSource, which was a DataReader:): </p>

<pre><code>string strID = e.Item.OwnerTableView.DataKeyValues[e.Item.ItemIndex][""campaignID""].ToString(); 
RadTextBox rtxtTitle = (RadTextBox)e.Item.FindControl(""rtxtTitle""); 
rtxtTitle.Text = DataBinder.Eval(e.Item.DataItem, ""title"").ToString();
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone have sample out there of how to do this?  I would assume that I would also need to know how to bind the RadGrid in the first place, so an example of that would also be helpful (NOT using the actual OpenAccessDataSource control - I want to bind it in the NeedDataSource event of the RadGrid).</p>

I thought Reference Classes might help, but using <code>mcapply</code> to modify them doesn't seem to work.</p>

<p>The function modifies the object itself, so I overwrite the original object with the new one.  Since the object is a list and I'm only modifying a small part of it, I was hoping that R's copy-on-modify semantics would avoid having multiple copies made; however, in running it, it doesn't seem to be the case for what I'm doing.  Here's a small example of the base R methods I have been using.  It correctly resets the balance to zero.</p>

<pre><code>## make a list of accounts, each with a balance
## and a function to reset the balance
foo &lt;- lapply(1:5, function(x) list(balance=x))
reset1 &lt;- function(x) {x$balance &lt;- 0; x}
foo[[4]]$balance
## 4 ## BEFORE reset
foo &lt;- mclapply(foo, reset1)
foo[[4]]$balance
## 0 ## AFTER reset
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that using Reference Classes might help as they are mutable, and when using <code>lapply</code> it does do as I expect; the balance is reset to zero.</p>

<pre><code>Account &lt;- setRefClass(""Account"", fields=list(balance=""numeric""),
                       methods=list(reset=function() {balance &lt;&lt;- 0}))

foo &lt;- lapply(1:5, function(x) Account$new(balance=x))
foo[[4]]$balance
## 4
invisible(lapply(foo, function(x) x$reset()))
foo[[4]]$balance
## 0
</code></pre>

<p>But when I use <code>mclapply</code>, it doesn't properly reset.  Note that if you're on Windows or have <code>mc.cores=1</code>, <code>lapply</code> will be called instead.</p>

<pre><code>foo &lt;- lapply(1:5, function(x) Account$new(balance=x))

<p>When I try to make the icon vertical aligned by assigning <code>line-height: 50px</code> to the i-element, which is the same height as the outer div has, the outer div gets stretched to 55px. And I don't know why.</p>

But I would like to be able to update an entry also, but that I cant find any help about.
The demo that is supplied with the controls has the option, but I don't want to load all entries from the calendar and select the one to edit there. I want to save some sort of entryID that it is given and use that to update.
DevExpress has an option that lets you sync a table to and from Outlook calendar (works very nice) so I think it should be possible to do with TMS</p>

I enabled a child device of the GPMC node in the device tree, which probes my driver, and in there I call <code>ioremap_nocache()</code> with the resource provided by the device tree node to get an uncached region.</p>

<p>The reason I'm requesting no cache is that it's not an actual memory device which is connected to the GPMC bus, which would of course benefit from the processor cache, but an FPGA device. So accesses need to always go through the actual wires.</p>

<p>When I do this:</p>

<pre><code>u16 __iomem *addr = ioremap_nocache(...);

iowrite16(1, &amp;addr[0]);
iowrite16(1, &amp;addr[1]);
iowrite16(1, &amp;addr[2]);
iowrite16(1, &amp;addr[3]);
ioread16(&amp;addr[0]);
ioread16(&amp;addr[1]);
ioread16(&amp;addr[2]);
ioread16(&amp;addr[3]);
</code></pre>

<p>I see the 8 accesses are done on the wires using a logic analyzer. However, when I do this:</p>

<pre><code>u16 v;

addr[0] = 1;
addr[1] = 1;
addr[2] = 1;
addr[3] = 1;
v = addr[0];
v = addr[1];
v = addr[2];
v = addr[3];
</code></pre>

<p>I see the four write accesses, but not the subsequent read accesses.</p>

<p>Am I missing something? What would be the difference here between <code>ioread16()</code> and a direct memory access, knowing that the whole GPMC range is supposed to be addressable just like memory?</p>

<p>Could this behaviour be the result of any compiler optimization which can be avoided? I didn't look at the generated instructions yet, but until then, maybe someone experienced enough has something interesting to reply.</p>

<p>I want to load these into an <code>Ext.tree.Panel</code>. For now, I've defined a data store that mimics a typical response from the service. You can play with a demo JSFiddle <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/2nqAh/7/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Code included below as well:</p>

<pre><code>Ext.define('Thing', {
    extend: 'Ext.data.Model',
    fields: ['id', 'name'],
});

var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.TreeStore', {
    model: 'Thing',

    // example service response (in reality, this would be JSON)
    root: {
        children: [
            {
                id: 1,
                name: 'Thing 1',
            },
            {
                id: 2,
                name: 'Thing 2',
            },
            {
                id: 3,
                name: 'Thing 3',
            },
        ],
    },

    listeners: {
        append: function(thisNode, newChildNode, index, eOpts) {
            if( !newChildNode.isRoot() ) {
                newChildNode.set('text', newChildNode.get('name'));
            }
        },
    },
});

Ext.create('Ext.tree.Panel', {
    renderTo: Ext.getBody(),
    store: store,
    rootVisible: false,
});
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the service only returns a Thing's <code>id</code> and <code>name</code>, no tree node information like <code>children</code> or <code>leaf</code>, which is what an <code>Ext.data.TreeStore</code> normally expects. </p>

<p>I simply cannot change what the service returns as a response. I like that I can call the service and get a flat array of Things, without extraneous tree node information. There are many apps talking to this service that simply do not need such data, and I don't have permission from the powers-that-be to change it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, without the <code>children</code> element defined for each Thing in the response, Ext raises the following error when I attempt to expand a node (you can produce this yourself in the JSFiddle):</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'indexOf' of undefined 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>So, my question is:</strong> how can I avoid having to send back <code>children</code> (or <code>leaf</code>) in my response and resolve this error? I'd simply like my Things to be loaded into the tree and to be expandable (yes, they can't be leaves).</p>

<p>I'm working with Kendo UI, and it has built in functionality to change say a k-button on activation (k-button:active) however I have a few buttons that aren't only k-buttons, they are k-scheduler-update and k-scheduler-cancel. The issue is I need to remove the ""orange-on-click"" from all buttons across my project. The k-buttons were easy enough; the scheduler-update and scheduler-cancel are not as easy. I don't know if there is something built in such as the :active (that specifically didn't work) that I don't know of, but I haven't been able to find it, either.</p>

<p>In addition, I have two other locations that have k-buttons that are object other than k-buttons as well; they are .k-multiselect-wrap li. Their coloring is fine except when in Chrome if you click-hold and drag the button away, the original button turns orange and stays orange until you let go. That needs to go away as well, and I am having a difficult time with that, also.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what other specifics are needed; I'm working with Kendo UI, jquery, javascript, java, and jsp. Thanks for any help offered.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>This was copied/pasted from another css to the relevant css.</p>

<pre><code>.k-secondary .k-button:active
{
    border-color:#e6e6e6;
    box-shadow: none;
    background-color: #505050;
    color: white;
    text-shadow: none;
    text-decoration: none;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this was found online and added to the other relevant css.</p>

<pre><code>.k-multiselect-wrap li 
{
margin: 1px 0 1px 1px;
padding: .1em .15em .1em .4em;
line-height: 1.5em;
float: left;
border-color:#e6e6e6;
box-shadow: none;
background-color: #e6e6e6;
color: black;
text-shadow: none;
text-decoration: none;

}
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Just an FYI; I was not able to find a way to edit these css settings. I am however implementing a workaround in the project; I just wanted to let anyone who reads this know. I am changing the Kendo UI template to erase any instance of the color orange, which does have the caveat of adding other small style changes, but at this time it is satisfactory.</p>

For a detailed explanation of HTTP request methods see <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC 2616</a>, especially Section 5.1.1 and Section 9.</em></p>

<p>The usual way to request a resource (URI, URL, web page) is the GET method (or HEAD if you only want the headers).</p>

<p>Usually, the POST method is only used if data, that is sent by the client to the server, should not appear in the URI. Account names and passwords, or other sensitive form data, are often transmitted this way. (Of course, you'd still need SSL, as this alone provides no encryption.)</p>

<p>Most of my resources (URIs) do not need the POST method. For example, pages that contain my articles should be retrieved by GET. Examples of proper request lines:</p>

<pre><code>GET /myarticles HTTP/1.1
GET /copyrightnotice HTTP/1.1
GET /blog/2011/03/14/something.html HTTP/1.1
</code></pre>

<p>The only ones that need POST are login pages (where the account and password that have been entered into a form are sent in the POST body) and certain other special pages. Examples:</p>

<pre><code>POST /performlogin HTTP/1.1
POST /formtarget HTTP/1.1
POST /savevote HTTP/1.1
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, should I disallow the POST method on pages that do not need it (like /myarticles, /copyrightnotice, etc)?</p>

<p>In other words, if I get this request line:</p>

<pre><code>POST /blog/2011/03/14/something.html HTTP/1.1
</code></pre>

<p>should I</p>

<p>a) send a 405 (Method not allowed) error code back, together with an Allow: header, like this:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
Allow: GET, HEAD
Date: ...
</code></pre>

<p>b) -OR- should I simply treat the POST request as if it was a GET request?</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: ...

HTML-content-here
</code></pre>

<p>Does it matter, or is it completely up to me? Are there any caveats/security risks when using option b)? I'm trying to stay as much standards compliant as possible.</p>

<p>I am working on setting up a sensitivity analysis. I am working with 40 parameters that range from 0.1 - 1. My analysis requires simultaneously varying these parameters by +-0.1 roughly ~500 times. These values will then be fed into an ArcGIS tool. So, I need 500 sets of random values, for 40 parameters. These parameter values will then be compared to the output of the tool, to see which parameters the model is the most sensitive to. I've set up an Excel sheet that will randomly calculate these values each time it's opened, but the issue is that they need to be in .dbf format to be read by the ArcGIS tool.</p>

<p>I have set up a while loop (for 10 iterations to start, but will need to be ~500) and tried two different methods, in hopes that I could automate the process of calling the .xls to generate random numbers, and then exporting it to .dbf. </p>

<p>The first, arcpy.CopyRows_management correctly exported to .dbf. The issue was that the output was the exact same for each iteration, and instead of having values of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 etc, it contained values of 0.22, 0.37, 0.68 etc. It wasn't to the tenths, even though that was specified in the formulas in the .xls. </p>

<p>I also tried arcpy.TabletoTable_conversion but that was throwing the ERROR 999999: Error executing function. </p>

<p>I am open to all kinds of suggestions. Perhaps there is an easier way to randomly sample and export results to .dbf in Python. This does not need to be done using arcpy, but that is all I've really worked with. I really appreciate any help that is provided! Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>After doing everything told there, android throws an exception when it tries to inflate the fragment</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unable to instantiate fragment moviehall.client.android.views.fragments.AllMoviesView: make sure class name exists, is public, and has an empty constructor that is public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After some research, all places I found implied the problem was in the java not detecting the namespaces in uppercase, but as you can see in the error, it is correctly cased. What am I missing?</p>

<p>Here's the code I use to inflate the fragments:</p>

<pre><code>public override Fragment GetItem(int position)
{
    var frag = Fragments.ElementAt(position);
    var fragment = Fragment.Instantiate(_context,
        FragmentJavaName(frag.FragmentType));
    ((MvxFragment)fragment).DataContext = frag.ViewModel;
    return fragment;
}
</code></pre>

<p>here's the FragmentInfo class</p>

<pre><code>public class FragmentInfo
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public Type FragmentType { get; set; }
    public IMvxViewModel ViewModel { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the method i use to put convert the namespaces to lowercase</p>

<pre><code>protected virtual string FragmentJavaName(Type fragmentType)
{
    var namespaceText = fragmentType.Namespace ?? """";

First, I am trying to run the example in the manual.</p>

<p>Rsundials can be used to solve the ODEs when the right hand side of the ODEs is described in a C file. </p>

<p>First, the ODEs are described in a C file (example program from the package)</p>

<pre><code>#include ""include/nvector/nvector_serial.h""
#include ""include/sundials/sundials_dense.h""
#define Ith(v,i) ( NV_DATA_S(v)[i - 1] )

int rhs(realtype t, N_Vector y, N_Vector ydot, void *f_data){
       realtype y1, y2, y3;
       y1 = Ith(y,1); y2 = Ith(y,2); y3 = Ith(y,3);
       /* Change values of ydot here using Ith(ydot,i) */

       double L = 49.3;
       double a21 = 0.011; double a12 = 0.012;
       double a31 = 0.0039; double a13 = 0.000035;
       double a01 = 0.021; double a02 = 0.016;
       Ith(ydot, 1) = -(a01 + a21 + a31)*y1 + a12*y2 + a13*y3 + L;
       Ith(ydot, 2) = a21*y1 - (a02 + a12)*y2;
       Ith(ydot, 3) = a31*y1 - a13*y3; 
       return(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>saved in a file <code>test_rsundials.c</code>. The file is then compiled using the following command in the terminal</p>

<pre><code>R CMD SHLIB ./test_rsundials.c
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The file compiles without any error message</strong> and I see <code>test_rsundials.so</code> and <code>test_rsundials.o</code> in my directory being generated.</p>

<p>Then I use the <code>dyn.load</code> to load the package - </p>

<pre><code>dyn.load(""/ .. path .. /test_rsundials.so"")
</code></pre>

<p>No error message in the step above also, finally I call the cvode solver using the following commands (as shown in the manual of the package)</p>

<pre><code>library(Rsundials)
vals  &lt;- cvodes(c(0.0,0.0,0.0), seq(0,400,20),""test_rsundials"",""rhs"",rtol=1e-4,atol=c(1e-8,1e-14,1e-6),verbose=T)
</code></pre>

<p>This generates the error -</p>

<pre><code>Error in .Call(""cvodes"", PACKAGE = ""Rsundials"", as.double(y), as.double(times),  : 
  ""cvodes"" not available for .Call() for package ""Rsundials""
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried the following command</p>

<pre><code>yvals  &lt;- .Call(""cvodes"",package=""Rsundials"",c(0.0,0.0,0.0), seq(0,400,20),""test_rsundials"",""rhs"",rtol=1e-4,atol=c(1e-8,1e-14,1e-6),verbose=T)
</code></pre>

<p>which gives me the error</p>

<pre><code>Error in .Call(""cvodes"", package = ""Rsundials"", c(0, 0, 0), seq(0, 400,  : 
  C symbol name ""cvodes"" not in load table

<p>I read that this might be 64-bit v/s 32-bit compilation issue, I am not sure how I can specify compilation in 64-bit flag. I am a newbie at both R and C, so any help will be much appreciated!!</p>

<p><strong>Posting an update --</strong> I read that this error might be due to linking with library issues. I looked at the <a href=""https://github.com/cran/Rsundials/tree/master/src"" rel=""nofollow"">src</a> folder of this package, and the there is a file <code>Makevars.old</code> which implies that I might need to link with the libraries</p>

<pre><code>PKG_CFLAGS=-w

PKG_LIBS=-L. -lsundials_cvodes -lsundials_ida -lsundials_fida -lsundials_nvecserial
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NOTE - The package manual says that ""Installation of SUNDIALS is not a prerequisite for the package"".</strong>  So I have stuck all the files in <code>src</code> folder of this package in my project folder (so hopefully there are no file not found errors).</p>

<p>Now I tried to compile with the following commands in the terminal</p>

<pre><code>export PKG_CFLAGS=""-w""    
export PKG_LIBS=""-L. -lsundials_cvodes -lsundials_nvecserial""
R CMD SHLIB test_rsundials.c sundials_dense.c nvector_serial.c

<p>I have always wanted to implement dynamic references into .methods but it doesn't seem very feasible. </p>

<p>In my current program The user is presented with a dropdown menu. From the menu they select a page size (A1, B2, A3...).Then I need to do this line:</p>

<pre><code>Document document = new Document(PageSize.A4.rotate(), 50, 50, 50, 50);
</code></pre>

<p>Can I replace the A4 with a dynamic reference? Otherwise I need to call this same line in as many separate sections as there are page sizes.</p>

<p>Something like this does not seem to work: </p>

<pre><code>Rectangle f = new Rectangle();
Document document = new Document(PageSize.f.rotate(), 50, 50, 50, 50);
</code></pre>

<p>so I'm guessing this methodology is not possible. But if things can be done this way I'd love to know how. For now I'm going to set the contents of the parenthesis (PageSize.f.rotate(), 50, 50, 50, 50) as a variable and drop that in.</p>

<p>So can methods only use dynamic references when they have parenthesis to take in variables, or can dynamic references be used in .method calls as well?</p>

<li><p>Now put this new value by adding the value of <code>00:00:00</code> from same row corresponding to <code>Nos</code> in new column that will have header of <code>col[last]</code> from <code>file_1.csv</code>. i.e. <code>208+20=228</code> </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now the appended <code>file_2.csv</code> looks like:</p>

<p>I have a generic active record <code>User</code> class (which has some attributes in the <code>users</code> table), but we have a few different flavours of user. Some of these different user types have data stored in different places (for legacy reasons).</p>

<p>For example: <code>BlueUser</code> objects have their <code>email</code> attribute stored in the <code>DB.blue_users</code> table, and <code>RedUser</code> objects have their email stored in <code>DB.red_users</code>. Note that <code>blue_users</code> and <code>red_users</code> do not have the same table structure, they just both happen to have an <code>email</code>. </p>

<p>My intention is to have the generic <code>User</code> class be the only to interact with, and use composition to ""create"" the <code>User</code> objects out of their own properties and methods, in addition to the properties and methods of the composite object (Let's call it the <code>User_Record</code> object).</p>

<p>So the <code>User</code> class would have its own methods, but then at runtime as the <code>User</code> is being instantiated (perhaps via <code>after_initialize</code>), a <code>RedUser</code> or <code>BlueUser</code> object may be instantiated within <code>User</code> as the <code>User_Record</code> object. Each of the <code>User_Record</code> objects/implementations would be Active Record models themselves. I'm then hoping that something can be done so if I ask for the property <code>User.email</code>, it can be pulled from the <code>User_Record</code> object (without having to call it like <code>User.record.email</code>). </p>

<p>I've looked a little bit at <code>composed_of</code> in Rails, but am unsure how I might go about unifying the properties / methods of the two objects (so that I wouldn't have to do <code>User.record.email</code> elsewhere in the codebase).</p>

<p>I hope my explanation is clear, but if not I'd be happy to take another stab at it.</p>

I wrote a class authorization (ApprovedLaptopsAuthorization) and used it in my ModelResource (RecordResource) class. The endpoint of <code>RecordResource</code> is <a href=""http://myserver/book/api/record"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myserver/book/api/record</a>.</p>

<p>HTTP GET Request to that endpoint is working correctly. (permissions are checked in read_list() method of ApprovedLaptopsAuthorization class). Now I try to check HTTP POST Request by sending correct JSON data. The problem is that any of ApprovedLaptopsAuthorization methods (create_list(), create_detail()) does not running during that operation. As a result, I can not restrict access to create object  operation and any user can create object in any time. Where the mistake in my code?</p>

<p>Here's the code I have:</p>

<pre><code>blocksToBeRendered = (baseItem as AvgCurve).GetStreamGeometryBlocks(ActualWidth, ActualHeight, _minPoint.X, _maxPoint.X, FixTimeStep ? _timeStep : 0, IsMainChart);

Pen stroke = new Pen((baseItem as AvgCurve).LineBrush, 1);

foreach (GeometryGroup group in blocksToBeRendered)
{
    if (group.Children.Count != 0)
    {
        if (!cachedBlocks[baseItem].Any(x =&gt; x.Children[0] == group.Children[0]))
        {
            cachedBlocks[baseItem].Add(group);

            ImprovedDrawingVisual vis = new ImprovedDrawingVisual();

            BitmapCache cache = new BitmapCache() { SnapsToDevicePixels = true };
            vis.CacheMode = cache;

            using (DrawingContext context = vis.RenderOpen())
            {
                RenderOptions.SetEdgeMode(group, EdgeMode.Aliased);
                if (group.Children.Count &gt; 0)
                {
                    context.DrawGeometry(null, stroke, group.Children[0]);
                }
            }

            _host.VisualCollection.Add(vis);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the <code>ImprovedDrawingVisual</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class ImprovedDrawingVisual: DrawingVisual
{
    public ImprovedDrawingVisual()
    {
        VisualEdgeMode = EdgeMode.Aliased;
        VisualBitmapScalingMode = BitmapScalingMode.NearestNeighbor;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the geometries do have <code>Transforms</code>, which might be important.</p>

<p>What happens is that the graphs are drawn nicely without bitmap caching (1 px lines), but when I turn on bitmap caching, parts of the graph go all blurry sometimes.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/frYwK.png"" alt=""blurry lines""></p>

<p>Does anyone know how I can fix this? I tried changing the <code>RenderAtScale</code> of the <code>DrawingVisual</code> or turning off the <code>EdgeMode</code> setting, but that doesn't help.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Left out the brush fill geometry to avoid confusion since it's not relevant here.</p>

<p>In eclipse, I usually inspected the logcat output maximizing the LogCat tab (double click on the tab to maximize, and again to minimize). This is fast and can be done from either the DDMS, Java or Debug perspectives.
In Android Studio, there seems to be only one perspective, and the DDMS frame is pinned to the left bottom corner. To maximize, the only way I've found by now is to put the window into float mode (using that gear icon in the DDMS window corner) and then resize it. To minimize it again I've to click the gear icon again and disable the float mode.</p>

<p>This is too much work compared to eclipse. Is there a better way?</p>

<p>Also in the logcat window, in eclipse all the columns (Time, PID, TID, Application, Tag, Text) were displayed and resizable. However in Android Studio I can't see the column names, so I don't know what is being displayed, and there's no way to resize the columns. Is there any way of configuring the columns? All I've found in settings was the options to change the line colours according to the debug level.</p>

<p>In sample data and schema below, the values of the Name attributes in the DataElement elements are required to be unique in the XSD. XSD does this with the 'unique' element</p>

<p>Is there a way for the validation engine to apply XSD to require that those values in the Name attributes appear exactly once per document? My reason is that some of those name/value pairs are required, and I'd rather find errors sooner rather than later. XSD is ideal, declarative, simple.</p>

<p>I created a query that basically synchronizes some Active Directory user data with two tables.  It starts by creating a temporary table</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE #ADUsers ( ... )
</code></pre>

<p>Then the data is pulled from Active Directory and inserted in #ADUsers using code that was somewhat inspired by <a href=""http://www.bravesoft.com/blog/?p=24"" rel=""nofollow"">this blog post</a>.  At this point, there is a lot of unnecessary data in the temp table that includes thing like inactive/disabled and service accounts and I was having some trouble removing it from within the OPENQUERY statement, so the results were sanitized using a SELECT ... INTO statement using the WHERE clause to remove unnecessary data then put the result into another temporary table.  The final step is a merge statement, to update a ""master"" table.  </p>

<p>This query, though long and messy, works perfectly!  The next step was to make this a stored procedure and maybe create a trigger of some kind that would run the stored procedure and semi-regular intervals to keep the data up to date.  </p>

<p>When I turn it into a stored procedure and execute, however, it shows an error about unclosed quotes and incorrect syntax.</p>

<pre><code>Msg 105, Level 15, State 1, Line 3
Unclosed quotation mark after the character string 'SELECT CN, givenName, SN, objectCategory, SAMAccountName, mail, department, manager, OU, userAccountControl

Incorrect syntax near 'SELECT CN, givenName, SN, objectCategory, SAMAccountName, mail, department, manager, OU, userAccountControl
FROM 'LDAP:/'.
</code></pre>

<p>This error isn't thrown when the query is run by itself outside a stored procedure.  When put inside a stored procedure and executed, the above error is shown repeatedly.</p>

<p>I'd love to know what is causing these errors and how to fix this.  </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>For the GZIP compression, this appears to work. But I still haven't figured out how to my my HTTP Rewrites rules yet.</p>

<pre><code> gzip             on;

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>I tried replacing my htaccess rewrite rules with the following NGINX rules but this doesn't appear to work. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?</p>

<p>I've looked into the different options for audio recording and manipulation and have found it a bit confusing...digital signal processing isn't a strong point at all. I've mainly looked into OpenAL and inside the EFX library there is a filter that specifically does what I need, but EFX is not included on the iPhone. Is there a way of replicating that behaviour using OpenAL for the iPhone? Is there another option such as Audio Units that could provide a solution?</p>

<p>Thanks for your help</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>So after Tom's answer and links, I've come up with what I think is a correct implementation. However, I'm not getting a muffling effect at all, rather just a decrease in volume. Here's the (summarised) code I have currently:</p>

<p>File is recorded using AVAudioRecorder and the following settings:</p>

<pre><code>[recordSetting setValue :[NSNumber numberWithInt:kAudioFormatLinearPCM] forKey:AVFormatIDKey];
[recordSetting setValue:[NSNumber numberWithFloat:44100] forKey:AVSampleRateKey];
[recordSetting setValue:[NSNumber numberWithInt: 1] forKey:AVNumberOfChannelsKey];

[recordSetting setValue :[NSNumber numberWithInt:16] forKey:AVLinearPCMBitDepthKey];
[recordSetting setValue :[NSNumber numberWithBool:NO] forKey:AVLinearPCMIsBigEndianKey];
[recordSetting setValue :[NSNumber numberWithBool:NO] forKey:AVLinearPCMIsFloatKey];
</code></pre>

<p>I then read in the file and transform it with the code below:</p>

<pre><code>// Read in the file using AudioFileOpenURL
AudioFileID fileID = [self openAudioFile:filePath];

// find out how big the actual audio data is
UInt32 fileSize = [self audioFileSize:fileID];

// allocate the memory to hold the file
SInt16 * outData = (SInt16 *)malloc(fileSize); 

// Read in the file to outData
OSStatus result = noErr;
result = AudioFileReadBytes(fileID, false, 0, &amp;fileSize, outData);

// close off the file
AudioFileClose(fileID);

// Allocate memory to hold the transformed values
SInt16 * transformData = (SInt16 *)malloc(fileSize);

// Start the transform - Need to set alpha to 0.15 or below to have a noticeable affect
float alpha = 1;         

// Code as per Tom's example
transformData[0] = outData[0];

for(int sample = 1; sample &lt; fileSize / sizeof(SInt16); sample ++) 
{
     transformData[sample] = transformData[sample - 1] + alpha * (outData[sample] - transformData[sample - 1]);
}

// Add the data to OpenAL buffer
NSUInteger bufferID;
// grab a buffer ID from openAL
alGenBuffers(1, &amp;bufferID);

// Add the audio data into the new buffer
alBufferData(bufferID,AL_FORMAT_MONO16,transformData,fileSize,44100);
</code></pre>

<p>So after all that, I then play it through OpenAL using the standard method (I don't think it has any impact on my results so I won't include it here.)</p>

<p>I've traced through the results, both before and after transform, and they seem correct to me i.e. the values before vary positively and negatively as I would expect and the for loop is definitely flattening out those values. But as I mentioned before I'm only seeing (what seems to me) a reduction in volume, so I'm able to increase the gain and cancel out what I've just done.</p>

<p>It seems that I must be working on the wrong values. Any suggestions of what I'm doing wrong here?</p>

<p>But it also will have some customized fields in it also like missed calls or some other non native contact information,</p>

<p>Here is an example screen shot taken from the Viber application:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YXU0W.png"" alt=""Viber screenshot""></p>

<p>I am quite new to iPhone development and I was wondering if this screen is made available to developers so that a contacts information can be presented from within an application with custom fields or if it is not and has to be developed from scratch?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for the help, with it I have successfully recreated the screen in a static manner, I have one more question and that is how would I make the cell that has the outgoing calls in it react to dymanic data? </p>

<p>So for instance there could be 10 calls there, so how do I adjust the size of the cell on the fly? And also whats the best object to use to allow the calls to be displayed? At the moment I'm using a UITextView to display the static data but I dont think this will work for dynamic data?</p>

<p>The Problem I am facing is that when I want to use a property which is a list. In that case I will always get a list of JAXBElement instead of objects of the correct class.</p>

<p>Assume this given xml snipped:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;domainObjects avqxsi:type=""avqsq:AssetAllocation"" id=""100"" name=""Some Name""&gt;
    &lt;nodes&gt;101&lt;/nodes&gt;
    &lt;nodes&gt;102&lt;/nodes&gt;
  &lt;/domainObjects&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now all the ""nodes"" are ids of different domain objects of type <code>AANode</code>. So in the xsd it is defined like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsd:complexType name=""AssetAllocation""&gt;
    &lt;xsd:complexContent&gt;
      &lt;xsd:extension base=""avqsq:DomainObject""&gt;
        &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
          &lt;xsd:element ecore:reference=""avqsq:AANode"" maxOccurs=""unbounded"" name=""nodes"" type=""xsd:IDREF""/&gt;
        &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
      &lt;/xsd:extension&gt;
    &lt;/xsd:complexContent&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And I have defined some bindings.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;jaxb:bindings node=""xsd:complexType[@name='AssetAllocation']//xsd:element[@name='nodes']""&gt;
            &lt;jaxb:property&gt;
                &lt;jaxb:baseType name=""my.api.xsd.AANode""/&gt;
            &lt;/jaxb:property&gt;
        &lt;/jaxb:bindings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What I want is a POJO property like this:</p>

<pre><code>@XmlElementRef(name = ""nodes"")
protected List&lt;AANode&gt; nodes;
</code></pre>

<p>But what I actually get at <strong>runtime</strong> is a <code>List&lt;JAXBElement&lt;AANode&gt;&gt;</code> which leads into a ClassCastException.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong>
I have missed the fact that the cxf-codegen framework is generating a class where you clearly can see that the property is annotated with <code>JAXBElement.class</code> which i think is wrong. Interestingly changing the annotation by hand to AANode.class will fail with an <em>IllegalAnnotationException: AANode"" or any of its subclasses are not known to this context.</em></p>

<pre><code>public class AssetAllocation
    extends DomainObject
    implements Serializable, Equals, HashCode, ToString
{

    @XmlElementRef(name = ""nodes"", type = JAXBElement.class)
    protected List&lt;AANode&gt; nodes;

<p>For my test code. I made a Vector called Test</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;const char*&gt; Test;
</code></pre>

<p>To test the find function, I filled the Test vector with dummy data by using push_back function </p>

<pre><code>Test.push_back(""F_S"");
Test.push_back(""FC"");
Test.push_back(""ID"");
Test.push_back(""CD"");
Test.push_back(""CT"");
Test.push_back(""DS"");
Test.push_back(""CR"");
Test.push_back(""5K_2"");
Test.push_back(""10K_5"");
Test.push_back(""10K_1"");
Test.push_back(""10K_2"");
Test.push_back(""10K_3"");
Test.push_back(""10K_4"");
Test.push_back(""10K_5"");
</code></pre>

<p>What I want to do with the find function is to go through the Test and see if there are any repeated data. The first time a encounter the data, I will save it to a vector called Unique_Data.</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;const char*&gt; Unique_Data;
</code></pre>

<p>So for the 14 data points above, only 13 will be saved because 10K_5 repeated.</p>

<p>The Code I am using looks like this</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; Test.size(); i++) 
    {
        if( Unique_Data.empty())
        {
            Unique_Data.push_back(Test[i]);
        }
        else if (std::find(Unique_Data.begin(), Unique_Data.end(), Test[i]) != Unique_Data.end())
        {
            // Move on to next index
        }
        else
        {
            Unique_Data.push_back(Test[i]);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I am having is when I am using the dummy data. I am getting a correct answer for Unique_Data.</p>

<p>However, if I save the actual data into the Test vector which are saved in linked list. I get that they are all unique.</p>

<p>The code looks like this</p>

<pre><code>p_curr = List.p_root;
    while(p_curr != NULL)
    {
            // id starts from 0
        if(atoi(p_curr-&gt;id) == 14) break;
        Test.push_back(p_curr-&gt;Descriptor);

        p_curr = p_curr-&gt;p_next;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I tested with the same 14 data. They are all const char* types. However, when I used the linked list data. The find function thinks all the data is unique.</p>

<p>I am trying to initialize an application scoped managed bean using a PostConstructApplicationEvent, that is because I have an important constraint which is not to use @PostConstruct annotation since the required build tool compiles using Java 5. For this I have implemented the SystemEventListener interface in this class</p>

<pre><code>public class ApplicationListener implements SystemEventListener {

    private final static Logger LOGGER = Logger
            .getLogger(ApplicationListener.class.getName());

    public boolean isListenerForSource(Object app) {
        boolean isApp = (app instanceof Application);  
        return isApp;
    }

    public void processEvent(SystemEvent event) throws AbortProcessingException {
         try {
        if (event instanceof PostConstructApplicationEvent) {
             Application app = ((PostConstructApplicationEvent) event).getApplication();
             LOGGER.info(""PostConstructApplicationEvent is Called"");
             FacesContext context = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();
            MyBean myBean = ((PostConstructApplicationEvent) event).getApplication().evaluateExpressionGet(context,""#{myBean}"", MyBean.class);
             myBean.init();

<p>Now, for what I have begun to understand of the problem is that the ELContext has been released from the InitFacesContext and therefore it throws a NullPointerException when trying to call the getELContext() method.</p>

<p>So my question is, what am I doing wrong here? Are we supposed not to retrieve programatically Managed Beans during a PostConstructApplicationEvent? If so, why?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance on any help to shed some light into this problem.</p>

<p>I've declined to produce sample code because so far I have been unable to replicate this example on a smaller data set. I am training several logistic regressions (50 in this example) using different covariate selections and saving the output as a list. My training data has +400K rows. </p>

<p>Recognizing that there is a large amount of unnecessary background data that gets stored in glm objects, my training script involves the following lines of code, which are intended to strip out as much extra data as I can and reduce the memory footprint of the output object: </p>

<pre><code>fit[c('residuals', 'fitted.values', 'effects', 'weights', 'prior.weights', 'y', 'linear.predictors', 'data')] &lt;- NULL
fit$qr$qr &lt;- NULL
 gc() 
</code></pre>

<p>At first this seemed like it worked OK. Here's how the list of glms looks in my RStudio console after executing my code: </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ITeFg.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>However, when I save this object using <code>save(logitFire, file = 'logitFire.RData')</code> I find that it's memory footprint is absolutely massive, (1.32GBs on disk): </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/eqfsY.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Again, I 100% recognize that it is bad form not to supply a toy example. I tried using the iris dataset and was unable to reproduce the problem. It seems to be a feature of large data sets, but I'm not sure. Any experts out there have an idea of what's going on? My next step, if I can't solve this using the functions in the base package, will be to write my own wrappers for ""leanLogit"" and ""leanPredict"" functions that just strip out the model covariates and toss all the rest of the ancillary data. </p>

<p>Cheers, </p>

<p>EDIT: To clarify, the sample script that I included in this question is embedded within the model training routine that ultimately produces the list of glms <code>logitFire</code>. This is not complete code, but is embedded within a much larger script. I included it so that readers can see what data objects I'm stripping out.  </p>

<p>EDIT #2: Here's some additional requested info. To be as clear as I possibly can, <code>logitFire</code> is a list of 50 logistic regression models that I produced in R using glm. I've shown the output from the <code>str</code> command on one element of this list, i.e. one logistic regression model: </p>

<pre><code>[PetaPoco.ResultColumn]

</code></pre>

<p>Petapoco does a wonderful job by fetching my objects when I use:</p>

<pre><code>evt = db.Fetch&lt;Models.Event, Models.User&gt;("";EXEC GetEventDetails @id"", new { id = id });
</code></pre>

<p>This brings me the event, with the presenter data.</p>

<p>But the problem is that I also have a column being generated in my query 'Available seats'
This column is linked to the object as:</p>

<pre><code>[PetaPoco.ResultColumn]
public string AvailableSeats { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is: when I use the db.Fetch, Available seats is null.
My solution now is:</p>

<pre><code>evt = db.Fetch&lt;Models.Event&gt;("";EXEC GetEventDetails @id"", new { id = id })[0];
evt.Presenter = db.FirstOrDefault&lt;Models.User&gt;(""WHERE id="" + evt.PresenterId);
</code></pre>

<p>but I don't really like this. it should be all in one line of code.</p>

<p>First things first: assume you have some nicely-neat interfaces:</p>

<pre><code>class IProduct
{
public:
    virtual void DoThings();
}


enum ProductType
{
   ...
}


class IProducer
{
public:
    virtual IProduct* Produce( ProductType type );
}


class IConsumer
{
public:
    virtual void Consume( IProduct* product );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Its plain simple yet: abstract factory, abstract consumer who will invoke interface, gladly provided by those freshly-spawned IProducts.
But here comes the tricky part.
Assume that there are two ( or more ) parallel concrete groups:</p>

<pre><code>class ConcreteProducerA : public IProducer { ... }
class ConcreteConsumerA : public IConsumer { ... }
class ConcreteProductA : public IProduct { ... }

class ConcreteProducerB : public IProducer { ... }
class ConcreteConsumerB : public IConsumer { ... }
class ConcreteProductB : public IProduct { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>And those concretes are reeealy different things. Like a space-shuttle parts ( with a parts factory and a shuttle assembly line ) and bags of vegetables ( with a farm and .. idk, who whould consume those vegetables? ). Yet they have that thing in general: DoThings(). Pretend that it is, like, PackAndSend(), or Serialize(), or Dispose(), whatever you like. Nothing concrete, yet legit to base a hierarchy on.
But those still have more differences, than generalities. So those ConcreteConsumers tend to use them differently. So differently, that, in fact, they absolutely MUST be sure, that it is supposed concrete type.</p>

<p>So here is the problem: I'm forcing the users of that hierarchy to downcast IPoduct to ConcreteProduct in their virtual overrides right now. And thats bugging me hard. I feel I'm missing something: a big flaw in hierarchy, some lack of pattern knowledge, something.
I mean, I can make sure, that ConcreteConsumerB always recieves ConcreteProductB, but it's still a downcast. And would you ever use a framework, that always passes around (void*)'s and forces you to cast it to whenewer you think is gonna come at ya?</p>

<p>Solutions I've already considered:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tunnel all conctrete interfeces into IProduct. But that product gona turn into uncontrollable blob, who can Eat(), BeEaten(), Launch(), Destroy() and whoever knows what else. So this solution seems nothing better than downcasting to me.</li>
<li>That DoThings() can probably be decoupled from IProduct into another handler, which will be able to accept all of the concretes (Visitor-like). That way IProduct can be removed and there will be separate concrete groups. But what if there is a SemiConcrete layer, which imlements some common functionality for those concrete groups? Like labeling, morphing, massaging, whatever. Plus when there will be need to add another concrete group I'll be forced to change that visitor(s), which kinda increases coupling.</li>
<li><p>(ab)Use templates. That seems wise at the moment. Something along the lines of</p>

<pre><code>template &lt; typename _IProduct &gt;
class IConcreteProducer : public IProducer
{
public:
    virtual _IProduct* Produce( _IProduct::Type type ) = 0;
    virtual _IProduct::Type DeduceType( ProductType type ) = 0;
    virtual IProduct* Produce( ProductType type )
    {
        return IConcreteProducer&lt;typename _IProduct&gt;::Produce( DeduceType( type ) );
    }
}

template &lt; typename _IProduct &gt;
class IConcreteConsumer : public IConsumer
{
public:
    virtual void Consume( _IProduct* product ) = 0;
    virtual void Consume( IProduct* product )
    {
        IConcreteConsumer&lt;typename _IProduct&gt;::Consume( (_IProduct*)product );
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way I'm in control of that downcast, but it is stil present.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Anyways, does this problem sound familiar to someone? Somebody seen it solved, or maybe heroicaly solved it himself? C++ solution would be awesome, but I think any staticaly-typed language will suffice.</p>

<p>It test it on emulator and on real device (Eclair) but it doesn't work,
the Service never receive any notification.</p>

<p>I've read in detail the following thread (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2021176/android-gps-status"">here</a>) but no solution work. 
I send it in a separate question because I only want to be informed of 
GPS start and stop, not fixes.</p>

<p>Do you have any advice on this? 
May be it is because I try to do it in a Service rather that in an Activity?</p>

<pre><code>int main(void) {
   void *p=(void *)0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF;

   printf(""p      :%p\n"", p);
   printf(""p+1    :%p\n"", p+1);
   printf(""Result :%d\n"", p&lt;p+1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It returns:</p>

<pre><code>p      : 0xffffffffffffffff
p+1    : (nil)
Result : 0
</code></pre>

<p>So  I believe it is possible for this case. For an invalid pointer location it can happen.
This is the only solution I can think of. Are there others?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> 
No assumptions are made. Consider any compiler/platform/architecture/OS where there is a chance that this can happen or not. </p>

<p>I'm using jQuery v1.7.2.</p>

<p>I have a facebox box which I initiate with a hidden value so I know what value I should change on the main page when facebox is done.</p>

<p>I have this HTML code:</p>

<p><code>&lt;hidden type=""hidden"" value=""hello"" id=""testid"" name=""testname"" /&gt;</code></p>

<p>And in jQuery I've logged:</p>

<pre><code>console.log($('[name=""testname""]'));
console.log($('#testid'));
console.log($('#testid').val());
console.log($('[name=""testname""]').val());
</code></pre>

<p>And this outputs:</p>

<pre><code>[&lt;hidden type=​""hidden"" value=​""hello"" id=​""testid"" name=​""testname""&gt;​&lt;/hidden&gt;​]
[&lt;hidden type=​""hidden"" value=​""hello"" id=​""testid"" name=​""testname""&gt;​&lt;/hidden&gt;​]
(empty line)
(empty line)

<p>So why cant I access this value?</p>

<p>I'm using facebox with AJAX and I know that if I use facebox with divs it will copy the dom element so that I get two with same IDs but this shouldnt happend with AJAX? And also then I would get more elements returned on the first two lines, wouldnt I?
A strange thing is if I inspect the elements in Chrome I see that the input box has changed to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;hidden type=""hidden"" value=""hello"" id=""testid"" name=""testname""&gt;&lt;/hidden&gt;

<p>Plus action on div:hover is:</p>

<pre><code>.element:hover img.grey {
  -webkit-filter: none;
  filter: none;

  /* here should go transition */

}
</code></pre>

<p>As u can see, pointing mouse over whole DIV should trigger hover action for IMG only.</p>

<p>Problem is, that when I add transition to ""img.grey"" and "".element:hover img.grey"", cause I want it to change smoothly, the effect becomes a bit glichy. I guess it's because ""filter: none"" along with ""transition: transition_options;"" are in colflict. Filter WITH no filter at the same time :) Sometimes it goes smooth, sometimes after hover I get white background, nvm. Many glitchy effects.</p>

<p>What I tried, was to delete "".element:hover img.grey {}"" and simply add jQuery script that will toggle "".grey"" class onmouseover / onmouseout (hover). I used standard ""toggleClass()"" inside of ""$('element').hover()"" function.</p>

<p>Also sth I found on css-tricks.com:</p>

<pre><code>$('.element').hover(
       function(){ $(""img"").removeClass('grey') },
       function(){ $(""img"").addClass('grey') }
)
</code></pre>

<p>I thought that can help cause I am avoiding ""filter: none VS transition"" conflict. But both didn't work at all. Can anyone help me with it?</p>

<p>P.S. Didn't work means that there was no hover effect. After hover action images stayed in greyscale.</p>

<p>I have an app that uses Ionic Angular JS as the frontend  with multiple restful services from the backend. I am using a combination of Drupal and Yii2.  Both of the apps can support Facbook login / sign up as web apps as the modules are available.  Ionic app by itself can use FBLogin by using NGCordova.  However, I need to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Login to Ionic app using Facebook Login.</li>
<li>Using this login create an account in both my Yii2 and Drupal 7 apps.  (I can sacrifice one or the other if I really need to.  I have two backends because I need one to store the custom logic an another for the content management.). </li>
<li>User should be able to create new nodes in both of the apps.  (Yii2 will have a higher priority).     </li>
</ol>

<p>Any guidance will be great.  Eventually I may expand FB login capability to Google ID as well.</p>

<pre><code>class GamePiece

   protected GamePiece _piece;

class Chess : Game

<p>This is seriously oversimplified, but makes the actual point. Now assuming that there are events and such, I would like to attach the common ones in the base class constructor, and the specialized ones in the derived constructor. For example both a checker and a chessman might have a ""captured"" event and a ""moved"" event. I would like to attach them in the base constructor. However, events that would be specific such as ""castled"" or something like that would be attached only in the specific constructor. </p>

<p>The problem I have is that the base constructor seems to only be able to run BEFORE the derived constructor. How do I effect this such that I get to actually instantiate the ""gamepiece"" before I call the base ""Game"" constructor to attach to events. </p>

<p>My gut suggests that this is better handled by removing that functionality from the constructor and simply having an ""Attach()"" member function and handling it there. However, I want to make sure I am going in the right direction, since it would seem there should be a way to do it in the constructor. </p>

<p>The touch event:</p>

<p>I already  tried to set to nil, the color and nothing is shown, only the red line, this is correct, but the touched moved returns true where would be the yellow part....
Is it possible to delete or initialize the line.. without this section of the figure?

Point is in different @media-query the variable is rewrited. So I would like the mixin to use updated value but it doesnt seem to do it.</p>

<p>Here's whats bugging me:</p>

<pre><code>@base-font-size: 18px;
@modifier: 7;

// font size for elements that are not headings
// if I pass ""clean"" as second arg then the line-height will be same as font size
// dont focus on it - @modifier is the problem

.font(@size, @line-height) when (@line-height = clean) {
  font-size: @size;
  line-height: @size;
}

.font(@size, @line-height: true) when not (@line-height = clean) {
  font-size: @size;
  line-height: unit((@size + @modifier), px);
}

body {
  .font(@base-font-size);
}



@media (max-width: 800px) {
  @base-font-size: 18px;
  @modifier: 5;

  body {
    .font(@base-font-size);
    color: red;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It compiles into:</p>

<pre><code>body {

@media (max-width: 800px) {
  body {
    font-size: 18px;
    line-height: 25px;
    color: red;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The @modifier value in @media has changed.
If I would like to use it in @media like this: line-height: @modifier+@base-font-size then the new value would be used and everything is ok.</p>

<p>But when I want to use this new value in a mixin and use this mixin in @media - then this mixin is using old value(7) not the new one(5).</p>

Currently I am generating the json file using a python script and then running it on the local server using python -m SimpleHTTPServer.</p>

<p>What I want to do is to create a link between my python script and the HTML such that when I type in the webaddress, the python script should run on the server side and generate the json file. During this I need to block the UI. When the file is generated, the graph should display itself on the screen. I can generate the graph and json files separately. Need to put them together with a blockui or progress bar(i think progress bar would be too much).</p>

<p>I am a noob to javascript and web development, kinda learning on the fly while creating my graph. Any guidance in this direction would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Prateek</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The snippet of the code as of now is as follows: </p>

<pre><code>d3.json(""json_data.json"", function(error, graph) 
{

  var nodeMap = {};
  graph.nodes.forEach(function(x) { nodeMap[x.name] = x; });
  graph.links = graph.links.map(
  function(x) 
  {
    return {
        source: nodeMap[x.source],
        target: nodeMap[x.target],
        value: x.value
        };
  });

  force
       .nodes(graph.nodes)
      .links(graph.links)
      .start();
</code></pre>

<p>This code I will put in under the success section of the ajax request. I want the script to send the ajax request for a min to see for the existence of the json_data.json file on the server and to display the spinning wheel while the file is created if the time runs out there is the control transfer to the error section of the request.</p>

<p>The json file is simply as:</p>

<pre><code>nodes: {}
links: {} //without any children level of depth.

<p>I've already written that program in another language and I'd like to re-write my program in C++. The language I used previously is called BlitzMax and in that language function are already implemented and just called WriteByte, ReadByte, WriteInt, ReadInt etc.. If you guys will be kind enough to write (or at least link me the source) the functions I need, it will be much appreciated. And if you will write them for me, can you also explain how they work?</p>

<p>Thank you very much to everyone who will help me! :) </p>

<p>Edit: Here, as requested, the code that is somewhat does what I need. It does write the int 50 in binary to a file, but that's as far as I could go to. I still can't understand some parts (code was found in google, I edited it a bit). And I still need a way to write bytes and longs.</p>

  Although DataContext/ObjectContext implement IDisposable, you can (in general)
  get away without disposing instances. Disposing forces the context’s connection
  to dispose—but this is usually unnecessary because L2S and EF close connections
  automatically whenever you finish retrieving results from a query
  &lt;&lt;</p>

<p>This feels wrong and FxCop also complains if you are not diposing something that is IDisposable.</p>

    {

        {
            dbContext.Set&lt;TEntity&gt;().Add(entity);
            dbContext.SaveChanges();
        }
    }

For example, suppose a process A which has its queue Q and a process B that is trying to steal work from Q, calling popTop(). Suppose also that B is preempted after line 2 of popTop() and localBot = X at this moment. If A runs and popBottom() until the bottom of Q &lt;= X, when B resumes its run it will get a thread that already have been processed by A.</p>

<p>I'm using a MySQL database and have a basic blog-type system set up about Computer Applications... The tables look like this:</p>

<pre><code>POSTS
post_id
post_created
post_type      -- could be article, review, feature, whatever
post_status    -- 'a' approved or 'd' for draft

APPS
app_id 
app_name
app_platform   -- Windows, linux, unix, etc..

APP_TO_POST    -- links my posts to its relevant application
atp_id
atp_app_id
atp_post_id
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using the following basic query to pull all articles for the application with the name 'Photoshop' where the post type is an 'Article' and the status of the article is 'a' for approved:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT apps.app_name, apps.app_platform, posts.post_created, posts.post_id
FROM apps
JOIN app_to_post ON app_to_post.atp_app_id = apps.app_id
JOIN posts ON app_to_post.atp_post_id = posts.post_id
WHERE apps.app_name = 'Photoshop'
AND 
posts.post_type = 'Article'
AND
posts.post_status = 'a'
</code></pre>

<p>Which gets me these expected results:</p>

<pre><code>app_name    app_platform   post_created      post_id
Photoshop   Windows        Oct. 20th, 2009   1
Photoshop   Windows        Dec. 1, 2009      3
Photoshop   Macintosh      Nov. 10th, 2009   2
</code></pre>

<p>Would anyone be able to lend a hand on how I could alter that query to only pull the most recent article per application platform?  So for example, I'd like my results to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>app_name    app_platform   post_created      post_id
Photoshop   Windows        Dec. 1, 2009      3
Photoshop   Macintosh      Nov. 10th, 2009   2
</code></pre>

<p>And omit one of the <code>'Photoshop Windows'</code> articles because it isn't the most recent one.</p>

<p>If I simply tack on a <code>MAX(post_created)</code> and a <code>GROUP BY app_platform</code> my results don't always group correctly. From how I understand it I need to perform some kind of inner join of a sub query?</p>

I'm using the <a href=""http://mintthemes.com/isotope-for-wordpress/"" rel=""nofollow"">Isotope For Wordpress</a> plugin to pull my posts into an isotope grid. All works perfectly except I've been unable to get any of the <a href=""http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/adding-items.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Adding Methods</a> to work. Here is what I'm trying (with the goal of adding three new posts to the grid):</p>

<pre><code>var $container = $('.mintthemes_isotopes_container');
var $items = $('&lt;div class=""hentry"" /&gt; &lt;div class=""hentry"" /&gt; &lt;div class=""hentry"" /&gt;');

 $('#insert').click(function() {
    $('.mintthemes_isotopes_container').isotope( 'insert', $items );    
 });

$container.imagesLoaded( function(){
$container.isotope({
  animationEngine: 'best available',
    transformsEnabled: true,
    itemSelector: '.hentry', 
     masonry: {
     columnWidth: 1,
     gutterWidth: 5
    },
});
</code></pre>

<p>I think my problem lies in what im defining what the $items to be. The code above adds three new containers, styled correctly, but there's no content. I think i need to call the actual posts instead of the "".hentry"" but I'm not sure how to do that within that .js file that the plugin provided. Here's how the posts are called in my index.php:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php mintthemes_isotopes(); ?&gt;

&lt;?php
          // Blog post query
$linksPosts = new WP_Query();
$paged = (get_query_var('paged')) ? get_query_var('paged') : 1;

query_posts( array( 'post_type' =&gt; 'post', 'paged'=&gt;$paged, 'showposts'=&gt;3) );
if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts() ) : the_post();?&gt;

&lt;div &lt;?php post_class(); ?&gt;&gt;

&lt;div class="".mintthemes_isotopes_container""&gt;
&lt;div class="".isotope-item""&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""&lt;?php the_permalink(); ?&gt;"" title=""&lt;?php the_title();?&gt;""&gt;&lt;?php the_title();&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;!-- /isotope item --&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;!--/.mintthemes_isotopes_container--&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;!-- /.post_class --&gt;

 &lt;?php endwhile; endif; ?&gt;

The goal is to ensure that data is ""private"" to the user and the server has no way to decrypt it.</p>

<p>At first I thought I could use use some <strong>Javascript</strong> library to encrypt/decrypt the data in the browser before sending it to the server, however <a href=""http://matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/"" rel=""nofollow"">articles like this one</a> convinced me that javascript is still fairly ""weak"" when it comes to cryptography and security.</p>

<p>I am considering now to use <strong>Java Applets</strong> (my codebase is in Java, it would be a natural choice) as a ""bridge"" between the JS code and the server side code, however I can see some pitfalls:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>nobody (in my experience) is using Java applets anymore and that might be for a good reason</li>
  <li>Users need to install/upgrade Java (sometimes it can be an unpleasant operation)</li>
  <li>Tablet/smartphone support is non-existent (but this could be ""solved"" by providing a native app)</li>
  <li><a href=""https://www.java.com/en/download/help/browser_activate_plugin.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">It seems that browsers tend to block Java</a> and make it difficult to enable it</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Another possibility could be to adopt <strong>Adobe Air</strong>. Again, I can see some troubles:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Users need to install/update it</li>
  <li>There seems to be some support for mobile, however I wonder if it would work in a mobile browser (my guess? no)</li>
  <li>Is it still actively used/supported out there? I noticed that Adobe has open sourced Flex and donated it to Apache, which might
  imply scarce interest in Flex's future...</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>What could be the best solution? Are there alternatives (maybe <em>Google Dart</em>?)? What are the best practices for client side encryption?</p>

<p>Is javascript truly out of the picture?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: some reasons why I would like to implement client side encryption (asked in the comments):</p>

<ol>
<li>Users will store confidential data and would like to keep it as private as possible.</li>
<li>If the database is compromised, there is a smaller chance of data leakage</li>
<li>I really value privacy and want to provide this as a feature to my users</li>
<li>Better protection against insider attacks</li>
</ol>

<p>I found this handy script for changing the desktop:</p>

<pre><code>tell application ""System Events""
-- SET DESKTOP TO SPECIFIC PICTURE
tell current desktop
    set picture rotation to 0 -- (0=off, 1=interval, 2=login, 3=sleep)
    set picture to file ""Mac OS X:Library:Desktop Pictures:Plants:Agave.jpg""
end tell 
</code></pre>

<p>And that does the trick to change the desktop, but I need to resize my desktop to ""Stretch to Fill Screen"" on my OSX 10.7 machines.</p>

<p>I suspect there are lots of Unix commands I can send via ARD to change com.apple.desktop.plist settings.  You know, stuff like pmset:</p>

<pre><code>pmset -a  hibernatemode 0 disksleep 10 womp 1 networkoversleep 0 sleep 180 powerbutton 0 ttyskeepawake 1 autorestart 0 panicrestart 157680000 displaysleep 18
</code></pre>

<p>That's pretty handy. </p>

<p>I've used ""defaults read com.apple.desktop"" and found that say, the Placement on my laptop is ""Placement = Crop;"".  </p>

<p>(By the way, when you use the defaults command, are you setting them for every user?)</p>

<p>I even downloaded a Property List Converter to convert com.apple.desktop.plist into an XML file that I could read, and I found out stuff like this:</p>

<pre><code>                    &lt;key&gt;Placement&lt;/key&gt;
                &lt;string&gt;FillScreen&lt;/string&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't know how to use this information.</p>

<p>I've tried overwriting the com.apple.desktop.plist file on my machines with settings I liked, but found that this did nothing at all, it didn't change the desktop, not even if I logged out and in of a client machine, or restarted.</p>

<p>I'm trying very hard to avoid GUI scripting the System Preferences because I know it's in bad form, plus I couldn't figure that out, either. Although I did try, by installing Xcode and looking though the Accessibility testing thing to figure out which pane of which window... and failed to script it.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://www.osxentwicklerforum.de/index.php?page=Thread&amp;threadID=3317"" rel=""nofollow"">this website</a> of someone doing something similar to what I'm doing, but it's in German, and Google Translate  isn't perfect.</p>

void addFoo(String bar, IFoo foo) {

<pre><code>addFoo(""yes"", () -&gt; {

<p>EDIT: My current solution, feels like it would be bad practice, but it's the best I can come up with until someone else has a better idea.</p>

<p>Interface (For the Lambda to use)</p>

<pre><code>@FunctionalInterface

<p>Class (For instancing)</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Command implements ICommand
{
    public String command = """";

    public abstract void processCommand(CommandArgument[] args);

<p>Add method</p>

<pre><code>public void addCommand(String commandName, ICommand action) {

    };
    command.command = commandName;

<p>I chose separate Devise models since the models are completely different from each other. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Table_Inheritance"" rel=""nofollow"">single table inheritance</a> method was out of question.</p>

<p>I understand that with any Devise model I can perform authentication on site, register 'Devised' users, etc. That stuff works.</p>

<p>Now I plan to set up a place to make my authorisation things. I dropped CanCan as it is not supported by Rails 4 at the moment according to what I have found using Google.</p>

<p>So the most suitable option I found was simply using a <code>before_filter</code> and a custom authentication method, which in turn checks for <code>current_user</code> type or its existence and returns if it is good to go or not.</p>

<p>Here is the sample pseudo code I tried already and it looks like it works.</p>

<pre><code>before_filter :custom_authentication!

def custom_authentication!
  if current_admin
    redirect_to ""admin_page""
  elsif current_monkey
    redirect_to ""zoo""
  elsif current_human
    redirect_to ""home""
  else
    # some unauthorised access alert
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>As I understand it, I need to put this kind of code into each controller I have in my Rails 4 app. Is that correct?</p>

<p>My main question is this: is there some better way to do this? I was thinking of putting a single method in <code>application_controller.rb</code> that builds the whole authorisation logic for each type of Devise-enabled user model that ever accesses my app controllers. Would that be a better place for this logic? Is this the correct approach? Or do I need to restart and use a different approach?</p>

<p>Is there any way to prevent this from happening? I can't remove the paragraph margins universally through my CSS (e.g. <code>p {margin: 0 !important;}</code>) since I <em>do</em> need the margins for actual paragraphs of text. I've even tried going to the HTML source view in the editor and manually deleting the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags that it generates, but it immediately adds them back in when I save!</p>

<p>It doesn't happen when the property type is either a long or short string, but that's not always an option since the content might contain images, dynamic controls, etc.</p>

<p>This is becoming a real nuisance since it's very hard to achieve the layout I need when basically every element on the page has extra margins applied to it.</p>

I am using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Processing</a> to code and compile. The issue I am having is that the output (println) is skipping every other byte (maybe that's the wrong term). So XBee output for i = 4 though 11 should look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0,19,162,0,64,121,230,206 (this is the XBee address converted from hex). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the println shows this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>19,0,121,206,125,1,0,3 (which starts getting into other segments of the output).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later, I tried a different route by using an array. It still skips every other entry and I've found that it has to do with my check for i == 126. Is there an alternate way of doing a check like this?</p>

<p>Substitute this draw section for the one below. It's simpler to follow. This was a test with same results...</p>

<p>I was reading the documentation but it doesn't states a limit for nested sub-menus.</p>

<p>Finally my solution was to append a <code>android:onClick=""onOptionsItemSelected""</code> to the fourth level item like:</p>

<pre><code>              &lt;menu&gt;
              &lt;item android:id=""@+id/Level4""

              &lt;/menu&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>to force the call to <code>onOptionItemSelected</code>, it works but is there a better solution???</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I just found that this walk-around doesn't works with Android version 4.0.3 or earlier.!!! not even using <code>onMenuItemSelected</code>...!!!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, under Snow Leopard I can't access encrypted data (passwords) in a keychain item with <code>SecItemCopyMatching()</code>, only usernames, addresses etc. are visible. I tried to retrieve keychain items with the OS X-specific <code>SecKeychainFindInternetPassword()</code> function and it's a little bit more descriptive as it gives me <code>errSecAuthFailed (-25293)</code> error.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, when sandboxing is turned off <code>SecItemAdd()</code>/<code>SecItemCopyMatching()</code> works well under Snow Leopard. Also, the <code>SecKeychainAddInternetPassword()</code> / <code>SecKeychainFindInternetPassword()</code> pair works fine with and without sandboxing. However, I'd really like to be able to use the same code in iOS and OS X and according to docs/API it should be possible.</p>

<hr>

<p>iOS provides five types (classes) of keychain items. You must chose one of those five values for the key <code>kSecClass</code> to determine the type:</p>

<pre><code>kSecClassGenericPassword  used to store a generic password
kSecClassInternetPassword used to store an internet password
kSecClassCertificate      used to store a certificate
kSecClassKey              used to store a kryptographic key
kSecClassIdentity         used to store an identity (certificate + private key)
</code></pre>

<p>After long time of reading apples documentation, blogs and forum-entries, I found out that a keychain item of type <code>kSecClassGenericPassword</code> gets its uniqueness from the attributes <code>kSecAttrAccessGroup</code>, <code>kSecAttrAccount</code> and <code>kSecAttrService</code>.</p>

<p>If those three attributes in request 1 are the same as in request 2, then you receive the same generic password keychain item, regardless of any other attributes. If one (or two or all) of this attributes changes its value, then you get different items.</p>

<p>But <code>kSecAttrService</code> is only available for items of Type kSecClassGenericPassword, so it can't be part of the ""unique key"" of an item of any other type, and there seems to be no documentation that points out clearly which attributes uniquely determine a keychain item.</p>

<p>The sample code in the class ""KeychainItemWrapper"" of ""GenericKeychain"" uses the attribute <code>kSecAttrGeneric</code> to make an item unique, but this is a bug. The two entries in this example only are stored as two distinct entries, because their <code>kSecAttrAccessGroup</code> is different (one has the access group set, the other lets it free). If you try to add a 2nd password without an access group, using Apple's keychainItemWrapper, you will fail.</p>

<p><strong>So, please, answer my questions:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Is it true, that the combination of <code>kSecAttrAccessGroup</code>, <code>kSecAttrAccount</code> and <code>kSecAttrService</code> is the ""unique key"" of a keychain item whose kSecClass is <code>kSecClassGenericPassword</code>?  </li>
<li>Which attributes makes a keychain item unique if its kSecClass is not <code>kSecClassGenericPassword</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p>One feature of this application is to define templates like types, etc. for reuse. For instance the type has attributes and you can create instances of an type, which has values for the attributes.</p>

<p>The problem is, that I don't know how to ensure that only values for attributes can assigned which the type defines. In my solution there is a redundancy which cause the problem, but I don't know how to remove it.</p>

<p>My current (and problematic) approach looks like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>@Entity
class Type
{
    @Id
    @Generated
    private Long id;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy=""type"")
    private List&lt;Attribute&gt; attributes;

    //...
}

@Entity
class Attribute
{
    @Id
    @Generated
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne
    private Type type;

    //...
}

@Entity
class Instance
{
    @Id
    @Generated
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne
    private Type type;

    //...
}

@Entity
class AttributeValue
{

    @Id
    @Embedded
    private ResourceAttributValueId id;

    @Column(name=""val"")

}

@Embeddable
public class ResourceAttributValueId implements Serializable
{
    @ManyToOne
    private ResourceStateImpl resource;

    @ManyToOne
    private ResourceAttributeImpl attribute;

    //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>There the definition of the type is redundant: Type can be reached via AttributeValue->Attribute->Type and AttributeValue->Instance->Type</p>

<p>Another idea was to use type + attribute name as id of the attribute and instance + attribute name as id of the attribute value, but that doesn't solves my problem.</p>

I would want to have an html page with multiple plots and tables depicted. I'm thinking to have data input stored in csv files, appropriately formatted. </p>

<p>The requirements are: </p>

<ul>
<li>plot coordinates are showing on mouse hover</li>
<li>ability to show coordinates of points on a plotted line (points in
scatter plot or bar values for bar chart) 'sticking' to the nearest
lines on hover, with appropriate handling of multiple lines (show several y values for same x)</li>
<li>ability to interactively switch plotted data on/off</li>
<li>easily embeddable into html page, doesn't require additional plugins installed</li>
<li>a good variety of plot types</li>
<li>not too slow to load and stable, there could be ~50 plots on one page
(this is for internal use only, so quickness is not that important)</li>
<li>does it all with minimal effort</li>
</ul>

<p>So far I checked out (by no means a final opinion, correct me if I'm wrong): </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>gnuplot+canvas</strong> - looks good, but samples on their page fail to work
well for me, not always getting mouse clicks right</p></li>
<li><p><strong>python+matplotlib+mplh5canvas</strong> - feels a bit raw, as I understand
some of the stuff above I'd need to implement in Python myself</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RGraph</strong> looks awesome at first glance, not sure if it is good since never heard of 
it and don't have any experience in js, hard to customize(?)</p></li>
<li><p>some other random stuff which seemed bad enough</p></li>

<p>I'd like to test that the loading indicator gets presented when a network call is taking longer than that specified period of time.</p>

<p>Is there a way to simulate this delay with $httpBackend?</p>

<p>The code that triggers these actions (inside a directive):</p>

<pre><code>scope.triggerPopover = function () {
            if (angular.element('.my-element-style').length === 0) {
                scope.detailProm = $timeout(function () {
                makeRESTCall(attrs.assetId || '');
              }, 200);  //waits this length before it makes any call to the backend

             //we want the loading icon to come a little bit later, because it will seem to flicker
             //when calls are fast
             scope.loadingProm = $timeout(function () {
                          showLoadingPopover();
                      }, 500);
                  }
             };
</code></pre>

<p>The html/directive use</p>

<pre><code>&lt;article my-directive ng-mouseenter=""triggerPopover();""&gt;&lt;/article&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the spec I have in the beforeEach()...</p>

<pre><code>//mock the backend call
        $httpBackend.whenGET('/my/rest/endpoint')
            .respond(mockData);
</code></pre>

<p>The test with a hover:</p>

<pre><code>describe('hover tests', function () {
        it('hovering over the article should make a loading element appear while waiting for a restangular call', function () {
            runs(function() {

                //due to a timeout in the directive
                jQuery(jQuery('the-class-im-looking-for')[0]).mouseover();
            });

            waits(1000);

            runs(function() {
                console.log('I want to know if the loading popover was launched, but I need to set a delay in the $httpBackend?');

<p>Accessing /users/register, When I enter something like 'asdfgh' in the e-mail field, I get the default CakePHP error message:</p>

Error: An Internal Error Has Occurred.

<p>Instead of an error message above the e-mail field, telling me:</p>

<pre><code>Please provide a valid email address.

<p>My question: Should it really call the action in the controller when the user's input data is invalid? Is there a way to call the action in the controller only if the user's input data is valid?</p>

The whole model is the same brightness, no matter which way it is facing. I tried getting rid of the attenuation but it still has the same results.

<p>As you can see, the part of the sphere that is facing away from the light (located at [0.0,4.0,0.0]) is the same color as the part facing the light. The ambient factor is supposed to be 0.2 of the fragment color.</p>

<p>In my service layer I have something like </p>

<pre><code>GetAllMessages(string userid); 
</code></pre>

<p>I could have various types of users on my system like Clients / Supplier etc...</p>

<p>This service is only available to all types of users, however what is the best way to implement services only available to selected users e.g.</p>

<pre><code>DeleteAllMessages(string userid); //client only
NewSupplierMessages(string userid); //supplier
</code></pre>

<p>Typically these methods will be in one class called <strong>MessagesService</strong></p>

<p>NOTE: just to clarify, the user is loggedon and authenticated, however I am wondering if I should write my methods as such:</p>

<pre><code>DeleteAllMessages(ClientUser user); //client only
NewSupplierMessages(SupplierUser userid); //supplier
</code></pre>

<p>Basically get the details of the user for every action and call methods in a more strongly typed manner...</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>

<p>Note my domain layer is in a seperate class library from my web app, a ""client user"" will be part of a ""client"", similarly a ""supplier user"" will be part of ""supplier"" - so if I wanted to query my service layer and call the correct code (i.e. retrieve the correct details) - I MUST pass in the user id or a strongly typed class of the user, I cannot see how having a contraint on a DTO object that represents who can access the service as incorrect/ brittle?</p>

<p>Other wise I will have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>GetClientDetails();
</code></pre>

<p>The user is handled by asp.net so we know this action can be accessed by the user, however what if there are multiple clients? Surely then we must pass in some some of client id/ if I was to pass in user id I could get the client id from it...</p>

<p>Rather I would say my domain layer is incorrect seeing something like the above signature...</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong>
The only other alternative I could think off is, when the user authenticates, store the use in a class called UserSession inside the asp.net mvc application as a global state, then inject this using DI (ninject) into my domain service layer, therefore when my signatures can be </p>

<pre><code>GetClientDetails();
</code></pre>

<p>The domain service class implementing this interface could be:</p>

<pre><code>public class ClientService : IClientWorkerService
{

    private ISession _session;
    private IGenericRepo = _repo;
    public ClientService(IUserSession _session, IGenericRepo _repo)
    {
      this._session = _session;
      this._repo = _repo;
    }

    public ClientDetails GetClientDetails()
    {
      var loggedonuser = _session.GetUser();

      if(!loggedonuser.isClient())
        throw new NoAccessException()

      return _repo.Single&lt;Client&gt;(x=&gt; x.ClientID == loggedonuser.ClientID);
    }

}

<p>Specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Image URLs in the CSS are rewritten. For example, a file
  ~/styles/main.css, with the content:</p>

<pre><code>body { background-image: url(img/bg.jpg); }
</code></pre>
  
  <p>is transformed into:</p>

<pre><code>body { background-image: url(/_assets/images/styles/img/bg_25cb72e61bd5ag2_jpg);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Now in my particular case for example, in my .less file, I might have a rule like this:</p>

<pre><code>.ribbon {
    background: url(""/Public/image/blue-rib.png"") no-repeat;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And Cassette is supposed to rewrite it and the browser actually receives this rule:</p>

<pre><code>.ribbon {    
    background: url(""/_cassette/file/Public/images/blue-rib_81ab1e7f2fdb27c91a9e9b41eed420390e21f7e0.png"") no-repeat;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the image displays fine.</p>

<p>In this particular case, using the same idea, the background rule <strong>is not</strong> rewritten by cassette and the users receives the regular rule I manually entered in the .less file.</p>

<p>Here are the facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The working and non-working rules are both in the same .less file.</li>
<li>The image is correctly in my Visual Studio project, in a folder <code>/Public/images</code>.</li>
<li>Using the Google Chrome web tool, I can see the rule is <code>background: url(""/Public/image/blue-rib.png"") no-repeat;</code> - Not rewritten as it should be by Cassette.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any ideas on what might the cause of this?</p>

<p>I tried changing to debug=false in web.config, running the app and nothing works. </p>

<p>Tried switching back to debug=true and still no dice.</p>

<p>Sadly, I've found no example matching my use case, may be I overlooked/googled the one I'm searching.</p>

<p>As example: a currency update, where you have multipble subscriber in the gui-layer, but also multiple provider in the data-access and business logic (which are all on client side).</p>

<p>so currently i've implemented a backendservice which gets me a currency and returns me an observable:</p>

<pre><code>...
update: function (from, to) {
    var urlForCurrencies = createConverterUrl(from, to);
    var observable = Rx.Observable.fromPromise(
        $http({method: 'JSONP', url: urlForCurrencies})
    );

    return observable;
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>and in the front end part:</p>

<pre><code>...
var that = this;
DataService.update(currencyFrom,currencyTo).subscribe(
    function (data) {
        that.currency = data.data.CHF_EUR.val;
    },
    function (err) {
        that.error = err.message;
    }    
);
....
</code></pre>

<p>As we see, this would only work once, when requested from teh gui layer.
How can I send another updated of the currency course or trigger an update from a different view and still use the same stream/observable?</p>

<p>We wrote a logging framework a while back that uses <strong>NEST</strong> to index logs to <strong>ElasticSearch</strong>. Currently I am upgrading the framework to do <strong>bulk inserts</strong> using the <code>BulkAsync(...)</code> call that NEST provides. We thought it would be handy to use <strong>TPL data flow</strong> to build up a batch request (using <code>BatchBlock</code> and <code>ActionBlock</code>) and then when the batch target is hit, ship it to the bulk indexing method. Problem is that when executing <code>BulkAsync</code>, or any other indexing method for that matter, inside the <code>ActionBlock</code> an exception is thrown (With message <code>""Thread was being aborted.""</code>). This message and the stack trace was the only info I could get on the exception because visual studio couldn't show me the exception in xUnit's debug mode, basically I get (<code>""Unable to evaluate expression because the code is optimized or a native frame is on top of the call stack""</code>) <strong>but that's unrelated</strong>.</p>

</code></pre>

<h2>What I've tried</h2>

<p>I have tested the bulk indexing code outside of the <code>ActionBlock</code> and it works, it's just failing inside of the block. <strong>Any ideas as to why this would happen?</strong></p>

<h2>Working Code</h2>

<p><em>Without using an ActionBlock to call it</em></p>

<pre><code>private async Task IndexLogEntriesAsync(IEnumerable&lt;LogEntry&gt; logEntries)
{
    try
    {
        var request = new BulkDescriptor();
        foreach (LogEntry logEntry in logEntries)
            request.Index&lt;LogEntry&gt;(op =&gt; op
                    .Index(_index)
                    .Type(""logentry"")
                    .Id(Guid.NewGuid().ToString())
                    .Document(logEntry));

        var result = await _elasticClient.BulkAsync(request);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        string m = e.Message; // Thread was being aborted.
        // No can do this logging thing.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>What's breaking it</h2>

<pre><code>BatchBlock&lt;LogEntry&gt; batchBlock = new BatchBlock&lt;LogEntry&gt;(_batchSize); //batch size = 10
ActionBlock&lt;IEnumerable&lt;LogEntry&gt;&gt; asyncIndexer = new ActionBlock&lt;IEnumerable&lt;LogEntry&gt;&gt;(
    async (le) =&gt;
    {
        await this.IndexLogEntriesAsync(le);
    });

batchBlock.LinkTo(asyncIndexer, new DataflowLinkOptions { PropagateCompletion = true });

//And in the IndexLogEntry method call
batchBlock.Post(logEntry); //which builds up the batch and ships when the batch is full
</code></pre>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I got rid of the TPL Data flow blocks and wrote my own solution, to test a different scenario. Used a <code>ConcurrentQueue</code> that constantly queues items and dequeues (from within a thread) either on a timeout or when the batch size was hit. I got exactly the same error. </p>

<h3>context</h3>

<p>I'm wrapping up an ML training operation in a function call, and I want to get the levels of a column of a <code>data.table</code> that has been passed in. I noticed that this requires that the column argument be dequoted using <code>get()</code>:</p>

<p>A minimal example to demonstrate failing approaches:</p>

<pre><code>library(data.table)
test.table &lt;- data.table(col1 = rep(c(0,1), times = 10), col2 = 1:20)
col.id &lt;- ""col1""

str(test.table[,levels(col.id),with=FALSE])

Classes ‘data.table’ and 'data.frame':  0 obs. of  0 variables
 - attr(*, "".internal.selfref"")=&lt;externalptr&gt;

&gt; str(test.table[,levels(factor(col.id)), with=FALSE])
Classes ‘data.table’ and 'data.frame':  20 obs. of  1 variable:
 $ col1: num  0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 ...
 - attr(*, "".internal.selfref"")=&lt;externalptr&gt;

&gt; str(test.table[,levels(as.factor(col.id)), with=FALSE])
Classes ‘data.table’ and 'data.frame':  20 obs. of  1 variable:
 $ col1: num  0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 ...
 - attr(*, "".internal.selfref"")=&lt;externalptr&gt;

levels(test.table[,factor(col.id), with=FALSE])
NULL

levels(test.table[,as.factor(col.id), with=FALSE])
NULL
</code></pre>

<p>And yet, <code>test.table[,col.id, with = FALSE]</code> is a valid way to access the column.</p>

<p>Here's some things that work:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; test.table[,levels(as.factor(get(col.id)))]
[1] ""0"" ""1""
&gt; test.table[,levels(as.factor(get(col.id)))]
[1] ""0"" ""1""
&gt; test.table[,levels(factor(get(col.id)))]
[1] ""0"" ""1""
&gt; levels(test.table[,factor(get(col.id))])
[1] ""0"" ""1""
</code></pre>
