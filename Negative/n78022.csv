The program works pretty well in general, but unfortunately some of the text that I want to convert to Times New Roman font contains large amounts of scientific notation.</p>

<p>Sometimes, these special characters appear as boxes, which would be undesirable. I would also like to avoid a script that is too time-consuming to execute (ie one that cycles through individual characters, identifies the ones with font = ""Symbol"", and skips formatting of those specific characters), since ideally this script will be used to save time through automation. </p>

<p>The Unicode notation for the text that I am trying to change is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>25.0 L U+F0BB U+F020 U+F032 U+F035 U+F02E U+F035 U+F030 kg</p>

<p>hello all,
with my add a box butten (#purchase), I add boxes/items to the shopping carts. (this costs 25 of the credits)</p>

<p>When you click the orange div inside, the credits also decrease with an amount of 15 credits, an fades out the top div (so you can see wich element has already cost 15 credits. Fading out happens only once, which is good, but while it's fading out, the user can still click the div, wich causes the credits to decrease more than should.</p>

<p>By some time playing around I found out that there is in fact a possibility to add functions in this way: If the functions are member functions of an reference class, this works! I.e., the following code (together with the ""+"" definition from above)</p>

<pre><code>clsA = setRefClass(""clsA"", 
  methods = list(
    b = function(x) 2*x
  ))

inst_a = clsA$new()

<p>What is the reason for this strange behavior? Why doesn´t <code>+.function</code> care about ""usual"" function but class member functions? Has anyone an idea how ""expand"" the operator to usual functions?</p>

<p>My project structure is like this:</p>

<p>When I start my cdo-server.product as Eclipse application everything works fine. </p>

<p>When I build it and materialize it with Maven, it also has a BUILD SUCCESS. But when I start the CDO-CommonRepositoryServer.app which was built with Maven, there is the error: </p>

/Users/pathtoCDO-Server/CDO-CommonRepositoryServer.app/Contents/MacOS/${resource_loc:/cdo.server/config}/cdo-server.xml.

<p>This is logical, because this is the wrong path. When I enter the absolute path to the cdo-server.xml in the vmargs (<code>-Dnet4j.config=/Users/pathtoCDO-config/cdo-server.xml</code>) it also works. However, I want to make it relative, so that everybody in our git-repo can use it and not only in my folder structure.</p>

<p>Is there any possibility to make this path relative? </p>

<p>With <code>-Dnet4j.config=""${resource_loc:/cdo.server/config}""</code> it only works when i run it as an eclipse application, but not as maven built .app file.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Now I can start the CDO-CommonRepository.app file if I take </p>

<pre><code>-Dnet4j.config=../../../../../../../../../../cdo.server/config

<p>If I try use a regular, synchronous servlet I don't get the messages in the log upon shutdown.</p>

<p>I have a context listener on the servlet which is the following:</p>

<pre><code>class ContextListener extends ServletContextListener {
    private var system: ActorSystem = _

    override def contextInitialized(sce: ServletContextEvent): Unit = {
        val context = sce.getServletContext

        system = ActorSystem.create(""StridentStandard"")

        context.setAttribute(""actor.system"", system)
    }

    override def contextDestroyed(sce: ServletContextEvent): Unit = {
        println(""Shutting down..."")
        system.shutdown()
        system.awaitTermination()
        println(""Shut down successfully."")
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, from what it looks like - the ActorSystem <em>should</em> be shutting down correctly - but it seems some threads are hanging on.</p>

<p>I'm fairly new to Scala, and Akka... and concurrency, and as a result am not really sure where to go from here.</p>

We have a need for distributed caching feature and it seems AppFabric is a good solution.
However, I have a few questions which I hope will be answered here.</p>

<p>We are considering to host AppFabric Cache server on the same machine where our web application is installed. I have found on MSDN article stating that AppFabric should be installed on a dedicated machine. It is also noted there that AppFabric can be installed on the same machine as application itself but some issues should be considered (quote from article):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Windows Server AppFabric cache hosts should be dedicated to the caching service, which means that those servers are not also used as application, web, or database servers. It is possible to use non-dedicated cache servers in a cluster, but this scenario is not supported. Despite this policy, if you decide to use non-dedicated cache hosts, make sure to properly estimate and test the configuration for each cache host to allow enough memory and network resources for both the caching service and all other services on the machines. Also understand that spikes in processor and network utilization by other services will negatively impact the performance and stability of the cache cluster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a link to this article: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee790954.aspx"">Article #1</a></p>

<p>Now, this sounds reasonable enough, I was thinking that limiting amount of RAM AppFabric cache can use would be enough. But, reading another article on MSDN I have found this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For both physical and virtual machines, you should note the location of the cache cluster to the application or web servers that use the cache. If they are in separate data centers, make sure that the latency between those datacenters will not negatively affect your performance. At this stage it might be tempting to use your application or web servers for your cache servers. Although possible, this is not supported. First, any resource usage spikes by services such as IIS on those machines could impact the cache cluster. <strong>Second, the caching service assumes that it is on a dedicated server and can potentially use more much more memory than you specify.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a link to this article: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg186017.aspx"">Article #2</a></p>

<p>If I understand correctly statement above, this means that despite my config settings for AppFabric, it will take as much RAM as it wants? Can this be really true? Has anyone some experience with configuration where application and AppFabric are located on the same machine?</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there is a way to query some kind of a database and only fetch a certain window in the full result set without having to actually go through them all.</p>

<p>For example, if I query my database and I want only results number 100 to 200, would the database fetch all the results (say 0 to 1000) that match my query and later on filter them to exclude any thing outside my specified window frame ?</p>

<p>Actually, I'm working on a full text search problem (not really relational db stuff).</p>

<p>So how about Google and other search engines, do they get full result then filter or do they have direct access to only the needed window frame ?</p>

<p>EDIT:
I found the explanation of my problem in the documentation, but this does not help me to find a solution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The contains and intersects methods
  consider the interior of a Shape to be
  the area it encloses as if it were
  filled. This means that these methods

You have some sort of abstract <code>Widget</code> class, with an abstract subclass for widgets that can contain other widgets, and then you have a profusion of further abstract classes for widgets that support textual display, widgets that support being the input focus, widgets that have a boolean state, right down to actual concrete classes such as buttons, sliders, scrollbars, check boxes, etc.</p>

<p>My question is: What is the best way to do this in Haskell?</p>

<p>There are a number of things that make building a Haskell GUI difficult, but are <em>not</em> part of my question. Doing interactive I/O is mildly tricky in Haskell. Implementing a GUI almost always means writing a wrapper to an extremely low-level C or C++ library. And people writing such wrappers tend to copy the existing API verbatim (presumably so anybody who knows the wrapped library will feel at home). These problems do not interest me at the moment. I'm interested purely in how best to model subtype polymorphism in Haskell.</p>

<p>What kind of properties would we want from our hypothetical GUI library? Well, we want it to be possible to add new widget types at any time. (In other words, a closed set of possible widgets is no good.) We want to minimise code duplication. (There are <em>a lot</em> of widget types!) Ideally we want to be able to stipulate one specific widget type when necessary, but also to be able to handle collections of <em>any</em> widget type if needed.</p>

<p>All of the above is of course trivial in any self-respecting OO language. But what is the best way to do this in Haskell? I can think of several approaches, but I'm not sure which one would be ""best"".</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> Using ProGuard can make it go wrong on some devices. I have it confirmed on HTC One S Android 4.1.1 build 3.16.401.8, but judging by e-mails I got, a lot of phones with Android 4+ are affected. For some of them (Galaxy S3), american operator-branded phones are affected, while international versions are not. Many phones are not affected. </p>

<p>Below is the code of activity which calculates C(n,k) for 1&lt;=n&lt;25 and 0&lt;=k&lt;=n. On device mentioned above the first session gives correct results, but the subsequent launches show incorrect results, each time in different positions.</p>

<p>I have 3 questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How can it be? Even if ProGuard made something wrong, calculations should be consistent between devices and sessions.</p></li>
<li><p>How can we avoid it? I know substituting <code>double</code> by <code>long</code> is fine in this case, but it is not a universal method. Dropping using <code>double</code> or releasing not-obfuscated versions is out of question.</p></li>
<li><p>What Android versions are affected? I was quite quick with fixing it in the game, so I just know that many players have seen it, and at least the most had Android 4.0</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Overflow is out of question, because sometimes I see mistake in calculating <code>C(3,3)=3/1*2/2*1/3</code>. Usually incorrect numbers start somewhere in C(10,...), and look like a phone has ""forgotten"" to make some divisions.</p>

<p>The only thing I did find that worked was copy &amp; pasting the code
from the main Visual studio instance, into another which had a simple console app.
This then worked as expected (queried database and got results into a dataTable, created a datatablereader on that table, then queried hasrows before calling .Read()...
All of which worked.</p>

<p>I am struggling to see what could cause this, as there are NO code faults - i'm 100% certain, as it runs perfectly when published to the webserver.</p>

<p>In my system, a user can add files, they can also retrieve, delete, and update them, however, the caveat to that is a user can only retrieve and modify their own files (where <code>File.UserID</code> should match the identity of the logged in user).</p>

<p>My Files controller looks as follows.</p>

<pre><code>[Authorize]

    private readonly FileRepository _fileRepository = new FileRepository();

        // ... add the file
        file.UserID = CurrentPrincipal.UserID; // more pseudo code...

        _fileRepository.Add(file);

<p>I will have a bunch of users of the system who will all have a username and password.
I only want to store a randomly salted hash of user's passwords in my database so as to avoid all passwords being discovered in the case of the database being compromised, and a salt (per password) to avoid pre-computed rainbow tables / dictionary attacks.</p>

<p>I've been looking at digest authentication as it has the benefit of preventing replay attacks by the use of random 'nonce' provided by the server to the client, like so:</p>

<pre><code>A1 = string.hashMD5 (username + "":"" + realm + "":"" + password)
A2 = string.hashMD5 (paramTable.method + "":"" + paramTable.uri)
requestdigest = string.hashMD5 (A1 + "":"" + nonce + "":"" + A2)
</code></pre>

<p>However, in order for the server to re-compute 'requestdigest', it must know 'password', but my server will only have access to a salted hash.</p>

<p>If I was not using a salt, I could add a further step on the client side like so (because on the client side the password is known) -</p>

<pre><code>HashedPword = string.hashMD5(password)
A1 = string.hashMD5 (username + "":"" + realm + "":"" + HashedPword)
A2 = string.hashMD5 (paramTable.method + "":"" + paramTable.uri)
requestdigest = string.hashMD5 (A1 + "":"" + nonce + "":"" + A2)
</code></pre>

<p>And then on the server side I could retrieve the Hashed password from the db to perform the re-computation.</p>

<p>Alas, the client would need to know the salt as well in order to do it properly which would be e.g. </p>

<pre><code>HashedSaltedPword = string.hashMD5(password+salt)
A1 = string.hashMD5 (username + "":"" + realm + "":"" + HashedSaltedPword)
A2 = string.hashMD5 (paramTable.method + "":"" + paramTable.uri)
requestdigest = string.hashMD5 (A1 + "":"" + nonce + "":"" + A2)
</code></pre>

<p>So that leaves transmitting the salt to the client without authentication by maybe exposing a web service function that returns the salt, given a username.
But then anyone could get access to the salts.</p>

<p>What i'm wondering though is if giving out the salts is a problem or not.
Because, the salt on it's own is useless without the hash stored in the database, and if the database is compromised, then the attacker would have access to both the hashes and salt anyway.
And following on from that, if I give away the salt for free, then I may as well just use the username itself AS the salt, as that would be unique per user - and thus I wouldn't even need to expose a webservice call to discover the salt in the first place.</p>

<p>What do you guys think? Does exposing salts or having a known salting mechanism matter?
Any other thoughts?</p>

<p>I'm not really worried about the downside to digest authentication - i.e. that the client does not know if it is talking to the 'real' server or not. Because, it's not like the client's password is going to be exposed using this method, and i'm not asking the client for anything confidential over this link like a credit card. I.e. stuff i want to secure resides on my server, and the server won't be asking the client for any of THEIR secure information.</p>

<p>Edit:
hmm, actually i just read this link <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2583203/salt-passwords-and-security"">Salt, passwords and security</a> which does basically confirmed to me that knowing the salt does not matter.
So i'm thinking of implementing some sortof hash like:</p>

<pre><code>HashedSaltedPword = string.hashMD5(password+username+siteWideSaltExistingOnlyInCode)
</code></pre>

<p>The addition of the site-wide salt is in case someone has created rainbow tables for common username's.
Does this approach seem secure?</p>

She had a small Windows 7 partition that she was dual booting to with boot camp.  As it turns out, she mainly uses the Windows partition, and the partition was way too small.  She asked me to make it bigger.</p>

<p>So, I used GParted and made the partition the right sizes; however, now the Mac boot manager does not recognize the Windows partition now.  I expected this to happen, but I did not expect boot camp to be so useless afterwards.  The ""Untitled"" Windows partition in OSX looks ok.  The boot camp UI only lets gives me the option to restore to a single partition.</p>

<p>My question is: can I just manually change the boot entries without the UI ala grub?  Or, how else can I fix the boot loader?</p>

We basically send an enormous number of small packages.  We are more concerned with latency than throughput.  The machines are all modern, multi-core (at least four, generally eight, 16 if you count hyperthreading) machines, always with a load of 2.0 or less, usually with a load less than 1.0.  The networking hardware is also under 50% capacity.</p>

<p>The delays we see look like queueing delays: the packets will quickly start increasing in latency, until it looks like they jam up, then return back to normal.</p>

<p>The messaging structure is basically this: in the ""sending thread"", pull messages from a queue, add a timestamp (using <code>gettimeofday()</code>), then call <code>send()</code>.  The receiving program receives the message, timestamps the receive time, and pushes it in a queue.  In a separate thread, the queue is processed, analyzing the difference between sending and receiving timestamps.  (Note that our internal queues are not part of the problem, since the timestamps are added outside of our internal queuing.)</p>

<p>We don't really know where to start looking for an answer to this problem.  We're not familiar with Linux internals.  Our suspicion is that the kernel is queuing or buffering the packets, either on the send side or the receive side (or both).  But we don't know how to track this down and trace it.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, we're using CentOS 4.x (RHEL kernel 2.6.9).</p>

The tint is easy and works fine, but when I try to set the font using setTitleTextAttributes, it changes the font but on some views the title shows up being cut off at the end (ie. ""My titl...""). If I change views and then come back to the view with the cut off title, the title does show up properly though. </p>

<p>Currently my viewDidLoad in my custom UINavigationController has:</p>

<pre><code>UIFont *font = [UIFont fontWithName:@""GillSans-Bold"" size:22];
NSDictionary *attr = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:font, UITextAttributeFont, nil];
[self.navigationBar setTitleTextAttributes:attr];
</code></pre>

<p>My thought was that it's changing the font of the titleView but it's not being resized in accordance to the new size (since it's a bigger font). Another issue is when the phone is turned to landscape, any letters that hang low (g, p, y) have the bottoms cut off. Is there a way to resize the label or allow for minimumFontSize to be set so the text simply shrinks when it's too big?</p>

<p>ALSA supports mute/unmute with the alsamixer or amixer controls for that device. Other audio cards have volume control.</p>

<p>I want to control the volume of the HDMI out. I tried to use the ""softvol"" pcm type, but it failed to load on my actual hardware (worked on the ""default"" slave, when I specified a loopback slave, but not when I specified the hw:NVidia slave).</p>

<p>The plan is to route from JACK to the HDMI, and I want to control the volume to that HDMI. Any suggestions? Below is the addition I made to the .asoundrc (which failed):</p>

<pre><code>pcm.test {
  type softvol
  slave.pcm ""hw:5""
  control {
    name ""volname""
    card 5
  }

Also, I'm getting 'Aborted (core dumped)', probably because I have very little idea what I'm doing with <code>malloc</code> (If anything at all, in this case).</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct cards {
    char suits[4][9], faces[13][6];
    int suit, face, card;
} cards;

const int SHOE_SIZE = DECK_SIZE * numberOfDecks; // user given input, please disregard

cards shoe[SHOE_SIZE];
init_struct(&amp;shoe);

cards *shoe_p = malloc(sizeof(cards) + 1000 * sizeof(int));
shoe_p = shoe;

int i;
for (i = 0; i &lt; SHOE_SIZE; i++) {
    shoe[i].card = i;
    shoe[i].suit = shoe[i].card % 4;  // maybe one of these should be % and another /
    shoe[i].face = shoe[i].card % 13; // but when I try that, I get strings like ""ace of ace""
    printf(""card #%d = %s of %s\n"", i+1, shoe-&gt;faces[shoe[i].face], shoe-&gt;suits[shoe[i].suit]);
}

free(shoe);
</code></pre>

<p>The parts of code that I left out are doubtfully sources of the problems described. Please let me know if I should provide more information!</p>

<p>Edit: Additional question; Am I accessing my the struct members 'faces' and 'suits' in a proper manner? To me it would seem so, but then again, I can't see what else should cause the weird output of my string (see comment in code).</p>

<p>Also, can I have SHOE_SIZE as a member of my array, and access it in the same manner(shoe->variable), without having to assign it through the variable SHOE_SIZE first?</p>

<p>All examples for I/O-intensive async methods I've seen so far call only other async methods from the .NET library, but no light is shed on the way the context switching is done internally. The documentation says that in these cases no separate thread is used and the multithreading overhead is apparently worth only for CPU-intensive operations. So I guess using Task.Run() is not an option, or am I wrong?</p>

<p>I'm using Microsoft Excel 2013</p>

<p>The sample data is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>1   01/19/2015  40  0.250006538
                52  0.052997791
                58  0.010990106
2   01/20/2015  40  0.250001126
                52  0.052997369
                58  0.010990412
3   01/21/2015  40  0.250005088
                52  0.052996605
                58  0.010990819
</code></pre>

<p>And it goes on and on. What I intend to do is to extract the values of the data beside a certain number (e.g for 40, it'll be 0.250006538, 0.250001126, 0.250005088 etc.) and plot them on a graph.</p>

<p>What i've done so far is to Union the range together as such:</p>

<pre><code>'checks for number 40
For each c In rng1.Cells
        Set cellRange = Range(""D"" &amp; c.Row)
        Set cCell1 = Union(cCell1, cellRange)
Next
</code></pre>

<p>And i've also tried this method:</p>

<pre><code> 'checks for number 40
 For each c In rng1.Cells
    If Not s = vbNullString Then
           s = s &amp; "","" &amp; Range(""D"" &amp; c.Row).address
    Else
           s = Range(""D"" &amp; c.Row).address
    End If
 Next
</code></pre>

<p>The end result i'll get is either a cCell1 variable or s variable with a list of addresses.</p>

<pre><code> $D$2,$D$5,$D$8,$D$11,$D$14,$D$17,$D$20,$D$23,$D$26,$D$29,$D$32,$D$35,$D$38,$D$41,$D$44,$D$47,$D$50,$D$53,$D$56,$D$59,$D$62,$D$65,$D$68,$D$71,$D$74,$D$77,$D$80,$D$83,$D$86,$D$89,$D$92,$D$95,$D$98,$D$101,$D$104,$D$107,$D$110,$D$113,$D$116,$D$119,$D$122,$D$125,$D$128,$D$131,$D$134,$D$137,$D$140,$D$143,$D$146,$D$149,$D$152,$D$155,$D$158,$D$161,$D$164,$D$167,$D$170,$D$173,$D$176,$D$179,$D$182,$D$185,$D$188,$D$191,$D$194,$D$197,$D$200,$D$203,$D$206,$D$209,$D$212,$D$215,$D$218,$D$221,$D$224,$D$227,$D$230,$D$233,$D$236,$D$239,$D$242
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is when I try to plot the graph on a chart with</p>

<pre><code> ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(1).Values = Range(cCell1.address)
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code> ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(1).Values = Range(s)
</code></pre>

<p>It stops and gives me a runtime-error '1004'.</p>

<p>I assume this is happening because the addresses in the variables are too long to be processed by the Range function... The datasheet i'm working with has hundreds to thousands of data, and the graph has to be plotted according to the number of points.</p>

<p>Is there any workarounds to this? Thank you so much!</p>

<ul>
<li><code>PERSON</code> with columns <code>person_id</code> and <code>total</code></li>
<li><code>DATA</code> with columns <code>data_a</code>, <code>data_b</code>, <code>data_c</code>, and <code>data_person_id</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Each ""person"" can have zero or more entries in <code>DATA</code> - your standard one-to-many relationship. <code>PERSON</code> has a <code>total</code> column that is the sum of values in <code>DATA</code>. There are currently some discrepancies between <code>total</code> and the actual entries in <code>DATA</code> where <code>DATA</code> is correct but <code>total</code> is wrong.</p>

<p>This is the query I'm using to find the discrepancies:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  person_id
FROM PERSON JOIN (
  SELECT
    data_person_id,
    SUM( data_a + data_b + data_c ) as data_total
  FROM
    DATA
  GROUP BY
    data_person_id
  ) x ON data_person_id = person_id
WHERE
  person_total != data_total
</code></pre>

<p>I plan on doing this through Hibernate as a query where the backend will be Postgres 9.x.</p>

<p>The incorrect query that I'm trying to understand/fix is:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE
  ONLY PERSON
SET
  total = data_info.calc_total
FROM (
  SELECT
    SUM( data_a + data_b + data_c ) as calc_total
  FROM
    DATA
  WHERE
    DATA.data_person_id = person_id
  GROUP BY
    DATA.data_person_id
) as data_info
WHERE
  PERSON.person_id IN (
    SELECT
      data_person_id
    FROM PERSON JOIN (
      SELECT
        data_person_id,
        SUM( data_a + data_b + data_c ) as data_total
      FROM
        DATA
      GROUP BY
        data_person_id
      ) x ON person_id = data_person_id
    WHERE
      total != data_total
  )
</code></pre>

<p>Right now, it won't run because of <code>WHERE DATA.data_person_id = person_id</code>. But if I take that out, the wrong values get used.</p>

<p>The following seems to work but I'm confused as to why:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE
  ONLY PERSON
SET
  total = data_info.calc_total
FROM 
  PERSON P JOIN (
    SELECT
      data_person_id,
      SUM( data_a + data_b + data_c ) as calc_total
    FROM
      DATA
    WHERE
      DATA.data_person_id = person_id
    GROUP BY
      DATA.data_person_id
  ) as data_info ON P.person_id = data_person_id
WHERE
  PERSON.person_id IN (
    SELECT
      data_person_id
    FROM PERSON JOIN (
      SELECT
        data_person_id,
        SUM( data_a + data_b + data_c ) as data_total
      FROM
        DATA
      GROUP BY
        data_person_id
      ) x ON person_id = data_person_id
    WHERE
      total != data_total
  )
</code></pre>

<p>I believe my problem lies in my misunderstanding of the <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/sql-update.html"" rel=""nofollow"">doc</a> (I'm guessing the part about the self-join).</p>

<p>Also, any ways to improve this query is appreciated!</p>

<pre><code>abstract class Abs1 { //... }
abstract class Abs2 { //... }
interface I { //... }

public static final class C1 extends Abs implements I {

  public final static Inner newInstance() { return Inner.create(); }

  public final class Inner extends Abs2 {

  }

  public final static C1 build() {

}

final static class C2 extends Abs implements I {

  // exactly same as in C1: 

  public final static Inner newInstance() { return Inner.create(); }

  public final class Inner extends Abs2 { 
    private static Inner create() { return new Inner(); }
  }

  public final static C1 build() { 
    // builds the object instantiating some fields with defaults
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I have many other classes like C1 and C2 in the same style.
As you can see, every outer class (C1, C2 ...) has an Inner class, always named as Inner. Also, all InnerClasses extend the same abstract class.</p>

<p>I want to create instances of each of these outer-classes from Strings. I have a utility (Merger) that can merge an instance with it's String.</p>

<pre><code>def createC1(str: String) = {
  val ins = C1.newInstance
  Merger(ins, str)
  ins.build
}

def createC2(str: String) = {
  val ins = C2.newInstance
  Merger(ins, str)
  ins.build
}
</code></pre>

<p>... this seemed like obvious code-duplication. So I wanted to take advantage of type-parameterization.</p>

<pre><code>def build[A &lt;: Abs](str: String) = {
  val ins = A.newInstance // this obviously won't compile - but this is my intent
  Merger(ins, str)
  ins.build
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I could do: <code>build[Cn](str)</code></p>

<p>How can I call the static Java method using the type parameter info ? I tried using ClassTag:</p>

<pre><code>def build[A &lt;: Abs : ClassTag](str: String) = {
    val ins1 = (new A) // ins1 type is now A with Object, WAT ?
    val ins2 = ins.asInstanceOf[A] // I do not want to do asInstanceOf but the compiler won't recognize that ins2 is an instance of A otherwise
    // ins2 has access to newInstance method
    // Not sure if the below code works, I had to actually try it :)
    // Merger(str, ins2)
    // ins2.build()
    ???
}
</code></pre>

<p>Why doesn't it infer the type in <code>ins1</code> ?</p>

<p>Now I want to process my XML and check for each destination record in MySQL table. I have to compare only <code>DestinationId</code> against each record and check whether it exists in my DB table or not. If it does exist leave that record and move on, and if it doesn't exist then execute an <code>INSERT</code> query to insert that record in that table.</p>

<p>I first tried to accomplish this using PHP foreach loop mechanism, but since data is so huge, it caused me serious performance and speed issues. Then I came up with a MySQL Procedure approach like this:</p>

<pre><code>DELIMITER $$

USE `destinations`$$

DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS `p_import_destinations`$$

CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` PROCEDURE `p_import_destinations`(
    p_xml                     TEXT
)
BEGIN
    DECLARE v_row_index INT UNSIGNED DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE v_row_count INT UNSIGNED;
    DECLARE v_xpath_row VARCHAR(255);

    -- calculate the number of row elements.
    SET v_row_count := extractValue(p_xml,'count(/Destinations/Destination)');

    -- loop through all the row elements
    WHILE v_row_index &lt; v_row_count DO        
        SET v_row_index := v_row_index + 1;
        SET v_xpath_row := CONCAT('/Destinations/Destination[',v_row_index,']');

    INSERT IGNORE INTO destinations VALUES (
        NULL,
        extractValue(p_xml,CONCAT(v_xpath_row, '/child::DestinationId')),
        extractValue(p_xml,CONCAT(v_xpath_row, '/child::Country')),
        extractValue(p_xml,CONCAT(v_xpath_row, '/child::City')),
        extractValue(p_xml,CONCAT(v_xpath_row, '/child::State'))
    );


    END WHILE;

END$$  

DELIMITER ;
</code></pre>

<p>Query to call this procedure:</p>

<pre><code>SET @xml := LOAD_FILE('C:/Users/Muhammad Ali/Desktop/dest.xml'); 
CALL p_import_destinations(@xml);
</code></pre>

<p>This worked perfect but I am still not sure about this approach's scalability, performance and speed. And <code>IGNORE</code> clause used in this procedure skips through duplicate record but accumulates the auto increment key value. Like if it is checking row with <code>id</code> <code>3306</code>, if this record is a duplicate, it will not insert this in the table (which is a good thing) but will take the auto increment key <code>3307</code>, and when next time it inserts the NON-DUPLICATING record it will insert it at <code>3308</code>. This don't seems good.</p>

<p>Any other approach(s) to meet such requirement would be much appreciated. And please guide me if I am ok to go on with this solution? If not, why?</p>

<p>Just remember, I am dealing with a very huge amount of data.</p>

<p>a) I am going to have an html table, with each row having adjustable heights depending on the amount of text in each row. A row cannot be ""cut-off"" at the end of a page and the start of the next page.</p>

<p>b) There is no defined number of rows per page, this needs to be flux depending on how many can fit.</p>

<p>c) every page must have the same header of a defined height.</p>

<p>d) The page must be printable on 11x17 paper with half inch margins.</p>

<p>Basically I am not sure how to approach this. I have built a normal  in html - but when printing the rows get cut off. I also am not sure how to figure out the ""header"" on every page requirement. </p>

<p>Any ideas on the best way I can approach this challenge?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I'm trying to parse RSS feed to JSON, but due to XSS problems it can't be done with JS (I'm not using jQuery so don't recommend me plugins). I thought I'll do this with PHP help and wrote some code to get url, parse it, some loops etc. and it returns proper JSON object with array inside of it and it can be seen in Chrome DevTools under Network section.</p>

<p>Problem is that JavaScript shows me that response text is undefined. I've been trying to solve this for 3 hours and I can't figure it out.</p>

<p>Here's the JS code:</p>

            var url = 'feed.php';

            var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
            request.open( method, url + params, true );
            request.setRequestHeader( 'Content-Type', 'application/json; charset=utf-8' );

                        for ( var i in list ) {
                            i.push( self.news.list );

<p>I am suffering from that distinctive fatigue one gets when trying to do simple UNIXy things in Max OSX.  Can someone tell me how to use sed (not awk, not perl, not anything but sed) to take file.txt containing this:</p>

<p>Thank you very much if you actually do this on in Mac OSX Lion. (edit: not Mountain Lion, either, a different OS). I just spent a long time Googling folks who answer for linux or UNIX in general, it's not much help sadly.</p>

<p>I tried a number of things from the blissful, long-forgotten days of standard pattern matching, when one could rattle off UNIXy commands and lo! they would behave:</p>

<pre><code>cat file.txt | sed 's/ */ /g'        - O h m y I h a v e M a c f a t i g u e
cat file.txt | sed 's/ \+/ /g'       - no effect
cat file.txt | sed 's/\s\+/ /g'      - no effect
cat file.txt | sed -E -e 's/ */ /g'  - O h m y I h a v e M a c f a t i g u e
</code></pre>

<p>Telling me to use sed on a linux machine will make me smile, but it won't get an upvote :)
Thanks in advance.  Not sure what I'd do without StackOverflow.</p>

If you hover over the text in chrome you can see that even if you go ouside(upwards) of the text it's still highlighted</p>

<p>Using the chrome inspector it seems the element is actually a rectangle with the text drawn inside it, is there a way to make the events only apply to the rendered text and NOT the whole element? as in Firefox/IE?</p>

<p>Now there is this proposal to use WCF for AJAX, and i'm a little sceptical.  I would like to keep and open mind.  To me it seems to add another layer, unnecessarily complicating things.  Is this worth it?</p>

Those thumbnails are simple images - first frames of those GIFs. My problem is that whenever user opens this <code>ViewController</code> approx. 50MB of memory is allocated and never released. This memory is allocated during loading those thumbnails and when this <code>ViewController</code> is unloaded (user taps back button) all this memory remains blocked, so if I open this <code>ViewController</code> several times in a row, I get memory warnings and shortly after that the app crashes.</p>

<p>On this <code>ViewController</code> I have simple <code>array</code> for storing local <code>NSURLs</code> for those GIFs and nothing more. This code allocates all the memory and is being run from UICollectionView's <code>cellForItemAtIndexPath</code> data source method:</p>

<pre><code>func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -&gt; UICollectionViewCell {
    var cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier(cellIdentifierRegular, forIndexPath: indexPath) as! THCellMyGIFs

    let urlLocal = self.arrLocalURLs[indexPath.item]
    let data = NSData(contentsOfURL: urlLocal)
    let imageSource = CGImageSourceCreateWithData(data, [""0"":""0""])
    let frameImageRef = CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex(imageSource, 0, [""0"":""0""])
    let thumbImage = UIImage(CGImage: frameImageRef) 
    cell.imvGif.image = thumbImage

    return cell
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't mind that 50MB of memory is allocated while this view controller is opened (it's simply the size of those images, so everything is OK), but I want to release them when it's closed. In my opinion the problem is in <code>CGImageSourceCreate</code> methods, but since the app uses ARC I'm not allowed to use <code>CFRelease</code> or <code>CGImageRelease</code> (as recommended in documentation). I've tried to rewrite those lines in Obj-C, disallowed ARC in that file and manually release the memory there, but that didn't help. Any ideas?</p>

<p>See where it says tddjdjck and how it is indented quite a lot. That is what I want (I used <code>setPadding</code> with left and right set to 50), but I also want the blue line under it to be indented too. How do I do that?</p>

<p>The code I am using is below:</p>

<pre><code>            final AlertDialog.Builder alert = new AlertDialog.Builder(thisActivity);
            final EditText input = new EditText(thisActivity);
            input.setSingleLine();
            input.setPadding(50, 0, 50, 0);

            alert.setTitle(""by..."");
            alert.setMessage(""enter the name of the person who did:"");
            alert.setView(input);

<p>I have a program that needs to take the <code>sqrt()</code> of something, but that's the only thing I need from <code>math</code>. It seems a bit wasteful to import the entire module to grab a single function. </p>

<p>I could say <code>from math import sqrt</code>, but then <code>sqrt()</code> would be added to my program's main namespace and I don't want that (especially since I plan to alter the program to be usable as a module; would importing like that cause problems in that situation?). Is there any way to import only that one function while still retaining the <code>math.sqrt()</code> syntax?</p>

<p>I'm using Python 2.7 in this specific case, but if there's a different answer for Python 3 I'd like to hear that too for future reference.</p>

<p>I installed DevIL via homebrew. First i changed the Formula, because i need ILUT:</p>

<pre><code>brew edit devil
</code></pre>

<p>then edited these lines</p>

<pre><code>def install
  system ""./configure"", ""--disable-debug"", ""--disable-dependency-tracking"",
                        ""--prefix=#{prefix}"", ""--enable-ILU""
  system ""make install""
end
</code></pre>

<p>like so</p>

<pre><code>def install
  system ""./configure"", ""--disable-debug"", ""--disable-dependency-tracking"",
                        ""--prefix=#{prefix}"", ""--enable-ILU"", ""--enable-ILUT""
  system ""make install""
end
</code></pre>

<p>and installed everything with</p>

<pre><code>[sudo] brew install devil
</code></pre>

<p>which gives me the DevIL headers in <code>/usr/local/include/</code> and the dynamic libraries in <code>/usr/local/lib/</code>. Next, i added the libraries to my project with the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Right-click on my only Target</li>
<li>Click ""Add > Existing Frameworks""</li>
<li>Select ""Dylibs""</li>
<li>Add <code>libIL.dylib</code>, <code>libILU.dylib</code> and <code>libILUT.dylib</code></li>
</ul>

<p>(there are also <code>libIL.1.dylib</code>, <code>libILU.1.dylib</code> and <code>libILUT.1.dylib</code> available in the list, is that normal?)</p>

<p>Then i added the following flags in ""Project > Edit Project Settings > Build > Other Linker Flags"":</p>

<pre><code>-lil -lilu -lilut

However, I have tried this and the outcome is it is just posting the array entered twice and does not clear the first set. I have an action shown below when a button is pressed both times; the first is to enter the data entered (I have the same code 4 times for the 4 different possible objects to enter but just put in the one since it's basically the same), which works fine and the second is to remove a specific one shown. My code is long, so am just putting that in. If someone wants something else please let me know. Thanks, I'd appreciate any input!</p>

<p>It looks like it's not even entering the for loop in <code>unsubscribeFromService()</code> which I believe means that the table it's being passed is empty for some reason. Is there ever a situation where a table wouldn't be passed by reference in Lua? It might explain this behavior as I've broken down the smaller components and tested them individually and they seem to be working.</p>

<p>I need to do this since i have to write the large string to a PDF file line by line (i have to call the newline API of the dll i'm using after writing the preceding line).</p>

<p>Here is the short version of the code:-</p>

<pre><code>    string fileContents = ""abc\r\n\r\ndef\r\nghi"";

    int pos = -1; 

    int start = 0;

    while ((pos = fileContents.IndexOf(""\r\n"", start)) != -1)
    {

        //write string to PDF
        //call newline API

        start = pos + 1;

    }

<p>The expected positions of ""\r\n"" in fileContents variable are 3,7 and 14. However, on debugging the code, the values in pos variable are 3, 5 and 10.</p>

So in a one step of this implementation sensor nodes have a certificate of a CA. Sensors are supposed to generate a symmetric key and encrypt it with CA's public key and send it to the CA. </p>

<p>I use openssl for certificate and key generations. I though of using AES with 128bit key for the symmetric key. The problem for the moment is that I can't encrypt 128bit data as follows since it gives ""Data is too large"" error.</p>

<pre><code>openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey id_rsa.pub.pem -pubin -in key1.bin -out key1.bin.enc 
</code></pre>

<p>So it looks like either I need to encrypt 128 bit key using another way or I can use a smaller key which in sensor network environment will not be a problem. </p>

<p>My question is ""Is there any symmetric key encryption with smaller key or do I have a way to encrypt 128bit key using the certificate directly""</p>

<p>P.S</p>

<p>This is how I generate keys.</p>

<pre><code>openssl genrsa -out mykey.pem 1024
openssl rsa -in mykey.pem -pubout &gt; mykey.pub
openssl rand 128 &gt; key1.bin

<p>It works fine on dozens of different machines, including XP, Win7 and at least one Windows8 VM. </p>

<p>We have encountered one Acer ZS600 which has Win8 on it, and we're seeing a bizarre effect I can't figure out.</p>

<p>When you capture, it grabs an image of the correct size, but the wrong position. It is offset to the top and left. Not by a fixed amount. When the capture window is at the screen 0,0 position it is fine, but as you move the capture window away from origin, the offset increases. </p>

<p>I've been though the code and found that the window position (this.Top and this.Left) are reporting the wrong numbers. </p>

<p>Even more strangely, we have tried this on an Acer Z5771, which is virtually the same hardware setup, except it uses Windows 7. We have tried updating the Zs600 graphics driver, but it had no effect. </p>

<p>Does anyone understand this, or suggest a fix or workaround?</p>

<p>Edit: I've put together a simple app which, on the problem machine, shows the effect. On my dev machine it works fine.

I can use DotRas, but the connection fails 9 of 10 times, because of some keys DotRas don't set correctly.
I can connect using: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>rasdail entryname user pass /PHONEBOOK:mypath</p>

<p>The problem is how to create an entry (the custom phone book here is nod needed and it don't concern my question, I can use the default as well), I even know what keys to use, so I can create it from string, but the problem is in those 4 keys:</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>LowDateTime= HighDateTime= DialParamsUID= Guid=</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>I vaguely know what're those for, but I can't find good explanation how they are created. Windows documentation says:</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>LowDateTime= - This key is optional and if present MUST be ignored by
  RRAS HighDateTime=30428537 - This key is optional and if present MUST
  be ignored by RRAS DialParamsUID=2945250 - This key specifies a unique
  identifier (an 8-bit ASCII-encoded string representation of a decimal
  number)   to be used on RRAS for use as a credential key for
  demand-dial connection. This key is optional. Guid= - This key
  specifies a unique identifier (GUID) for this RRAS entry. This key is
  optional.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Those are all optional and even omitted according to Microsoft documentation, but when I change one of those the connection fails with error 800, which I don't have an idea why. 
I can obviously create the entry with DotRas and change some keys, assuming the problem is not in those flags, and I'm not so sure in this, or I can try to  automate and hide the vpn creation GUI in windows, but both the ideas look very ugly to me...</p>

on the approach to Test-Driven Development for the work I'm carrying out.</p>

<p>I am working on a ASP.NET MVC3 project that parses in a physical XML file (containing chart and table data).
First the app generates a model representation of the xml nodes.
The controller is there to carriy out the application logic,<br>
that ultimately renders to a specific HTML view with charts and tables.</p>

<p>I am thinking that I will be building a model that represents the xml ie classes like dataset,header,dimension etc with 
appropriate interfaces. Is this the right approach. (Please see below the sample xml)</p>

<p>What sort of units tests would I write?
Would I start with unit tests that access the physical XML files (probably not)?
Should I stream fragmetns of xml strings into an Xdocument? (isn't that teting .net code?)
Presuming I don't want to create concrete XDocument classes, how do I mock out the object eg</p>

<p>First test I want to do (I think) is to load the xml and test the end_Date is correct</p>

<p>I have a XMLHelper Class that loads the xml and returns a class representation of a header with property end date. </p>

<p>So my concrete code would look something roughly like</p>

<pre><code>var dataset = XmlHelper.Load(filePathOrXmlStream);
var header=dataset.Header;

Assert.AreEqual(""5/06/2011"",header.EndDate);
</code></pre>

<p>presume that the below XML is used for the stream or file load.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to build is relatively simple. A slot machine-like interface with ""rolling"" images that eventually will slow down and stop. I'm using jQuery's .slideUp() function to do so, and it works well when applied to a single panel. But when applied to a second or third, the animation start acting weird.</p>

<p>Try this demo to see what I mean : <a href=""http://bit.ly/wtiq36"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/wtiq36</a></p>

<p>Anyone know what's going on? The technique I'm using to simulate the animation is pretty straightforward, I just pile all the images onto the other, and swap the highest z-index for the lowest z-index-1 to put it back at the end of the stack once the slideUp() is finished.</p>

<p>(p.s. I am aware this loops infinitely, that part is not done yet :))</p>

<p>2) move all constructors to an init() function in each class. This is counter intuitive to how we work, and may also cause a mess with things that can only be initialized with an initializer list.</p>

Actually I have to program, mostly in awk, or ruby, some bash.</p>

<p>In today's task, I have a huge data set (float numbers) in a plain text file, one record/line, and a sum of all numbers of the set, but the sum is wrong, because some of the numbers (can be only one) in the set is negative, but we can't see it in the file (there's no sign if an element is negative).</p>

<p>But I have to find it/them: so first I had calculated the correct total sum (with adding all the numbers with <code>awk</code>) didn't care about their signs.
Now I now the difference between the original sum (which cared about signs) and my new total sum. But I have to find all the subsets of the dataset, which has the exact same sum like the difference/2.</p>

<p>E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>DATA:
1,2,3,4,5

ORIG SUM: 
5
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can calculate the difference between 1+2+3+4+5 - ORIG SUM: 15-5=10. 10/2 = 5, so I need to find all the subsets which can add up to 5, that is [1,4],[2,3],[5].</p>

<p>Is there a proper way to do it? I prefer awk, ruby, shell scripting, but both python and perl is acceptable (without heavy uses of external libraries, as I've got no right to install them).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

I manage to implement a Draggable modifier in each scrollview item, so the items can be dragged (X axis), but now I can't be able to capture the event of the draggable modifier in order to trigger the actions.</p>

<p>Here is my ListView class:</p>

<pre><code>define(function(require, exports, module) {

    ListView.prototype.constructor = ListView;

    ListView.prototype.setContent = function(data) {
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; data.length; i++) {
            var item = new Surface({

            var draggable = new Draggable({

            var node = new RenderNode(draggable);

    };


    module.exports = ListView;

<p>Now App Class where I include my ListView:</p>

<pre><code>define(function(require, exports, module) {

        ...

        this.list = new ListView();
        this.list.pipe(this._eventInput);
        this._eventInput.on('swipe', this.swipeListItem.bind(this)) // Trying to captute swipe event

        this.list.setContent([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]);

 $links.not($active).each(function () {

 $(""html, body"").animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, ""fast"");
// Bind the click event handler
 $(this).on('click', 'a', function(e){
 $(""html, body"").animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, ""fast"");
// Make the old tab inactive.
 $active.parent().siblings().removeClass('active');
 $active.parent().removeClass('active');
 $content.hide();
// Update the variables with the new link and content
 $active = $(this);
 $content = $($(this).attr('href'));

<p>It seems like a function similar to this should work to center the .active element in the viewport, but something must be wrong with my understanding/approach:</p>

<pre><code>function scrollMenu(){
$viewportWidth = $('.subnav').width(),
$activeTab = $('ul').find('li.active'),
$elWidth = $activeTab.width(),
$elOffset = $activeTab.offset();

<p>It works well but I can't seem to exit a running callback function using return; or return true;. the consquence is that when the condition to ""exit"" is met, it stops all remaining $.forEach ""loop"" execution.</p>

<p>Since the plugin implements a setTimeout loop approach, perhaps I just need to know how to exit an already running setTimeout callback function?

<pre><code>$.forEach(json, 1000, function(idx,item) {
    if(some_condition) return true; //exit this timeout iteration

    //otherwise do something
});

jQuery.forEach = function (in_array, in_pause_ms, in_callback)

The auto-generated SWFs are also Flash 8 (actually, they work at least in 7, possibly even older), so my current app is able to directly reference variables and functions within the embedded SWF.</p>

<p>We're now working on a new version of this application, written in Flex.  We need to duplicate the current app's functionality of embedding and controlling the auto-generated AS2 SWFs.  However, AS3-based SWFs can't reference variables or functions within an embedded AS2-based SWF.  Unfortunately we don't have control over the auto-generation tool, so we can't change that to output AS3-based SWFs.</p>

<p>The only real solution to getting the AS3 and AS2 SWFs to communicate is to use LocalConnection.  I'd need to create a wrapper AS2 SWF that would load the auto-generated SWF and act as a proxy, communicating with my Flex app via LocalConnection and doing whatever needs to be done to the auto-generated SWF.  However, there's a problem with this.  The proxy SWF needs to know what LocalConnection ID to use, but I can't find a way to communicate the ID to it (I can't just hard-code some random ID as I need to be able to support multiple instances of this app simultaneously).</p>

<p>For GUI app written in wxPython or pyQT, the user needs to install wxWidget or QT in her box first, which is an extra step, and then install my GUI app. (But my Ubuntu box seems to have the wxWidget libraries and QT libraries installed by default, is that a norm or just Ubuntu distro is more friendly to users?

<p>Is there a problem in using VLC player as root in Ubuntu?</p>

<pre><code>using System;

{
    class Item

        private string name;

Console.WriteLine(item1.Description);
Console.ReadLine();

<p>By ""doesn't work"" I mean when I click on ""Start debugging"", the console window appears but nothing is there, it's blank. However, this works fine:</p>

<pre><code>Console.WriteLine(item1); // ToString()
Console.ReadLine();

"17079029","1","17081998","","2013-06-13 04:05:13","","1","535","<p>I worked on getting a color picker together, which I plan on using to control the color selection for sketching with <a href=""https://github.com/intridea/sketch.js"" rel=""nofollow"">Sketch.js</a>. According to Sketch.js documentation, the 'marker' tool will obtain it's color information from any  tag that includes a 'data-color' field, and points to the canvas id, like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#myCanvas"" data-color=""""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My color slider, found <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/t2PDc/3/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, is now sending the hsl/rgb data to the box seen under the slider in the fiddle example. I'd like to remove the box completely, and just send the value of the slider to the value of the marker tool. I've seen while inspecting elements on my test page that jquery-ui.js controls the creation of the element that contains the slider, on line 12691 of jquery-ui.js is the following function:</p>

<pre><code>    _createHandles: function() {
    var i, handleCount,
        options = this.options,
        existingHandles = this.element.find( "".ui-slider-handle"" ).addClass( ""ui-state-default ui-corner-all"" ),
        handle = ""&lt;a id='slider-handle' class='ui-slider-handle ui-state-default ui-corner-all' href='#'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"",
        handles = [];
</code></pre>

<p>So I tried adding my canvas id and the data-color field to this so that:</p>

<pre><code>handle = ""&lt;a href='#myCanvas' data-color='' id='slider-handle' class='ui-slider-handle ui-state-default ui-corner-all'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;""
</code></pre>

<p>I then watched the output with my very own eyes in the console, the slider takes on the value, but for some reason when drawing, the marker tool does not change colors. It only changes colors with the box when the box is clicked. I know I'm missing something easy here, any help appreciated in getting rid of the box.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Perhaps Sketch.js will only accept hex values as input, going to try to convert the hsl/rgb to hex and see if that works.
EDIT 2:
This is not the case, I attempted to change the values for a clickbox in real-time in the console to an hsl value and Sketch.js drew that color.</p>

"24089680","1","","","2014-06-06 19:53:32","","2","92","<p>I have a problem with knitr caching an R chunk containing a call to the matchit() function in the package MatchIt, using the ""genetic"" algorithm implemented in the packages Matching and rgenoud : this chunk is executed at <em>each</em> and <em>every</em> compilation. This is a double pain :</p>

<ul>
<li>The genetic algorithm uses simulations ==> slight variations in results (my student will faint at the notion of a change on the third ""significant"" decimal of a p.value...)</li>
<li>Damnably time consuming (propensity score matching is harder than you think, especially on small samples).</li>
</ul>

<p>I have managed to reduce this to a ""minimal reproducible example"" which is not <em>that</em> minimal Rnw-wise (about 5 Kb .Rnw file including a serious bit of preambule), and needs quite unminimal data (80 Kb .csv data) and a small .bib file. Anyway, there seems to exist no way to attach files to a stackoverflow question...</p>

<p>I tried to reduce the dependency of data files by adding an explicit dependency on the MD5 sums with the cache.extra option. No success</p>

<p>I also specified explicit dependencies with dependspon(). No luck.</p>

<p>I also asked this question (with example an data) to Yihui Xie (got no answer, but the guy might have a PhD to defend, after all...).</p>

<p>For now, I work around the difficulty with poor man's caching (testing if the objevt exists and executing code only if it does not), but of course I lose consistency, <em>which is the whole point of using knitr !</em></p>

<p>If some kind soul is interested in my problem, I can send him a tarball with the example.</p>

<p>Any hint ?</p>

The requirement is that only one item in the collection may have the databound boolean property set to true at a given time.  The data object is named Interval, the Property in question is Program:</p>

<pre><code>public bool Program
{
    get { return _program; }
    set
    {
        if (value)
        {

<p>My expected behavior would be that clicking the databound checkbox would set the Program property for one instance of Interval to true, and in so doing, would set the Program property on all other instances to false.  That is indeed what happens, however the datagridview does not update correctly.  It will leave previous checkboxes checked and after tabbing off the cell or mousing over another checkbox, then it will update that particular checkbox.  </p>

Because i want to create rest-services using spring with <code>ContentNegotiatingViewResolver</code>. After debugging, i found <code>InvocableHandlerMethdod</code> class in which <code>invokeForRequest</code> method contain following argument:</p>

I did some refactoring and now <code>SIZE_MAX</code> is not defined in one of the modules. This problem appeared when <a href=""http://travis-ci.org"">Travis-CI</a> attempted to build the project on Linux. It worked fine before I refactored stuff, but tracing which exact header files were included is difficult.</p>

<p>In an attempt to replicate the problem locally, I installed an Ubuntu VM with the default gcc and was able to reproduce it. Here's the relevant source:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;

int main()
{
    size_t a = SIZE_MAX;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The command line is simply:</p>

<pre><code>g++ a.cpp
</code></pre>

<p>The error is:</p>

<pre><code>a.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
a.cpp:5:16: error: ‘SIZE_MAX’ was not declared in this scope
</code></pre>

<p>System info:</p>

<pre><code>$ uname -a
Linux quartz 3.11.0-15-generic #25~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 30 17:39:31 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
$ gcc --version
gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5) 4.6.3
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried including <code>cstdint</code>, <code>stdint.h</code>, <code>limits.h</code>, <code>inttypes.h</code>, <code>stdio.h</code>, <code>stdlib.h</code>, and probably some others, and I can't figure out which specific header file I need for <code>SIZE_MAX</code>.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the program I'm working on compiled fine, with <code>SIZE_MAX</code> used in various places, before I made some changes. The changes I made caused it to become undefined in <em>one</em> <code>.cpp</code> source file where it was used (the others continue to be fine). So there exists <em>some</em> header file on my system where it is correctly defined.</p>

But TeX is a Turing-complete language, and it is arguably a general-purpose compiler/interpreter. Does that make it unacceptable to the App Store? Furthermore, if somebody ports TeX compiler to javascript and runs inside WebKit, does it make acceptable to the App Store?</p>

<p>FYI, here's the section of the developer's agreement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.3.2 An Application may not itself install or launch other executable code by any means, including without limitation through the use of a plug-in architecture, calling other frameworks, other APIs or otherwise. No interpreted code may be downloaded and used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple's Published APIs and builtin interpreter(s).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update</strong> (Jun.11.2010) Apple changed the section as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.3.2 Unless otherwise approved by Apple in writing, no interpreted code may be downloaded or used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple’s Documented APIs and built-in interpreter(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with Apple’s prior written consent, an Application may use embedded interpreted code in a limited way if such use is solely for providing minor features or functionality that are consistent with the intended and advertised purpose of the Application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which might open the way to having TeX on iPad.</p>

<p><strong>Another Update</strong> (Sep.10.2010) Apple caved in to the outside pressure (maybe the antitrust investigation?)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.3.2 An Application may not download or install executable code. Interpreted code may only be used in an Application if all scripts, code and interpreters are packaged in the Application and not downloaded. The only exception to the foregoing is scripts and code downloaded and run by Apple’s built-in WebKit framework.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess now it's perfectly OK to have TeX on iPad. Who is going to port a TeX distribution?</p>

<p>The typical approach for 1 consumer and 1 producer looks like this : </p>

<pre><code>Producer : 
    while(true)
        emptyBuffers.P();
        mutex.P();
        buffer.insert(produced item);
        mutex.V();
        fullBuffers.V();

Consumer : 
    while(true)
        fullBuffers.P();
        mutex.P();
        buffer.consume(consumed item);
        mutex.V();
        emptyBuffers.V();
</code></pre>

<p>Why will this not work if I have more than 1 producer and/or more than 1 consumer? I've looked everywhere, but I can't find an answer I understand :s.</p>

<p>The mutex semaphore makes sure there are no 2 processes working in the buffer at the same time, so I don't see how this property can possibly change if you have more processes... </p>

<p>The 'solution' is that you change the mutex into a ProducerMutex and a ConsumerMutex. But now that would mean a producer and a consumer CAN be in the buffer at the same time, which should not be allowed, right?</p>

<p>I'm really not getting this :s</p>

<p>If I have high resolution images and sprites that I want to use, should i work with a screen that like 1080x1920 and than create some methods that scale down for lower resolution screen? Or should I try to compress it down to some middle ground resolution and scale up and down as necessary?</p>

<p>Also can anyone give me a good example of how to to the scaling for different resolutions? Would I for example see what the ratio between my player sprite and my original screen (lets say 1/6 of the width and height) and when the resolution changes i just try to keep this ratio? Or is there a better way to do this? </p>

I've found that I <strong>can</strong> use a vector of column numbers, but <strong>not</strong> with the column names. In regards to the ""select"" argument, the documentation just says ""Vector of column names or numbers to keep, drop the rest."" They also provide the example of</p>

<pre><code>fread(data, select=c(""A"",""D""))
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, why does my code throw a <em>subscript out of bounds</em> error? Here's the gist of my code, hopefully generalizable to other users:</p>

<pre><code>test = data.frame(matrix(c(1:50),ncol = 5))
names(test) = c(""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"")
write.table(test, file = ""/Users/me/Desktop/test.txt"", sep = "","")
fread(""/Users/me/Desktop/test.txt"", sep = "","", header = TRUE, select = c(""A"",""B""))
</code></pre>

<p>Giving </p>

<pre><code>Error in ans[[1]] : subscript out of bounds
</code></pre>

<p>However this gives the first column as well as the row number as a column:</p>

<pre><code>fread(""/Users/me/Desktop/test.txt"", sep = "","", header = TRUE, select = c(1,2))
    1  1
1:  2  2
2:  3  3
3:  4  4
4:  5  5
5:  6  6
6:  7  7
7:  8  8
8:  9  9
9: 10 10
</code></pre>

<p>...And read.table() is able to uneventfully read the whole data set:</p>

<pre><code>read.table(""/Users/me/Desktop/test.txt"", sep = "","", header = TRUE)
    A  B  C  D  E
1   1 11 21 31 41
2   2 12 22 32 42
3   3 13 23 33 43

9   9 19 29 39 49
10 10 20 30 40 50
</code></pre>

<p>Something is obviously going on with the rownames and the header, but I'm not sure how to resolve it. I've tried with and without headers. The data set I'm using (not in this example) already has rownames, so re-writing it with rownames = FALSE isn't an option. </p>

<p>I'm trying to understand how the <code>ItemsSource</code> and <code>DataContext</code> properties work in a Silverlight Toolkit <code>DataGrid</code>.  I'm currently working with dummy data and trying to get the data in the <code>DataGrid</code> to update when the value of a combo box changes.</p>

<p>My MainPage.xaml.vb file currently looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Partial Public Class MainPage
    Inherits UserControl

Private IssueSummaryList As List(Of IssueSummary)    

Public Sub New()
    GetDummyIssueSummary(""Day"")
    InitializeComponent()
    dgIssueSummary.ItemsSource = IssueSummaryList
    'dgIssueSummary.DataContext = IssueSummaryList        '
End Sub

Private Sub GetDummyIssueSummary(ByVal timeInterval As String)
    Dim lst As New List(Of IssueSummary)()
    'Generate dummy data for lst '
    IssueSummaryList = lst
End Sub

Private Sub ComboBox_SelectionChanged(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Controls.SelectionChangedEventArgs)
    Dim cboBox As ComboBox = CType(sender, ComboBox)
    Dim cboBoxItem As ComboBoxItem = CType(cboBox.SelectedValue, ComboBoxItem)
    GetDummyIssueSummary(cboBoxItem.Content.ToString())
End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>My XAML currently looks this for the <code>DataGrid</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;sdk:DataGrid x:Name=""dgIssueSummary"" AutoGenerateColumns=""False"" &gt;
    &lt;sdk:DataGrid.Columns&gt;
        &lt;sdk:DataGridTextColumn Binding=""{Binding ProblemType}"" Header=""Problem Type""/&gt;
        &lt;sdk:DataGridTextColumn Binding=""{Binding Count}"" Header=""Count""/&gt;
    &lt;/sdk:DataGrid.Columns&gt;
&lt;/sdk:DataGrid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that if I set the value of the <code>ItemsSource</code> property of the data grid equal to <code>IssueSummaryList</code>, it will display the data when it loads, but it won't update when the underlying <code>IssueSummaryList</code> collection changes.  If I set the <code>DataContext</code> of the grid to be <code>IssueSummaryList</code>, no data will be displayed when it renders.</p>

<p>I must not understand how <code>ItemsSource</code> and <code>DataContext</code> are supposed to function, because I expect one of those properties to ""just work"" when I assign a <code>List</code> object to them.  What do I need to understand and change in my code so that as data changes in the <code>List</code>, the data in the grid is updated?</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's what I did to solve the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, I changed <code>IssueSummaryList</code> to be of type <code>System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection</code>.  The <code>ObservableCollection</code> object raises events when items are added or removed from the collection, telling the datagrid to refresh its view.</li>
<li>Next, I changed the <code>GetDummyIssueSummary()</code> method to modify <code>IssueSummaryList</code> directly instead of setting it to a new instance of a <code>List</code> or <code>ObservableCollection</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two changes allowed the data grid to refresh when the combo box changed.</p>

As you can see from the sample below, I also have a column in <code>d</code> called <code>flag</code>. What I want is to be able to visualize <code>flag</code> by changing the border color of the bar to the color red.</p>

<pre><code># create reproducible data
library(ggplot2)
d &lt;- read.csv(text='Day,Location,Length,Amount,flag

    3,3,3,1.8,TRUE

    3,1,3,1.1,FALSE',header=T)
ggplot(d, aes(x = Day, y = Length)) + 
geom_bar(aes(fill = Amount, order = -Location), stat = ""identity"")
</code></pre>

<p>I have experimented with <code>alpha</code> and that certainly does flag the desired bar but fails to visualize the data in the way I want:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(d, aes(x = Day, y = Length)) + 
geom_bar(aes(fill = Amount, order = -Location, alpha = -flag), stat = ""identity"")
</code></pre>

<p><code>alpha</code> when using <code>-flags</code> (note <code>-</code>)also messes with the legend, which is undesirable. </p>

<p>Using the below command returns an error that I need 2 colour variables, but I only want 1, <code>red</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(d, aes(x = Day, y = Length)) + 
geom_bar(aes(fill = Amount, order = -Location, alpha = -flag), stat = ""identity"") + 
scale_colour_manual(values = alpha(c('red')))
</code></pre>

<p>To recap:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I want to show the bar where <code>flag = TRUE</code> with a red outline (or something equally as noticeable) without changing the continuous scale already decided by <code>Amount</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>I want the legend to reflect that <code>flag = TRUE</code> with the colour red (or whatever matches).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, which one should I use for my main menu? <code>Nav</code>, or <code>Menu</code>? Does it matter?</p>

<h1>Update:</h1>

<p>After doing some more reading, I've not found a direct answer, however it is pretty clear now.</p>

<p>On <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/nav.html"">http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/nav.html</a> W3C states that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The nav element represents a section of
  a document that links to other
  documents or to parts within the
  document itself; that is, a section of
  navigation links.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And on <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/menu.html"">http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/menu.html</a> they say </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The menu element represents a list of commands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So based off of that, I think the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element would be more suited to a Main Menu. Unless the Main Menu contains Context Menu's and a list of form control commands, in which case a <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> element would be a better fit. Hmm. I can feel my brain going around and around in circles again.</p>

<p>What I need is a primarily a queue where each queue item is added by a producer. The work to be done on the queue items must be synchronous (only one item is allowed to be worked on at a time). However, the items are temporal. When a producer goes to add work to the queue, if the queue already has work added by that producer, the queue item expires and instead of removing it from the queue, the item is replaced with the producers new item as I do not want that producer to lose their position in the queue.</p>

<p>So the rules of the queue are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Items being pulled from the queue are one at a time. This is simple enough, it is a queue after all...</p></li>
<li><p>Items can be added to the queue by multiple producers simultaneously.</p></li>
<li><p>If a producer already has an item in the queue, the queue item is replaced with the producers new item.</p></li>
<li><p>Items cannot be pulled from the queue while an item is being added to the queue (this is so that items that are being modified cannot be pulled until they are modified)</p></li>
<li><p>Producers do not necessarily need to have items in the queue, each producer can go extended periods of time with no work to be done.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any ideas on how such a structure could be implemented or of an existing data structure that fits the need would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>1) Added iAd.framework into iOS project. i imported iAd/iAd.h and .m into project.</p>

<p>2) I opened AdMob account. In mediation i made iAd cpm higher than AdMob cpm.</p>

<p>3) Downloaded the AdMob SDK iOS 7.0 SDK into project and it comes with AdMob adapter. Imported GoogleMobileAds into .h and .m files in project</p>

<p>4) Downloaded the iAd adapter into project.</p>

<p>5) Under Build Settings in Other linker flags I added -ObjC so it's in debug and release.</p>

<p>It states in Admob Mediation instructions ""There is no need to write additional code to create ad views from each ad network. The AdMob mediation SDK will invoke each ad network's adapters and SDK as necessary to create ads""</p>

<p>Not adding any code, doesn't work.</p>

<p>I have 1 ViewController for ads to share. 3 methods in that 1 VC. 1st= viewDidLoad method, 2nd= StartGame method, and 3rd= GameOver method. Then back to viewDidLoad after GameOver.</p>

<p>So Then I added iad code in viewDidLoad and made iad hide in didFailToReceiveAdWithError and AdMob show.</p>

<p>This made iAd load and iAd stays showing test banner for like 5 minutes before it fails and AdMob loads. However, AdMob instantly changes back to iAd after I leave the GameOver page and go back to viewDidLoad.</p>

<p>So I don't think mediation is working properly because the ad banners aren't supposed to be affected by any of the methods. What did I do wrong? How do I set up mediation properly?</p>

<p>Why all other methods not made default in Java 8? Compatibility shouldn't be an issue, for example, <code>Iterator.remove()</code> was abstract until Java 7, but made default since Java 8.</p>

<p>Subclassing from <code>AbstractCollection</code> is inconvenient sometimes, when I want a <code>Collection</code> implementation to be a member of another class hierarchy. Wasn't that one of the reasons why default methods in interfaces actually needed in Java?</p>

<p>The same question about <code>Map</code>, <code>List</code> and other basic interfaces, comprising Java Collection Framework.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Paul Sandoz:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally we have only converted existing abstract methods on an interface to non-abstract if there was a compelling reason to aid implementations, such as Iterator.remove.</p>
  
  <p>These are not new methods on Collection, and there are already implementations in AbstractCollection. The advantage of converting these abstract into non-abstract methods its not particularly compelling given one is most likely to inherit from AbstractCollection or provide more efficient implementations.</p>
  
  <p>It would be possible to move all non-abstract methods on AbstractCollection to Collection. If we were starting from a blank sheet of paper that is what we might have done. (Note one cannot do this with all non-abstract methods on AbstractList.)</p>

The App should do the following thing: It should generate a new Alarm to a time specified in the preferences (Which it already does...) also in Logcat i can see how the Alarm gets triggered. But the problem is, that the Notification which should be shown does not show up in the StatusBar.</p>

<p>Here is all the code i have for this:</p>

    &lt;/receiver&gt;

<p>AlarmService.java:</p>

<pre><code>private Context context;
private PendingIntent mAlarmSender;

public AlarmService(Context context) {
    this.context = context;
    Intent notifyIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MAIN);
    notifyIntent.setClass(context, myActivity.class);
    mAlarmSender = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, 0, notifyIntent, 0);
}

public void startAlarm(int stunde, int minute) {
    Calendar updateTime = Calendar.getInstance();

    updateTime.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, stunde);
    updateTime.set(Calendar.MINUTE, minute);
    updateTime.set(Calendar.SECOND, 00);

    AlarmManager am = (AlarmManager) context
            .getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);
    am.setRepeating(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, updateTime.getTimeInMillis(),
            AlarmManager.INTERVAL_DAY, mAlarmSender);
}

<p>TimeAlarm.java:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.e(""TEST"", ""onReceive() called..."");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Receiver in the Manifest is inside of the  Tag so that should not be a problem.
The problem is, that if i restart my device, it gets called. But not if an Alarm gets triggered.
But the onReceive() method should also be called if an alarm gets triggered, shouldn't it?</p>

<p>The algorithm to implement this change is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>For each Nx × Ny plane, Ny 1D FFTs along x dimension.</li>
<li>Matrix transposition of each Nx × Ny plane.</li>
<li>For each Nx × Ny plane, Ny 1D FFTs along current x dimension.</li>
<li>Matrix transposition of each current Nx × Nz plane.</li>
<li>For each current Nx × Ny plane, Ny 1D FFTs along x dimension.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the 3D FFT I am doing something as:</p>

<pre><code>fftw_plan p;
double *grid;

//grid init, other stuff

p = fftw_plan_dft_r2c_3d(grid_size, grid_size, grid_size, grid, grid , FFTW_MEASURE) ;
fftw_execute(p);
</code></pre>

<p>I see there is a similar function for 1D FFT, fftw_plan_dft_r2c_1d, but I don't know which is the best way to use it or if it's the best idea to my goal. </p>

<p>Is a valid option to create a 2D array of plans, and use them on the function previously mentioned? If so, how should I declare or initialize those plans?</p>

<p>Additionally, how can I do an efficient transposition on Nx and Nz plane on the 4th point, since they are not in contiguous memory positions?</p>

I have the rdl files uploaded to an ssrs server and I am developing a custom ui that utilizes the ssrs endpoint (sql2008r2) for the retrieval and filtering of the reports. 
Where I am looking for some guidance is on what exactly needs to be provided to the report for loading it? 
Initally I started out with trying to use local processing but based upon what I have read as well as the environmental requirements I need to use report processing for generating the reports.
In the aspx file I have added the report viewer:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:UpdatePanel ID=""ReportViewPanel""  runat=""server"" UpdateMode=""Conditional""&gt;
  &lt;ContentTemplate&gt;
     &lt;rsweb:ReportViewer ID=""MyReportViewer"" runat=""server""&gt;
         &lt;/rsweb:ReportViewer&gt;
  &lt;/ContentTemplate&gt;
&lt;/asp:UpdatePanel&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And in the code behind once a link is clicked I try to load the report as follows:</p>

<pre><code>//code that creates the report link buttons based on what is returned from endpoint    
protected void RenderReportLinks(System.Web.UI.WebControls.Panel p, List&lt;ReportItems&gt; items)
{
   p.Controls.Add(new LiteralControl(""&lt;ul class='HorizontalList'&gt;""));
   foreach (var r in items)
   {
     p.Controls.Add(new LiteralControl(""&lt;li&gt;""));
     LinkButton lb = new LinkButton();
     lb.Text = FormatReportNames(r.Name);
     lb.ToolTip = GenerateReportDescription(r);
     lb.CommandArgument = r.Path; //path on ssrs server /&lt;servername&gt;/folder/reportname
     lb.Click += new EventHandler(ReportLink_Click);
     p.Controls.Add(lb);
     p.Controls.Add(new LiteralControl(""&lt;/li&gt;""));
   }
     p.Controls.Add(new LiteralControl(""&lt;/ul&gt;""));
}

void ReportLink_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  LinkButton rpt = (LinkButton)sender;
  MyReportViewer.LocalReport.ReportPath = rpt.CommandArgument + "".rdl"";
   ReportViewPanel.Update();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Currently when I run this the control does not render or display anything on the page.</p>

<p>I know I need to use ServerReport instead of LocalReport but what I am unclear on is what all needs to be a part of the method to retrieve and render the report. Is the datasource part of the rdl definition or do I need to reference/load that as well? (No I did not create the reports I have just been tasked with loading them). The SSRS server is on a different server than the web client, is there anything I need to consider for this? And finally each report has parameters do I have to pass these in or can the user be prompted?</p>

<p>When loading a report via code is the action to collect all the parameters first (login, report params, datasource) and then pass it to the report as an object that returns to the viewer a report with results. Or can it be parital where the report is loaded (blank) and then the user interacts with it similar as to if the user clicked on the report title from the report management page?</p>

<p>I would really appreciate any suggestions or references
Thanks in advance

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong></p>

<p>I expanded the analyzer results and followed what was happening. It was because I was using iRef in a method like so: [self doSomethingFancy:iRef]; and in that method, iRef was being retained but not released. So that fixes the warning, but I'm still a bit puzzled.</p>

<p>I am not quite clear on when to use the various __bridge casts. Under ARC, does the following increase the reference count?</p>

<pre><code>CGImageRef iRef = (__bridge CGImageRef)array[0];

<p>Also, at some point if I tell my _array iVar to removeAllObjects, will that decrement their reference counts properly? </p>

I believe it has been answered in all of the comments, but in the event there is such an option, I think it's best to clean up the question for future readers.</p>

<p>I recently inherited someone's Perl code and there's an interesting setup and I'm wondering if it can be made more efficient.  </p>

<p>The program is setup to use <code>strict</code> and <code>warnings</code> (as it should).  The program is setup to use <code>global</code> variables; meaning the variables are declared and initialized to <code>undef</code> at the top of the program.  Specific values beyond the initial <code>undef</code> are then assigned to the variables throughout various loops within the program.  After they are set, there is a separate report section (after all internal loops and subroutines have run) that uses the variables for its content.  </p>

<p>There are quite a few variables and it seems repetitive to just make an initial variable declaration at the top of the program so that it is available later for output/report purposes (and to stay compliant with the strict pragma).  Based on my understanding and from all of the comments received thus far, it seems this is the only way to do it, as lexically scoped variables by definition only persist in during their declared scope. So, in order to make it <code>global</code> it needs to be declared early (i.e. at the top).</p>

<p>I'm just wondering if there is a shortcut to elevate the scope of a variable to be global regardless of where it's declared, and still stay within <code>strict's</code> parameters of course?  </p>

<p>My previous example was confusing, so I'll write a pseudo code example here to convey the concept (I don't have the original source with me):</p>

<pre><code># Initial declaration to create ""Global variables"" -- imagine about 30 or so
my ($var1, $var2, $var3); # Global

# Imagine a foreach loop going through a hash and assigning values 
# to previously declared variables
for my $k (keys %h){
  ...
  $var = 1; #$var gets set to 1 within the foreach loop
  ...
}
print ""The final calculated report is as follows:\n"";

#output $var after loop is done later in program
print ""Variable 1 comes to $var1\n""; 
</code></pre>

<p>So the question: is there an acceptable shortcut that declares <code>$var1</code> within the <code>foreach</code> loop above and escalates its scope beyond the <code>foreach</code> loop, so it is in effect ""Global""? This would avoid the need to declare and initialize it to <code>undef</code> at the top of the program and still make it available for use in the program's output.</p>

<p>Based on feedback already received the answer seems to be an emphatic ""No"" due to the defined scoping constraints.</p>

<p>You will notice that the above script <strong>has support of Accept ranges so a user can seek into the movie</strong>! <strong>That feature works perfectly as well as the movie itself</strong>. I can see the movie from my player by accessing that file without any problems at all.</p>

<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>

<p>The problem is in the shutdown function. You may ask why i want to use posix_kill and kill the php pid.</p>

<p>User has the option to select multiple movies to see from my application. A user has LIMIT to connections that can be opened to my server. That means if a user has 1 available slots to connect to the server he will be able to open only one movie at once.</p>

<p>For that reason, let's say that a user is currently watching a Movie and he wants to ZAP (change) the current movie to another one. </p>

<p>He won't be able to do that, because the old connection will not be ended fast and the pid will remain open for some seconds more.</p>

<h2>POSIX_KILL Explanation</h2>

<p><strong>If we uncomment the //posix_kill line</strong> of the above code the user <strong>won't be able to see any movie</strong> at all because somehow the posix_kill function override all the above headers and the nginx/php does not send the headers i have in the file.</p>

<p><strong>However, if i DISABLE the HTTP SEEK and enable the posix_kill as explained, user will be able to watch movies BUT he wont be able to seek</strong> . This is happening because when we have the Accept-Ranges header, players are doing multiple requests to the movie before opening it.</p>

<p>So for example, a player will do 2-3 requests to that PHP File to understand and identify the seek. Posix_kill however will kill those pids fast, and the player wont be able to take the right headers.</p>

<h2>What we want</h2>

<p>So, we want a solution that will make the PID of the connection in the server to be dropped instantly when the user closes the connection but remain the seek support.</p>

<p><em>PS. The above code with posix_kill enabled works PERFECTLY on live streaming as we don't have seek so a player will only make one request.</em></p>

<p>Hope you understand me

<p>I recently got a new computer (Windows 7 64 bit) and freshly installed Visual Studio 2010 Shell and F# 2.0 and am having the same exact issue. Note: I just checked the About page and it says the only installed component is Visual Web Developer 2010 (seemed odd to me).</p>

There are (2), one that states the captured amount and then one stating IPN Completed. In short, I would like to hide these from Comments History. </p>

<p>Main reason: I included a Comments box for the customer when placing an order. The only issue is the Comment they enter is the first comment, so the Paypal Notifications override and the Customer Comment is not listed in the Order Grid (I added a column to include Comments on Sales Order Grid). </p>

<p>Basically, I want only Customer and Admin Comments to be included in the Comments History. </p>

<p>I could possibly accomplish this by changing the Comments from descending order to ascending order, but I would rather not do that because it defeats the purpose. Plus it would still probably select the most recent comment by the date/time regardless of the order.</p>

<p>I suppose I could turn off IPN since we only place orders using ""Sale"" instead of Authorization, but that defeats the purpose as well.</p>

<p>I was able to accomplish this with an extension I am using a while back which displayed all of the box sizes for the order in the comments. (huge pain because if they order a bunch of items, it would list each box, making the Sales Order Grid REALLY long!) But, unfortunately, I do not work with Magento everyday so I forgot how I did it. </p>

<p>I am working with Magento 1.8.1.0 currently. I have a custom theme from EMthemes.</p>

<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I've looked at using UIView's setAnimationDidStopSelector:, however from the docs this looks like it only applies when used within a UIView animation block (beginAnimations and commitAnimations). I also gave it a try just in case, but it doesn't seem to work.</p>

<p>Here's some sample code (this is within a custom UIView sub-class method):</p>

<pre><code>// These have no effect since they're not in a UIView Animation Block
[UIView setAnimationDelegate:self];
[UIView setAnimationDidStopSelector:@selector(animationDidStop:finished:context:)];    

// Set up path movement
CAKeyframeAnimation *pathAnimation = [CAKeyframeAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@""path""];
pathAnimation.calculationMode = kCAAnimationPaced;
pathAnimation.fillMode = kCAFillModeForwards;
pathAnimation.removedOnCompletion = NO;
pathAnimation.duration = 1.0f;

CGMutablePathRef path = CGPathCreateMutable();
CGPathMoveToPoint(path, NULL, self.center.x, self.center.y);

// add all points to the path
for (NSValue* value in myPoints) {
    CGPoint nextPoint = [value CGPointValue];
    CGPathAddLineToPoint(path, NULL, nextPoint.x, nextPoint.y);
}

pathAnimation.path = path;
CGPathRelease(path);

[self.layer addAnimation:pathAnimation forKey:@""pathAnimation""];
</code></pre>

<p>A workaround I was considering that should work, but doesn't seem like the best way, is to use NSObject's performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:. As long as I set the delay equal to the duration of the animation, then it should be fine.</p>

<p>Is there a better way? Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks, I see what you mean, but my HttpModule is checking the type of request before inserting anything into the cache, so it will only occur on form uploads.</p>

<p>I've tried what you suggested anyway, and the breakpoint never gets hit when I am refreshing the page that displays the cached value. </p>

The only major modifications I made to the code were variable name changes and using gl_Vertex and gl_Normal instead of attributes.</p>

<p><strong>vertex program snippet</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>varying vec3 pos_eye;
varying vec3 n_eye;

pos_eye = vec3(ViewMatrix * ModelMatrix * gl_Vertex);
n_eye = vec3(ViewMatrix * ModelMatrix * vec4(gl_Normal, 0.0));
gl_Position = ProjectionMatrix * ViewMatrix * ModelMatrix * gl_Vertex;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>fragment program snippet</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>vec3 incident_eye = normalize(pos_eye);
vec3 norm = normalize(n_eye);
vec3 reflected = reflect(incident_eye, norm);
reflected = vec3(InverseViewMatrix * vec4(reflected, 0.0));
vec3 cubemapColor = textureCube(cubemap, reflected).rgb;
</code></pre>

<p>When I load in a model then insert a camera, the cube map actually starts out inverted, but once I move the camera away at a certain distance, I get the proper results. Has anyone seen this problem before when implementing cube maps? I'm thinking this is an issue with Motion and/or FxPlug with how it handles the cameras.</p>

<p>A video of the problem in action can be found at <a href=""http://youtu.be/Yj85y-VKjCY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/Yj85y-VKjCY</a></p>

<p>In the video, I load up a basic sphere, scale it up, and enable the skybox. The cubemap on the sphere starts upside-down. When I rotate the sphere, the cube map doesn't even move (Disregard the black texturing artifacts throughout the video when the camera moves; that seems to happen when there's insufficient memory or something). After zooming into the sphere, I get a more realistic ""reflection"" distortion, but the cube map is still upside-down. 
It isn't until I start zooming out into a reasonable distance that the cube map transforms into how it's supposed to look. What I did notice is that the cube map looks correct when the white rectangle that surrounds the sphere is fully visible.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any advice on how to solve this problem. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>END EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I'm using <code>rails 3.2.13</code> and <code>cocoon</code> to make a nested form in my student_group model.  The formatting is a still a bit screwy, and i'd like to implement coffeescript to auto update the correct number of students, but these are things i can figure out later.  For now, the main problem is that while the forms show up and can be filled in/submitted without errors, new children models are not being created.  </p>

<p>here's the <code>_form</code> partial</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= form_for @student_group do |f| %&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    The name of this group is 
    &lt;span class=""field form_field""&gt;&lt;%= f.text_field :name %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    and it is a/an 
    &lt;span class=""field dropdown""&gt;&lt;%= f.select :type_of_group, [[""select a group type"", """"], ""young learners class (0-6)"", ""primary class (7-12)"", ""secondary class (13-17)"", ""adult class (18+)"", ""children's sport team"", ""adult's sport team""]  %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;!--  &lt;span id=""nos"" class=""field dropdown""&gt;&lt;%#= f.select :number_of_students, (0..60) %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  --&gt; 
  &lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;table id=""nos_header""&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Student name:&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Gender:&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;    
    &lt;%= f.fields_for :students do |builder| %&gt;
      &lt;%= render ""student_fields"", :f =&gt; builder %&gt;
    &lt;% end %&gt;
    &lt;td class=""links""&gt;&lt;%= link_to_add_association 'add student', f, :students %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;%= f.submit ""Submit"", :class =&gt; 'big_button round unselectable'%&gt;

&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the <code>_student_fields</code> partial:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr class=""nested-fields""&gt;
  &lt;td class=""field form_field""&gt;&lt;%= f.text_field :name %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=""field dropdown""&gt;&lt;%= f.select :gender, [[""select a gender"", """"],'Female', 'Male', 'Transgender'] %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to_remove_association ""remove student"", f %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I make a new group in the browser, the new students are not created and I can see this in the server:</p>

<p>this is not the whole part of the recursion, I have also if statements which will mark my route so that we cannot move through points we have allready visisted. I also have an if statement that prevents us from moving outside of the matrix.</p>

<p>Any hints on how to modify this code to finding all possible paths?</p>

<p>My task is to save and print the shortest path at the end of the program. Each point in the matrix has different values which takes different amount of time to move through, in the end you will have accumulated time traveling through the matrix (But this is irrelevant to my question I think, this I know perfectly how to code) I just need hints on how to create an algorimth which will <strong>test</strong> ALL possible paths from one point to another.</p>

<p>The RedisCloud <a href=""http://redis-cloud.com/redis/developers/redis-redis-windows"" rel=""nofollow"">.net client documentation</a> states to <strong>not</strong> use the <a href=""https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis"" rel=""nofollow"">ServiceStack.Redis</a> connection managers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: the ServiceStack.Redis client connection managers (BasicRedisClientManager and PooledRedisClientManager) should be disabled when working with the Garantia Data Redis Cloud. Use the single DNS provided upon DB creation to access your Redis DB. The Garantia Data Redis Cloud distributes your dataset across multiple shards and efficiently balances the load between these shards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would they suggest that? Because they are doing fancy load balancing stuff in their 'Garantia Data' layer and don't want to handle unnecessary connections? The <code>RedisClient</code> class is not thread-safe, so it makes it much more difficult from the application programming perspective.</p>

<p>Should I just ignore their instructions and use a <code>PooledRedisClientManager</code>? How would I configure it with the single uri that RedisCloud provides?</p>

<p>Or will I need to write a basic <code>RedisClient</code> pool wrapper that just creates new <code>RedisClient</code> connections as needed to handle concurrent access (i.e. ignores all read/write pooling specifics, hopefully delegating all that up-stream to the RedisCloud layer)?</p>

<p><strong>Preface:</strong></p>

<p>I've been doing a lot of research on Entity Framework recently and something that keeps bothering me is its performance when the queries are not warmed-up, so called cold queries. </p>

<p>I went through the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/hh949853.aspx"">performance considerations</a> article for Entity Framework 5.0. The authors introduced the concept of <strong>Warm</strong> and <strong>Cold</strong> queries and how they differ, which I also noticed myself without knowing of their existence. Here it's probably worth to mention I only have six month of experience behind my back.</p>

<p>Now I know what topics I can research into additionally if I want to understand the framework better in terms of performance. Unfortunately most of the information on the Internet is outdated or bloated with subjectivity, hence my inability to find any additional information on the <em>Warm</em> vs <em>Cold</em> queries topic.</p>

<p>Basically what I've noticed so far is that whenever I have to recompile or the recycling hits in, my initial queries are getting very slow. Any subsequent data read is fast (<em>subjective</em>), as expected.</p>

<p>We'll be migrating to Windows Server 2012, IIS8 and SQL Server 2012 and as a Junior I actually won myself the opportunity to test them before the rest. I'm very happy they introduced a warming-up module that will get my application ready for that first request. However, I'm not sure how to proceed with warming up my Entity Framework.</p>

<p>What I already know is worth doing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generate my Views in advance as suggested.</li>
<li>Eventually move my models into a separate assembly.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I consider doing, by going with common sense, <strong>probably wrong approach</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Doing dummy data reads at Application Start in order to warm things
up, generate and validate the models.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>What would be the best approach to have high availability on my Entity Framework at anytime?</li>
<li>In what cases does the Entity Framework gets ""cold"" again? (Recompilation, Recycling, IIS Restart etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p><code>map.login '/login', :controller =&gt; 'sessions', :action =&gt; 'new', :conditions =&gt; {:method =&gt; :get}</code></p>

<p>But of the following two routing specs, the first passes, but the second fails:</p>

<pre><code>specify 'session' do
  # passes:
  {:get =&gt; '/session/new'}.should route_to(:controller =&gt; 'sessions', :action =&gt; 'new')

specify 'session via login alias' do
  # fails:

<p>The failure is ""The generated path &lt;""/session/new""> did not match &lt;""/login"">"".</p>

<p>I thought the point of routing specs was to verify that when a route (HTTP method + URI) is provided, we can validate which controller action is called and what <code>params</code> are parsed.  The <code>login</code> route works in practice.  What am I misunderstanding about routing specs?</p>

Heres the code for presenting the view with the video/image:</p>

<pre><code>func playVideo() {
    // get path and url of movie
    let path = NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource(""static2"", ofType:""mov"")
    println(path)
    let url = NSURL.fileURLWithPath(path!)
    var moviePlayer = MPViewController()//took out video handling right now so this is just basically a regular view controller
    moviePlayer.navController = self.navigationController
    // construct the views
    moviePlayer.addGestRecognizer()

    self.navigationController.pushViewController(moviePlayer, animated: true)
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then I have this gesture recognizer added to the view cell:</p>

<pre><code>let singleTap = UILongPressGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: Selector(""tapped:""))
self.addGestureRecognizer(singleTap)
</code></pre>

<p>and here is the ""tapped:"" function:</p>

<pre><code>func tapped(gestureRecognizer:UIGestureRecognizer){
    println(""held down"")
    if gestureRecognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerState.Began {
        playVideo()
    }
    if gestureRecognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerState.Ended {
        println(""hold ended"")
        self.navigationController.popViewControllerAnimated(true)
    }
    //playVideo()
}
</code></pre>

<p>for some reason once I push the view controller onto the main navigationController I no longer get the ""hold ended"".  How can I set this up so it works exactly like snapchat?</p>

<p>then to turn it into a production server I then did this:</p>

<p>(the above works well to serve my node.js app)</p>

<p>But what I am wondering is how can I install and configure nginx to work with installing codiad so that i can access the node.js apps that i create on the same server, instead of using vim or nano...</p>

<p>Another question is that if i cannot install codiad, is there a way that i can use chrome dev editor to git push (i know that this can be done), to the node.js apps, I did follow alot of articles explaining how to do this, and i was able to set things up but it was like giving permission errors, could not make head or tales of it even if i did change permissions...</p>

<p>So i was wondering if anyone has configured Node.js and nginx and git push and clone to work all together, and maybe to install codiad on the same server to make coding easier?</p>

<p>Hope some can help me..:)</p>

There is manageNrc.js, which has entry in index.html ,on load of  which(managenrc.js) it creates the components managenrcgrid .js(EXt gridpanel) and managenrcform.js(Ext form panel).So far so good.But when the user toggles the radio button right on the top of the page.application takes  him to the login page.This time it is expected to reload the components and show all fieldlabels of the components in the french language user selected. I implemented localisation with two arrays in a json file nrclabels.json.</p>

As I am using it on mobile, I would like the tooltip to show on click/touch instead of on hover. Is there a way to do it?</p>

<pre><code>$.jqplot.eventListenerHooks.push(['jqplotMouseMove', handleMove]);

<p>on the beginning of jqplot.highlighter.js to</p>

<pre><code>$.jqplot.eventListenerHooks.push(['jqplotDataClick', handleMove]);

<p>but with no sucess. Maybe I'm understanding the whole thing wrong?</p>

<p>(in the meanwhile, I found the solution: if you are using modernizr, replace the line above with:</p>

<pre><code>var monitorTouch;

if($('html').hasClass('touch')) {
    monitorTouch = 'jqplotClick';
} else {
    monitorTouch = 'jqplotMouseMove';
}

$.jqplot.eventListenerHooks.push([monitorTouch, handleMove]);

<p>This way, if your mobile device has touch enabled, the tooltip will activate on click; else, it will activate on mouseover.</p>

<p>and I want it to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>08/02/2012

<p>And am having trouble figuring out exactly how to do that.  All of the data is in the same Column, if that helps.  </p>

<p>Clarification: The CSV file I'm modifying has many fields, several of which regard dates, hwoever, this is the only column with the time also included.  I need to fix the entire column so it drops the time off of it, with out changing the date, and also with out affecting the other dates in each line.<br>
So it looks more like this:</p>

<p>(on a side note, what I really wish I could do is fix the ridiculously broken program that gives us these reports which aren't formatted correctly to begin with, but THE MAN won't let us do that :/ )</p>

<p>Edit in response to comments:
The time is consistent.  It is always MM/DD/YYYY space HH:MM a/p. so, essentially, i could jsut remove the last 7 characters from the field and it would give the desired result.</p>

<p>Simply put: I want to 'suspend' the event listener. Can this be done? The MooTools docs only go into adding, removing, cloning and propagation of events. Not 'ignoring' them for a while.</p>

<p>I understand the solution for this can lie elsewhere:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hide the button with some css, e.g. <code>$('button').setStyle('visibility', 'hidden')</code> and let it show up again later</li>
<li>Some overlay, again hiding the original element, and showing a substitute (grayed out button for instance)</li>
<li>Cloning the element, removing all the events from the original (making the button 'unavailable'), then replace the original with the clone (thus making it available again)</li>
<li>Let the function attached to the event listener check if the button is available or not</li>
</ol>

<p>However, this is a bit beside the point and seems more elaborate then necessary. My question is if and how I can control the event listener, basically: can I suspend it?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I guess the answer is 'no'. This means doing one of the four things mentioned above, or as mentioned in the answer I accepted: disable the button HTML-element, thus suspending the response to event listeners.</p>

<p>Based on the 'Bad Input Exception', I am pretty sure that is a problem with the start_node and end_node arguments. Basically, I want to refer to the previous get_or_create nodes and relationships. How do you refer to these in the batch?</p>

<p>UPDATE: after much experimentation, I have narrowed in on a possible method to reproduce this error - if either of the nodes in the get_or_create already exist in the graph, the batch operation fails with a bad input error on the index corresponding to the existing node. I have also updated the code to show exactly what I ran. Running this code for the first time succeeds (with both nodes NOT present in the graph). Running it again fails.</p>

<p>Let's talk code for a second. I have the following markup, where <code>injected-via-js</code> is injected via javascript into a large form (progressive enhancement).</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form class=""dotNET-form-wrapper""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""injected-via-js""&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;&amp;pound;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;!-- More form elements --&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>On most mobile browsers, when you change the value in the number input and press <code>Go</code> or <code>Enter</code> it fakes the button press (which in my case has an important event bound to it). However on some old Android devices pressing <code>Go</code> will submit the form instead, which is <strong>not</strong> what I want. To clarify: <strong>I want the <code>Go</code> button to fake the button press, not submit the form</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
.NET is only relevant to this question due to the fact that <strong>everything</strong> is wrapped in a form, meaning I cannot create a separate form around the input and button and highjack the new form's submit.</p>

<p>I've made a JSBin where I was able to replicate this bug with an <code>Android 2.2</code> phone although I imagine it exists on other bad browsers as well. It works as expected on <code>iOS 6+</code> and <code>Android 2.3+</code>.</p>

However I am not able to relate ring0 with either system mode or supervisor mode. Depending on the source of information, it seems that both modes can very well do the job of running a kernel in privileged mode.
The only differences between the two modes that I could find out are the follwoing:</p>

<p>well we need to  put cache on it, so we can speed up things and im really confuse on how to make cache id, sence the query is kind of dynamic (depending on array value), which can also have search value too, which changes the result also, time to time, depend on what you are searching for.</p>

<p>my question is, is there anyway i can use the return query (select * from... .. ..) and make and id of it, maybe using md5 or some other way, which stay same if query is same and changes if query is different?</p>

So I'm going to give you what I have coded and have tried first and then describe my problem and what it's suppose to do last.</p>

<p>So I have a select div with some stuff in it.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""month"" onchange=""refreshGraph()""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And when an option is chosen this javascript is suppose to work.</p>

<pre><code>function refreshGraph()
{
            var index = document.getElementById('month').selectedIndex;
            var monthOptions = document.getElementById('month').options;
            var selectedDays = monthOptions[index].value;

            $.ajax({
                    url:""divisions.php"",
                    type: ""POST"",
                    dataType: ""script"",
                    data: {days:selectedDays},
                    success: function(data){
                            $('#divisions').html(data);}
                    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried rewriting the success function call to be like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#divisions').html('&lt;script src=""http://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js""&gt;
    &lt;script src=""http://code.highcharts.com/modules/exporting.js""&gt;'+data+'&lt;\/script&lt;\/script&gt;')
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of the $.ajax() I've also tried this</p>

<pre><code>$('#divisions').load(""divisions"", {days: selectedDays});
</code></pre>

<p>This is suppose to update a table with a div with id of divisions.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;div id=""divisions"" style=""min-width: 90%; height: 50%; margin: 0 auto""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now divisions.php is a file that has some database calls and a javascript highchart written in plain text meaning there's no php or script or anything else like that surrounding the plain text javascript code that is the highchart. So after all my php it begins like this</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {
    $('#divisions').highcharts({
        chart: {
</code></pre>

<p>Here are my source files I'm including in the header of index_new.php:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=""http://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=""http://code.highcharts.com/modules/exporting.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=""divisions.php""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So what am I trying to do? I'm trying to update the chart given the choice someone chooses in the dropdown. The values in the dropdown are additional sql parameters that get passed to <code>divisions.php</code>. <code>divisions.php</code> then uses this additional sql parameter in its calling which affects what the table looks like.</p>

<p>On first loading of <code>index_new.php</code> highchart gets loaded and everything is fine. The problem I'm facing is when I choose any of the options in the dropdown the chart updates BUT instead of showing a highchart it shows the plain text javascript (see below) that was previously interpreted as actual javascript when index_new.php was first called. So the ajax call is working and I'm grabbing the variable correctly but I'm guessing it's the javascript I have in my header that's not styling it? I have no clue why this isn't working.</p>

<p>Instead of a highchart I get this when updated (Yes I did replace the actual names with name1, name2,...etc):</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () { $('#divisions').highcharts({ chart: { type: 'column' }, title: { text: 'Total Sales By Salesperson' }, xAxis: { title: { text: 'Salesperson'}, categories: ['name1', 'name2', 'name3', 'name4', 'name5', 'name6', 'name7', ] }, yAxis: { min: 0, title: { text: 'Total Sales' } }, tooltip: { formatter: function() { return ''+ this.x +'
'+ this.series.name +': '+ this.y +'
'+ 'Total: '+ this.point.stackTotal; } }, legend: { backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF', reversed: true }, plotOptions: { }, series:[ {name: 'Business Equipment' , data: [0, 400, 80000, 68496, 15800, 170000, 155200, ]},{name: 'Corporate Printing' , data: [0, 0, 0, 6600, 0, 0, 0, ]},{name: 'Document Storage' , data: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 18000, 0, ]},{name: 'IT Services' , data: [10000, 0, 0, 4500, 0, 0, 2000, ]},]});})

The job itself is simple:</p>

<p>Which runs fine when I run that in the Spark Master node of my EC2 cluster.
I'm trying to running this in a remote Windows client.

    conf.set(""spark.driver.port"", ""15000"");

<p>I've no idea what that's about, my guess is that probably worker node could not connect to driver, which probably initially set as:</p>

<p>Obviously, no DNS is going to resolve my host name...</p>

<p>Since I can't set deploy mode to <code>""client""</code> or <code>""cluster""</code>, if not via <code>./spark-submit</code> script.(Which I think that's absurd...). I try to add a host resolution <code>""XX.XXX.XXX.XX [host-name]""</code> in <code>/etc/hosts</code> of all Spark Master Worker nodes.</p>

<p>No luck of course...
That leads me to the second, un-comment that two line;</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>http://myapp/page-subpage-id.htm
http://myapp/page-subpage.htm

<p>To the following:</p>

http://myapp/?page=page&amp;sub=subpage
http://myapp/?page=page

<h3>Initial Solution</h3>

<p>I have this content in my <code>.htaccess</code> file:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^([^-]*)-([^-]*)-([^-]*)\.htm$ ./?page=$1&amp;sub=$2&amp;id=$3&amp;%{QUERY_STRING} [L]
RewriteRule ^([^-]*)-([^-]*)\.htm$ ./?page=$1&amp;sub=$2&amp;%{QUERY_STRING} [L]
RewriteRule ^([^/]*)\.htm$ ./?page=$1&amp;%{QUERY_STRING} [L]
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ ./index.php?page=404&amp;url=$1&amp;%{QUERY_STRING}
</code></pre>

<p>It works perfect. But now my requirement changed to something like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>http://myapp/page-subpage-id.htm
http://myapp/page-subpage.htm
http://myapp/page.htm
http://myapp/page-subpage-id
http://myapp/page-subpage
http://myapp/page
</code></pre>

<p>Should redirect to:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>http://myapp/?page=page&amp;sub=subpage&amp;id=id
http://myapp/?page=page&amp;sub=subpage
http://myapp/?page=page

"24728323","1","24728393","","2014-07-14 01:05:04","","0","83","<p><strong>RESOLVED</strong>: The segfault was caused by infinite (well, not <em>actually</em> infinite) recursion. The infinite recursion took place in my <code>uint pow(uint a, uint b)</code> function and its helper function when I forgot to account for the case <code>b = 0</code>. When <code>b = 0</code>, <code>b</code> will decrease, wrapping it around to the <code>unsigned int</code> limit, and then keep adding stacks until <code>b</code> gets back to 1.</p>

<p>Thank you @chris for helping with debugging, and @vsoftco for suggesting infinite recursion.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm pretty new to C++. I'm writing a program that has 4 functions and 3 of them are recursive (I suspect the recursive functions pertain to this issue).</p>

<p>Essentially, I know that I run into a segfault when I get to the following line of code:</p>

<pre><code>    uint right = (n % pow(10, i)) / pow(10, i - 1);
</code></pre>

<p>This code is inside the for loop of my <code>bool isPalindrome(uint)</code> function. This the only information I have pertaining to the segfault.</p>

<p>I have tried looking for segfault examples on stackoverflow and google, but I can't find any that <em>don't</em> pertain to pointers and stuff like that.</p>

<p>What is going wrong here? Any and all help will be greatly appreciated. Also, please explain any suggestions you make as I am fairly new to C++ and intend to learn as much as I can. The entire source code follows, which I assume is invaluable to this problem.</p>

<p>We’re running our websocket server via SSL on port 443. We’ve specified the location of our WebsocketMainInsecure.swf file (these are cross-domain ws requests) in the correct location, and we’re loading the file in the swfobject embed over HTTPS.</p>

<p>We opened up port 843 in our security group for our EC2 instance and the cross origin policy file is successfully being rendered over HTTP. It does not seem to render over HTTPS (Chrome throws an SSL connection error).</p>

<p>We’ve tried two versions of the WebsocketMainInsecure.swf file. The first is the file provided by Socket.io, which is built off of WebsocketMainInsecure.as that does not include the line</p>

<pre><code>Security.allowInsecureDomain(""*"");
</code></pre>

<p>This throws the error <code>SCRIPT16389: Unspecified error.</code> at the <code>WebSocket.__flash.setCallerUrl(location.href)</code> line.</p>

<p>We figured it was because the SWF file was not permitting HTTPS requests, so we replaced the WebSocketMainInsecure.swf file with the one found at this repo: <a href=""https://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js"">https://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js</a> because it includes the</p>

<pre><code>Security.allowInsecureDomain(""*"");
</code></pre>

<p>line in the actionscript code. When we used this, we saw that the flashsocket connection kept disconnecting and reconnecting in an infinite loop. We tracked the error down to the transport.js file in the socket.io library in the onSocketError function on the Transport prototype. It throws the error:</p>

<pre><code>[Error: 139662382290912:error:1408F092:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_RECORD:data length too long:s3_pkt.c:503:]
</code></pre>

<p>We even tried updating both socket.io and socket.io-client to version 0.9.6 and we still got the <code>Access is denied</code> error.</p>

<p>This error has been very difficult to debug, and now we’re at a loss as to how to get flashsockets to work. We’re wondering if it might have to do with using an older version of socket.io, or maybe that our policy file server doesn’t accept HTTPS requests, or maybe even the way in which the WebSocketMainInsecure.swf file from the web-socket-js github repo was built relative to what socket.io-client expects.</p>

"13063440","1","13063623","","2012-10-25 07:13:47","","0","57","<p>Unfortunately, all of my RDMS experience comes from using my company's proprietary database technology, and I'm struggling to find analogues that transfer my knowledge to PHP/MySQL practices.</p>

<p>In my company, we define ""data dictionary"" configurations that define tables, fields, keys, and such:</p>

<pre><code>orders_Dct.cfg
trades_Dct.cfg
profiles_Dct.cfg
</code></pre>

<p>One such configuration file might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>table
{
    name   ORDERS
    fields (ORDER_ID, ORDER_VS, PRICE, QUANTITY)

    key
    {
        name ORDERS_BY_ID_VS
        sort (ORDER_ID, ORDER_VS)
    }
}

field
{
    name ORDER_ID
    type CHARARRAY
    size 8
}

field
{
    name ORDER_VS
    type I32
}

field
{
    name PRICE
    type F64
}

field
{
    name QUANTITY
    type F64
}
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, we define ""static data"", e.g. <code>profiles_Static.cfg</code>:</p>

<pre><code>table
{
    name PROFILES

    entry
    {
        USER_ID    0
        USER_NAME  SYSTEM
        SUPER_USER Y
    }

    entry
    {
        USER_ID    1
        USER_NAME  TEST
        SUPER_USER N
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We then run commands such as <code>Install</code>, <code>Remap</code>, and <code>LoadStatic</code> to update the database based on these configuration files.</p>

<p>Now, I can write scripts of course, perhaps even replicating the way my company does things, but I think there must be some standard way to do this in PHP/MySQL. I wonder if I'm searching with the wrong terminology in mind, because based on terms like ""mysql"", ""database"", ""dictionary"", ""configuration"", and ""rollout"" I found only <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4692022/utility-to-create-data-dictionary-for-mysql-database"">this question about a utility to create a database dictionary</a>, which, at least on first glance, doesn't seem like what I'm looking for. <strong>I would like a simple, configuration-file-based approach to setting up database tables, fields, keys, and static data. Would someone point in me in the right direction?</strong></p>

<p><strong>If there is no such ""standard"" practice, then there must be a good reason, and I'm open to adapting to a different way of doing things.</strong> But it definitely seems silly to have to write a custom script for this purpose!</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

I've an user control that has a FormView for the insert operations and a GridView for all others.</p>

<p>In both controls I've a DropDownList as follow:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:DropDownList ID=""DropDownList"" runat=""server""
    DataSourceID=""ObjectDataSource"" 
    DataTextField=""Text""
    SelectedValue='&lt;%# Bind(""Code"") %&gt;'
    DataValueField=""Code""
    AppendDataBoundItems=""True"" Width=""200px"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The error in the subject comes if the DropDownList in the FormView is present, if I comment it the DropDownList in the GridView works perfectly! It binds in edit mode and updates the value with out any problem!</p>

<p>But they are the same and only the ID changes.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that I've also another page with the same controls it works...</p>

<p>Does someone has any idea?</p>

public void Method1_Bar1SuccessIsTrue()

<p>I have tried to make this work through several attempts including creating an argument for the lambda expression, creating an argument for the It.IsAny&lt;>() expression, creating delegates for the specified method under test.  However, every attempt either creates a compiler error or throws a runtime exception.</p>

<p>I can create the generic test if I do a setup in every test (as seen in the commented out .Setup lines).  However does anyone have an idea how I can move that setup line into the generic method?  I know its only one line, but it seem to me this should be possible.</p>

<p>I am using the <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore"" rel=""nofollow"">Dropbox Datastore API</a> to store information in my app. I am trying to figure out a reliable way to check if the user is authenticated with Dropbox. 
<br><br><br>Currently I am using this helper function:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean isLoggedIn(Context context){
    LogHelper logHelper = new LogHelper();
    DbxAccount dropboxAcount = getDropboxAccountManager(context).getLinkedAccount();

    if(dropboxAcount == null){
        return false;
    } else{
        if(dropboxAcount.isLinked() &amp;&amp; dropboxAcount.getAccountInfo() != null){
            return true;
        } else{
            return false;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><br><br>
The problem with this is if a user becomes unauthenticated after they have logged in, for example, if the user goes to their dropbox settings and unlinks the app. When this happens the above function will detect that the user is logged in, only when you try to perform an action that requires authentication(Like writing to a datastore) does the dropbox api realize that the user is not authenticated.

The bucket can either be a new one (one that has never been used before, of which there are an infinite supply) or it can be an existing bucket. If I look at the number of buckets with one item, the number with two, the number with three, etc., I want those bucket counts to follow an exponential distribution. I hope I'm saying that correctly -- if 80% of the buckets have 1 item, then 16% should have two, 3.2% should have three, etc. In general, the number of buckets of size k should be 1/p as many as the number of buckets of size k-1, and the fraction of buckets that are size 1 should be (1-p) to make the math work out right.</p>

<p>If I knew the number of items in advance, it would be easy: I'd know how many buckets of each size, so I can just pile the the items into as many buckets of each size as I needed. Or if I were just generating bucket sizes, it'd be easy even if I didn't know the total in advance: each new bucket has probability (1-p) of being size 1, (1-p)p of being size 2, (1-p)p^2 size 3, (1-p)p^3 size 4, etc.</p>

<p>But I am processing <em>items</em>, so as I get an item in, I need to choose a bucket: either an existing one, or a new one. If I make a new bucket, then I get one more of size 1. But if I choose an existing one of size k, then I get one more bucket of size k+1, and one <strong>fewer</strong> of size k. So what should the probability of choosing a bucket of size k be (where k can be zero to indicate making a new bucket)? And how does it relate to p?</p>

<p>I am doing this to generate test data where I only know the mean number of items per bucket (1.5, it turns out), don't know the number of items in advance, and think that the exponential distribution of bucket sizes is realistic for my situation. I'm probably making it more complicated than it needs to be, but I was surprised because I thought it would be easy.</p>

<p>And maybe it is, but I'm just missing something. (And I can't figure out how to Google it, either.)</p>

<p>I was given a list of about 250k entries along with names and sign in dates to accompany each entry to show when they logged. My task is to find out which users signed in on consecutive days, how often and how many times. </p>

<p>i.e. Bob smith had 3 consecutive days one time, 5 consecutive days 3 times.
     joe smith had 8 consecutive days once, 5 consecutive days 8 times
etc</p>

<p>I am brand new to VBA and have been struggling to write a program to do this. 
code:</p>

<pre><code>Option Explicit

Option Base 1

Sub CountUUIDLoop()

    Dim UUID As String
    Dim Day As Date
    Dim Instance() As Variant
    ReDim Instance(50, 50)
    Dim CountUUID As Variant
    Dim q As Integer
    Dim i As Long
    Dim j As Long
    Dim f As Integer
    Dim g As Integer
    Dim LastRow As String
    f = 1
    q = 1
    g = 2

        LastRow = Cells.Find(""*"", [A1], , , xlByRows, xlPrevious).Row
        For i = q To LastRow
            UUID = Cells(i, ""A"")
            Instance(f, 1) = UUID

            g = 2
            For j = 1 To LastRow
                If UUID = Cells(j, ""A"") Then
                    Instance(f, g) = Cells(j, ""B"")
                    g = g + 1
                End If

            Next j
            f = f + 1
            q = g - 1
        Next i

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>The goal of this code is to go through the entries and store them in the array 'Instance' such that the 2D array would look like [UUID1, B1, B2, B3]
                               [UUID2, B1, B2, B3, B4]
                               [UUID3, B1, B2]</p>

<p>Where the UUID is the user, the B1 represents the date that user signed in, b2 would be the next date they signed in etc. Some users have more or less dates than others. </p>

<p>My main issue has come with setting up the array as I keep getting different errors around it. I'm not sure how to define this 2D array partly because there will be over 30 000 rows, each with 1->85 columns. </p>

<p>Any help is appreciated, let me know if anything needs further clarification. Once again this is my first time using VBA so im sorry ahead of time if everything i've been doing is wrong.</p>

<p>P.S. I used ReDim Instance (50,50) as a test to see if i could make it work by predefining but same errors occurred. Thanks again!</p>

<p>I've found a few links that utilize (and have that working) through the use of a ""Thumb"" control anchored to the lower-right.</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;from random import randint
&gt;&gt;&gt;a = [""The random number is: {0}"".format(randint(0,10))]
&gt;&gt;&gt;print a[0]
The random number is: 3
&gt;&gt;&gt;print a[0]
The random number is: 3
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously it's obtaining a random integer, formatting the string and saving it in the list when the list is first defined. Performance hit aside, I'd like to know if it is possible to override this behavior. </p>

<p>I know if I were to see this question I would respond with something like ""you're doing it wrong"" and would provide something similar to the below answer...  </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;a = [""The random number is: {0}""]
&gt;&gt;&gt;print a[0].format(randint(0,10))
</code></pre>

<p>But lets assume that's not a solution for this question. I'd really like for the formatting to be defined and take place in the list itself (if possible). </p>

<p>Another example: </p>

<pre><code>a = [""The some sweet string: {0}"".format(someFunction),
     ""Another {0} different string {1}"".format(someFunctionTwo, someFunctionThree)]
</code></pre>

<p>Where someFunction* provides a ""random"" result upon each call. </p>

<p>I know its a bit of a stretch and I may have to rely on the methods provided already ( thanks for your feedback ) but, I figured I'd give it a shot. </p>

With help from <code>@Oleg</code> I was able to get it to work like I thought it should.</p>

<p>In further testing however, I have identified undesired behavior in that <code>onSelectRow</code> event.  What I found was that if I have a grid with 3 rows in it, and I click on row 2 (which activates the buttons), then (without clicking on the row 2 buttons) click on row 3 (which deactivates row 2 buttons &amp; activates row 3 buttons), and change my mind again &amp; click row 1 or 2 (doesn't matter), and at <strong>THAT</strong> point then click the <code>""Re-Send""</code> (submit) button, what happens is that the selected row is then re-sent 3 separate times.  </p>

<p>Following are the timestamps from 4 rows that were written from 1 ""Re-Send"" click yesterday.</p>

<pre><code>2013-05-28 16:49:04.817

2013-05-28 16:49:04.467

<p>I put some logging in the page &amp; confirmed that it does call the POST 4 separate times, once for each click on a row in the grid.  </p>

    emptyrecords:  ""No records to view"",
    loadonce: true,

    },
</code></pre>

<p>Following is the <code>onSelectRow</code> event.</p>

<pre><code>onSelectRow:  function(id) {
    var tr = $(this).jqGrid(""getInd"",id,true);
    var gridRow = $(this).jqGrid(""getRowData"",id);
    var srow = $(this).jqGrid(""getGridParam"",""selrow"");
    // disable all resendMsg &amp; cancelMsg buttons in the grid
    $(this).find(""input[name=resendMsg]"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"");
    $(this).find(""input[name=cancelMsg]"").attr(""disabled"", ""disabled"");
    // now enable the buttons for the current row only
    $(tr).find(""input[name=resendMsg]"").removeAttr(""disabled"");
    $(tr).find(""input[name=cancelMsg]"").removeAttr(""disabled"");
    // disable dropdowns &amp; sendMsg submit button
    // catch the Cancel button click
    $(tr).find(""input[name=cancelMsg]"").click(function() {
        // disable all resendMsg &amp; cancelMsg buttons in the grid
        $(this).find(""input[name=resendMsg]"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"");
        $(this).find(""input[name=cancelMsg]"").attr(""disabled"", ""disabled"");
        // enable the dropdowns &amp; clear the selection, reload grid
        ReloadGrid();
        });
    // catch the Re-Send button click
    $(tr).find(""input[name=resendMsg]"").click(function() {
        ReSendMessage(gridRow.Destination, gridRow.MessageText);
        // disable all resendMsg &amp; cancelMsg buttons in the grid
        $(this).find(""input[name=resendMsg]"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"");
        $(this).find(""input[name=cancelMsg]"").attr(""disabled"", ""disabled"");
        // enable the dropdowns, clear the selection and exit
        $(""#myGrid"").jqGrid(""resetSelection"");
        });
    },
</code></pre>

<p>and the remainder of the jqGrid code:</p>

<pre><code>gridview: true,
xmlReader:  { 
    root: ""Rowsets"", 
            row: ""Row"",
    repeatitems: false,
    id: ""SendTime""
    },
loadComplete: function() { 
    // increase row height
    $(""td"","".jqgrow"").height(40);            // data grid rows
     // alternate background of every other row
    $(""tr.jqgrow:odd"").css({""background-color"": ""#DDDDDC"", ""background-image"": ""none""});
    $(""th.ui-th-column"").css(""font-weight"",""bold"");
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>It's like the onSelectRow event is accumulating the number of clicks &amp; then calling the click event's functions however many times a row was selected but a button wasn't clicked.  </p>

<p>I have tested though, that if I click on a row, and then click on either of the submit buttons, that it processes as expected (a ""<code>Re-Send</code>"" submits the row 1 time, and a ""<code>Cancel</code>"" clears the selection &amp; does nothing else).  </p>

<p>I don't know if it is possible, but can you prevent a subsequent <code>onSelectRow</code> from firing if a row's already selected?  Can you clear the previous selection (or reset it) to prevent the <code>onSelectRow</code> (and the click event for the button) from firing multiple times?  </p>

<p>I'd appreciate any thoughts, comments or suggestions as to how to fix this behavior.  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>  </p>

<p>Including the code for <code>beforeSelectRow</code> as noted in a response below.</p>

<pre><code>$(""#myGrid"").bind(""jqGridBeforeSelectRow"", function(e, id, eventOriginal) {
    var gsr = $(""#myGrid"").jqGrid(""getGridParam"",""selrow"");
    console.log("" ****  beforeSelectRow - (before if) lastSel = "" + lastSel + ""  id = "" + id + ""   gsr = "" + gsr);
    if (id &amp;&amp; id !== lastSel) {
        console.log(""id &amp;&amp; id !== lastSel"");
        console.log(""   id = "" + id +  ""    lastSel = "" + lastSel);
        };
    if (id !== lastSel) {
        if (lastSel == -1) {   // first time thru
            lastSel = id;
            console.log("" ****  beforeSelectRow - first time thru - new val = "" + lastSel + ""  gsr = "" + gsr);
            return true;
            }
          else {
            console.log("" ****  beforeSelectRow - lastSel - "" + lastSel + ""   &lt;&gt;  id = ""  +id + ""    gsr = "" + gsr);
            return false;
            }
        }
    else {
        console.log("" ****  beforeSelectRow - otherwise they matched -  lastSel  = "" + lastSel + ""     id = "" + id + ""  gsr = "" + gsr);
        return true;
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>After moving the <code>.click</code> event from the <code>onSelectRow</code> into the <code>loadComplete</code> (for the Cancel button as a test), I tried the above code both inside &amp; outside the code for the grid.  It performs the same either way.</p>

<p>The issue is that the <code>Cancel</code> button is supposed to reset the selection <code>$(""#myGrid"").resetSelection();</code> and reload the grid.  The code executes &amp; doesn't give an error, but the very next time <code>beforeSelectRow</code> fires (when the grid is reloaded), the id is still the same as it was when <code>beforeSelectRow</code> and <code>onSelectRow</code> fired when I clicked on the row, which means that I can never select a new row until the entire page is reloaded.  Only on page load is when <code>beforeSelectRow</code> doesn't fire.  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Following is the code for the Cancel button, which is now located inside the <code>loadComplete</code> event.  </p>

<pre><code>// catch the Cancel button click
$(this).find(""input[name=cancelMsg]"").click(function() {
    // disable all resendMsg &amp; cancelMsg buttons in the grid
    $(this).find(""input[name=resendMsg]"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"");
    $(this).find(""input[name=cancelMsg]"").attr(""disabled"", ""disabled"");
    // enable the dropdowns &amp; clear the selection, reload grid
    console.log(""ReloadGrid (inside Cancel function) "");
    lastSel = -1;
    $(""#myGrid"").trigger(""reloadGrid"");

<p>The problem I'm having is that I'm not entirely sure what the data I'm looking at represents. </p>

<p>Here is the screen I see after running my game for a couple of minutes,</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/xkJMn.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I can expand the call tree to see exactly what methods are using the most CPU time. I'm unsure if this data represents CPU usage for the entire duration the profiler was running or is it just at that point in time.</p>

<p>I've tried running the slider along the timeline to see what effect that has on the numbers and it doesn't seem to have any. So that leeds me to believe the data represents CPU usage for the duration the game was running.</p>

<p>If this is the case then is it possible to access CPU usage at a particular point in time. There are a few spikes along the time line, I would like to see exactly what was happening at that time to see if there are any improvements I can make.</p>

  <p>json: Unmarshal(nil *main.Animal)</p>

<p>This appears to be because <code>animals</code> is an uninitialized pointer. But the docs say (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unmarshal unmarshals the JSON into the value pointed at by the pointer. <strong>If the pointer is nil, Unmarshal allocates a new value for it to point to.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why does unmarshaling fail in the second example and show that obscure error?</p>

<p>(Also, is it ""unmarshalling"" or ""unmarshaling"" (one L)? The docs use both.)</p>

We want to modify the serialization based on the device, so that when accessed from mobile devices, the service should serialize only some important data members(not all) </p>

<p>We have 2 options here</p>

<ol>
<li>Create separate operation and data contracts for different types of
devices </li>
<li>Mess with the actual xml serialization and suppress creating
unnecessary elements based on the device</li>
</ol>

<p>We don't want to go with the first option since it introduces a lot of redundant code problems in the future</p>

<p>Small research showed that we need to use IXmlSerializable and override the readXML() and writeXML() methods. But at the same time, I have seen somewhere that DataContract and IXmlSerializable should not be used together</p>

<p>Any example to mess with actual serialization is greatly appreciated .</p>

<pre><code>[DataContract]
public class TokenMessage
{
    string tokenValue;
    string extraValue;
    [DataMember]
    public string Token
    {
        get { return tokenValue; }

    {
        get { return extraValue; }
        set { extraValue = value; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now when i access the service which returns a typical TokenMessage data contract, from a mobile device, i don't want the ""Extra"" data member to be serialized i.e. When I supply a different argument to the operation contract, it should be able to serialize some/all the data members(depending on the action) </p>

<p>PS: For now please ignore the device detection part. Lets assume we have an argument in the operation contract, which helps us identify the device</p>

"8364617","1","","","2011-12-03 01:02:44","","0","112","<p>I have a signup form that contains a user resource and a creditcard resource. This allows users to signup and add a creditcard all from the signup form. I am just using standard accepts_nested_attributes_for as displayed in <a href=""http://railscasts.com/episodes/196-nested-model-form-part-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railscasts.com/episodes/196-nested-model-form-part-1</a></p>

<p>It works fine except if I get an error in saving the creditcard resource then it renders new.html.erb (which is good) but the form_for in 'new' renders it as manupulating an existing record rather than a new one. So if I look at the source then I can see that the form now contains method=put and action=/Users/{ID}. I assume this is because it first saves the parent object and then saves the creditcard so when the credit card is failing to be saved then the user object has already been saved but wrapped in a transaction. The user however is not actually saved in the db so I dont quite understand why Rails thinks it is when it renders new.html.erb. If I look at my User db table then the ID column doesnt go up steadily but instead goes up in increments of 2-3 as users have gotten the signup form wrong before getting it right. Whats the best way around this problem?</p>

gcc 4.4.3 c89:</p>

<p>I am just working on the following code below:</p>

<p>I just have some questions about dereferencing the src pointer. Which is declared in the calling function as:</p>

<pre><code>char src[] = ""device_id"";
</code></pre>

<p>My confusion rests with dereferencing the src:</p>

<pre><code>for(i = 0; src[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    printf(""src %d: [ %s ]\n"", i,  &amp;src[i]);
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>src</code> has decayed into a pointer. So src will be pointing to the first element in the array, which will be the character d:</p>

<pre><code>src -&gt; ""device_id""
</code></pre>

<p>So when I do this <code>src[i]</code> I am dereferencing the value so it will return the character being currently pointing at. For this example when it gets to the nul it will break from the for loop.</p>

<pre><code>For example i = 0
</code></pre>

<p>For <code>&amp;src[i]</code> am I getting the address of the character instead of the character itself?
So where <code>src[i]</code> will dereference and return d, <code>&amp;src[i]</code> will return the address of d.</p>

<p>Because <code>*dest[]</code> is an array of char pointers it is expecting an address. So here I am assigning an address of the character to the array of pointers to char.</p>

<pre><code>dest[i] = &amp;src[i];
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a difference to doing either this in the printf function for %s in using either <code>&amp;src[i]</code> or <code>src[i]</code>:</p>

<pre><code>printf(""src %d: [ %s ]\n"", i,  &amp;src[i]);
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>printf(""src %d: [ %s ]\n"", i,  src[i]);
</code></pre>

<p>Source code:</p>

<pre><code>void inc_array(char *src, size_t size)
{
    /* Array of pointers */
    char *dest[size];
    size_t i = 0;

    memset(dest, 0, size * (sizeof char*));

    /* Display contents of src */
    for(i = 0; src[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        printf(""src %d: [ %s ]\n"", i,  &amp;src[i]);
    }

    /* copy contents to dest */
    for(i = 0; i &lt; 9; i++) {
        dest[i] = &amp;src[i];
    }

    /* Display the contest of dest */
    for(i = 0; *dest[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        printf(""dest %d: [ %s ]\n"", i, dest[i]);

I'm pretty sure there's an answer out there to my issue, but I have no idea how search for it with the correct wording. Anyways what I'm trying to do is: Here I have created a session variable</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
// Session started
session_start();


// Connecting to the database
$host = ""localhost"";
$username = ""username"";
$password = ""password"";
$db_name = ""potholio"";
$tbl_name = ""userTbl"";

$conn = mysql_connect( $host, $username, $password );
if (! $conn )
{
    die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
}

mysql_select_db( $db_name );

// Submitting query and retrieving result)
$myusername = $_GET['myusername'];
$mypassword = $_GET['mypassword'];

$sql = ""SELECT * FROM $tbl_name WHERE usrName='"". $myusername .""' and pwd='"". $mypassword .""'"";
$result = mysql_query( $sql );

// Checking results
$count = mysql_num_rows( $result );

// Directing user based on result
if ( $count == 1 )
{
</code></pre>

<p>Now down below is where I have actually set the session variable that I want to access later on.</p>

<pre><code>    $userID = mysql_fetch_assoc( $result );
    $_SESSION['user'] = $userID['msgID'];

    header('Location: http://potholio.csproject.org/map.html');
}
else
{
    echo ""&lt;script&gt;alert('Incorrect username or password');&lt;/script&gt;"";
    header('Location: http://potholio.csproject.org/');
}

// Close Database Connection
mysql_close();
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now what I'm trying to access that session variable that I have set in a different file called map.html using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
// Initiate session 
session_start();

// Store session data
echo $_SESSION['user'];

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is that when I echo to see whether it was being set, the echo actually doesn't return anything, so I'm not sure what's going one since I know the variable is getting set in the other file, which is login.php. Any help with this probably would be great. I'm a complete beginner with Sessions and Session variables.</p>

Except my component with the dimensions that I want to remain the same is for an image. When I have proper data, it displays a map; when I have improper data, it displays an image of the jolly roger flag.</p>

<p>First, I followed the selected answer from the link, however it seemed that mixing the layout settings like that caused about a 10 second delay in getting my image (before it was about a second). So I deleted that and then I followed the last answer on that link (idk how to link to the anchor of his answer). After that, the same drastic delay happened so I reverted everything and ran the program again giving the same delay!</p>

I've imported <code>myvfs</code> in <code>Console.as</code>:</p>

<p>And created vfs object:</p>

Apart from usual tasks like play/pause/stop/rewind etc., I need to apply some enhancement to the video like histogram equalization etc. A few enhancements are from some latest whitepapers, so I dont expect any api to have support for that. I would need to implement it on my own.So I am looking for some good apis which would help me to implement these custom image manipulation techniques on a per-frame basis.</p>

<p>I have seen many stackoverflow questions about java video player/manipulation and they have suggested to stay away from JMF and use others like vlcj,xuggler GStreamer etc. But I am not sure whether either of them supports custom enhancement techniques. Also the last question related to the topic was answered about 2 years ago(among those I could find). Also to play the video, I need some component. I have not explored the javafx MediaView about it.</p>

<p>So anyone has any experience about it that can we apply custom filters/enhancement to video played via javafx? And if not, then what alternatives I have to implement? </p>

<p>One example is function which sends all updated items to server.

<p>Right now, the function looks like this:</p>

<p><code>refreshLogin()</code> returns <code>Observable.just(new Object())</code>, <code>synchronizeInventories()</code> and <code>synchronizeItems()</code> return <code>Observable.empty()</code>.</p>

The Web service uses IBM Websphere MQ (7.0.1.2)  to do it's stuff and uses the SSL certificates stored in a key.kdb setup via IBMs KeyMan utility. </p>

<p>Normally (for C# apps that are not running IIS) I need to label the personal certificate within the kdb so that it's name matches the user that is running the app i.e. the certificate would be labelled as ibmwebspheremqbs6mjb (see <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21245474"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21245474</a>) and this allows the app to successfully access the SSL certificates within the key.kdb.</p>

<p>But..... when running as a Web service and naming the certificate ibmwebspheremqdefaultapppool the application cannot access the SSL certs. If I change the AppPool identity to be bs6mjb then everything works (I'm not allowed to run the app pool as bs6mjb).</p>

<p>I'd prefer not to setup a default certificate as mentioned in the link above, does anyone know what the certificate should be labelled as to work with DefaultAppPool?</p>

<p>Right now, I have just been able to accomplish the very basic task of connecting to Firefox plugin-container by directing it to the path using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>from pywinauto import application
app = application.Application()
app.connect_(path = r""c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\plugin-container.exe"")
</code></pre>

<p>The next step seems to be something to the effect of:</p>

<pre><code>app.plugin-container.Edit.TypeKeys('Text')
</code></pre>

<p>However, I can't reference the plugin-container window using '.plugin-container', or any combination of those words. I have tried adding a title variable to the connect_() function and I have tried everything I can think of to find out how to type the command. </p>

<p>The example I am basing this off of is the notepad sample:</p>

<pre><code>from pywinauto import application
app.start_(ur""notepad.exe"")
app.Notepad.Edit.TypeKeys(u""{END}{ENTER}SendText d\xf6\xe9s ""
        u""s\xfcpp\xf4rt \xe0cce\xf1ted characters!!!"", with_spaces = True)

<p>It doesn't matter to me if I use pywinauto or Firefox. If it is any easier to do this using a different module or Internet Explorer, I'm on board for whatever accomplishes the task. I am using Python version 2.7.2 and would prefer it over any version changes.</p>

<p>Any help at all is appreciated. I am pretty lost in all this.</p>

<p>the plugin is <a href=""http://threedubmedia.com/code/event/drag/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and demos are <a href=""http://threedubmedia.com/code/event/drag#demos"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Also my testing with jsfiddle is <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/patrioticcow/ubxYh/7/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a></p>

<p>The script begins with this:</p>

<pre><code>$('.drag')
    .live(""click"", function(){
        $( this ).toggleClass(""selected"");
    })
    .drag(""init"",function(){
        if ( $( this ).is('.selected') )
            return $('.selected');                      
    })
    .drag(""start"",function( ev, dd ){
        dd.attr = $( ev.target ).attr(""className"");
        dd.width = $( this ).width();
        dd.height = $( this ).height();
        dd.limit = $div.offset();
        dd.limit.bottom = dd.limit.top + $div.outerHeight() - $( this ).outerHeight();
        dd.limit.right = dd.limit.left + $div.outerWidth() - $( this ).outerWidth();
    })
    .drag(function( ev, dd ){
        var props = {};
        if ( dd.attr.indexOf(""E"") &gt; -1 ){
            props.width = Math.round(Math.max( 32, dd.width + dd.deltaX )/ 20 ) * 20;
        }
        if ( dd.attr.indexOf(""S"") &gt; -1 ){
            props.height = Math.round(Math.max( 32, dd.height + dd.deltaY )/ 20 ) * 20;
        }
        if ( dd.attr.indexOf(""drag"") &gt; -1 ){
            props.top = Math.round(Math.min( dd.limit.bottom, Math.max( dd.limit.top, dd.offsetY ) )/ 20 ) * 20;
            props.left = Math.round(Math.min( dd.limit.right, Math.max( dd.limit.left, dd.offsetX ) )/ 20 ) * 20;
        }
        $( this ).css( props );
});
</code></pre>

<p>it might look complicated but but all it does is makes some draggable divs hor this htnl:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""button"" id=""add"" value=""Add a Box"" /&gt;
&lt;div class=""test"" id=""container""&gt;


&lt;div class=""drag"" style=""left:100px;""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""handle SE""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=""drag"" style=""left:180px;""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""handle SE""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>then i use a button to add some more vids:</p>

<pre><code>var $div = $('#container');
var num = 1;
    $('#add').click(function(){
        $('&lt;div class=""handle SE""&gt;&lt;div class=""drag"" style=""left:20px;""/&gt;')
            .text( num++ )
            .appendTo( document.body )
            .wrap('&lt;div class=""drag"" style=""left:20px;""/&gt;');
    });
</code></pre>

<p>And the problem i have is that the newly created divs to dot inherit the already existing settings.</p>

<p>If i add separate code it will work with that:</p>

<pre><code>$('.drag').live(""drag"",function( ev, dd ){
        $( this ).css({
           top:  Math.round(dd.offsetY / 20 ) * 20,
           left:  Math.round(dd.offsetX / 20 ) * 20
        });
});
</code></pre>

<p>but i want the newly created blocks to use the first script. So i guess the problems is that the settings are not inherited </p>

<p>Any ideas?

<p>I've been working o a mac recently, and I found a problem with the compiler. I usually run algorithmic problems with input and output files. However, whenever there is a bug in my code, or if the input is bad, the program keeps running and eating my memory. I mean it does never crash and it makes my computer freeze. For example, if I read from input till I reach 0, and I forget to put the 0, it uses the whole memory(over 2gb) and cpu while never stopping and I have to find a way to force close the program or reboot. How can I put a limit to memory and running time of my c++ programs? Note that I use a text editor(sublime text2) and build my file with its default build configuration. Thank you!</p>

<p>So I have a viewmodel which contains an object that contains a list of Questions. I'd like to validate a property on the questions, where if another object (in this case a list) on the question is null, than the validation for that property should fail.</p>

<p>I have implemented the server side part of this and it works perfectly. The ObjectInstance is a Question and I can retrieve my other property from it.</p>

<p>However for the client side I don't have the object instance to work with. Instead I have the container and containertype. Easy right? They seem the same as the object instance so I can use those. Well the ContainerType is of type Question, but the Container itself is my ViewModel instance. This puts me at a loss. I've looked through the metadata and i've searched on the internet for hours but I can't find a way to retrieve my object instance.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>So my question is, how can I retrieve my object instance or can I validate my requirement in another way?</p>

<p><strong>IsValid method</strong></p>

<pre><code>protected override ValidationResult IsValid(object value, ValidationContext validationContext)
    {
        var containerType = validationContext.ObjectInstance.GetType();
        var field = containerType.GetProperty(_otherProperty);

        if (field != null)
        {
            var otherProperty = field.GetValue(validationContext.ObjectInstance);
            var option = Convert.ToString(value);
            if (otherProperty == null)
            {
                return new ValidationResult(FormatErrorMessage(validationContext.DisplayName));
            }
            return ValidationResult.Success;
        }
        return new ValidationResult(FormatErrorMessage(validationContext.DisplayName));
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>GetClientValidationRules method</strong></p>

<pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;ModelClientValidationRule&gt; GetClientValidationRules(ModelMetadata metadata, ControllerContext context)
    {
        //var depProp =  metadata.ContainerType.GetProperty(_otherProperty).GetValue(metadata.Container);
        var rule = new ModelClientValidationRule();
        rule.ErrorMessage = FormatErrorMessage(metadata.GetDisplayName());
        rule.ValidationParameters.Add(""otherproperty"", depProp);
        rule.ValidationType = ""requiredifempty"";
        yield return rule;
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Custom jQuery validation</strong></p>

<pre><code>if (jQuery.validator &amp;&amp; jQuery.validator.unobtrusive) {
            jQuery.validator.unobtrusive.adapters.addSingleVal(""requiredifempty"", ""otherproperty"");

            jQuery.validator.addMethod(""requiredifempty"", function (value, element, requiredifempty) {

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I understand that something like <code>Database.forURL(""jdbc:mysql://localhost/dbName"")</code> could work, but then it also requires user name, password, etc, which already exists for a default connection <code>DB</code>, so it doesn't make much sense entering all those settings again.</p>

<p>We already have some preferences system that allow users to describe their self. Hair color, wear-style, height, weight, shape, hobbies, etc.</p>

<p>We face the fact that some option list (content of combo box) need to be edited by admin user and translated in many languages (we already use the classic's yml support for i18n in Rails 3).</p>

<p>The admins, want to add users descriptions.</p>

<p>For instance imagine you have a user model with :
date of birth, Current city, mail, username</p>

<p>We already have everything ready with has_many and related tables named preferences.
We use a seed that contain :</p>

<p>hair_style :</p>

<ul>
<li>long</li>
<li>short</li>
<li>semi-long</li>
</ul>

<p>hair_color :  </p>

<ul>
<li>red</li>
<li>white</li>
<li>brown</li>
<li>black</li>
<li>blond</li>
</ul>

<p>eye_colors :
 - brown
 - green
 - yellow
 - blue</p>

<p>Now, the administrator want to add pink to the hair color and gray to the eye_colors property. Also he wants this to preferences/descriptions to be well translated for french users and so he need to translate them.</p>

<p>To summarize we have two issues :</p>

<ul>
<li>on-the-fly and non-model bind descriptions preferences (we know the list is going to get larger and larger has many idea will pop up)</li>
<li>translation of this descriptions as we can not use yml files here.</li>

After I set the IPLimit integer in the DjangoRatings settings.py file, everything works fine; however, when I exceed the number of votes that I have allowed per IP, the entire web page gets reloaded with an “RaiseIPLimit()” error and the entire site goes down which necessitates reloading the previous page via back button. My question is, what can I add to my views.py file to tell django that when DjangoRatings passes the RaiseIPLimit() error, simply print something like “You can only vote once!” message to the user and leave the loaded web page as it is instead of crashing the entire site.</p>

<p>If there’s an easier way to do this general IP checking besides DjangoRatings, I am open to implementing other ways, but DjangoRatings just seems much easier than anything else since the only thing I need IP limits on is rating stuff. To be more clear, here is the exact error that DjangoRatings gives me:</p>

<pre><code>IPLimitReached at /myapp/rating /page1 
</code></pre>

<p>And this is straight from the DjangoRatings source code:</p>

<pre><code>              num_votes = Vote.objects.filter(
                  content_type=kwargs['content_type'],

                  key=kwargs['key'],
                  ip_address=ip_address,
              ).count()
              if num_votes &gt;= getattr(settings, 'RATINGS_VOTES_PER_IP', RATINGS_VOTES_PER_IP):
                  raise IPLimitReached() ...
          kwargs.update(defaults)
          if use_cookies:
              # record with specified cookie was not found ...
              cookie = defaults['cookie'] # ... thus we need to replace old cookie (if presented) with new one
              kwargs.pop('cookie__isnull', '') # ... and remove 'cookie__isnull' (if presented) from .create()'s **kwargs

we just recently migrated to version 1.3.2 and found a change in the order of attributes of the generated POJOs.</p>

<p>Previously, the order of the attributes in the generated classes was alphabetical, but after the change, we've realized that in the XxxKey classes, i.e., the classes that match the primary key of the table, the order of the attributes is no longer alphabetical.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><em>Version 1.3.1:</em></p>

<pre><code>public class PoolChargingKey {
    private String billingCycle;
    private Integer commercialGroupId;
    private Short destinationId;
    private Integer tariffPlanId;
    private String trafficCase;
    private Integer zoneId;
[...]
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><em>Version 1.3.2:</em></p>

<pre><code>public class PoolChargingKey {
    private Integer commercialGroupId;
    private Integer tariffPlanId;
    private Integer zoneId;
    private Short destinationId;
    private String basicService;
    private String trafficCase;
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>We are accessing the generated POJOs with reflection for some mocking utils, and the change in the attributes order broke it.
We can fix the affected changes, but it would be great to indicate how the classes are generated.</p>

<p>Is it possible to do that? I guess the answer is no, but just in case.
By the way, the attribute order in version 1.3.1 was alphabetic.
In which order are the attributes generated in version 1.3.2?</p>

Tomas.</p>

<p><code>Connection URL: mysql://$OPENSHIFT_MYSQLDB_HOST:$OPENSHIFT_MYSQLDB_PORT</code></p>

<p>When looking at my environment variables on my APPLICATION A server, I see they are:</p>

<pre><code>OPENSHIFT_MYSQLDB_PORT=3306
OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_HOST=127.7.171.129
</code></pre>

<p>But when I try to connect:</p>

<pre><code>$db = new mysqli('127.7.171.129', 'adminuser', 'adminpw', 'productiondb',3306);
</code></pre>

<p>And I dump out this:</p>

<pre><code>object(mysqli)#1 (17) {

<p>The strangeness began when we attempted to use Reflection to change the <code>@Autowired</code> service instance that was contained within the Controller after the application context was created.</p>

<p>We tried to use <code>ReflectionUtils</code>, <code>ReflectionTestUtils</code> and just vanilla reflection but the instance of the class would not change at all. We confirmed that the reflection was making the field accessable, because it is a private field (using <code>field.isAccessible()</code> before and after the <code>field.setAccessible(true)</code>, but the instance ID refused to change. This was confirmed multiple times by checking the instance using <code>toString()</code> and also <code>println()</code> statements in both the mocked and genuine services.</p>

<p>I'll post the code below:</p>

<p>Controller Test Class:</p>

<pre><code>public class PromoteFooControllerTest extends SpringTest {

    private MockHttpServletRequest request;
    private MockHttpServletResponse response; 
    private AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter adapter;
    private FooController fooController;
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier(""MockFooHelperSuccess"")
    private FooHelper mockFooHelper;

    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        adapter = new AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter();

        HttpMessageConverter[] messageConverters = {new MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter()};
        adapter.setMessageConverters(messageConverters); 
        /*Snipping boring request setup*/
    }   
    @Test 
    public void promoteFooTest() {
        System.out.println(""Testing auto promote controller "");
        try {
            PromoteServiceResponse response = executePromoteController();
            assertTrue(response.getBrokerCenterURL() != null);
            assertTrue(response.getError() == null);

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            fail(""Should have passed."");
        }
    }
    private PromoteServiceResponse executePromoteController() throws Exception {
        fooController = applicationContext.getBean(FooController.class);
        //Reflection happening here
        Field field = fooController.class.getField(""fooHelper"");
        field.setAccessible(true);
        //Next line does nothing!!!
        field.set(fooController, mockFooHelper);
        response = new MockHttpServletResponse();
        adapter.handle(request, response, fooController);
        String fooServiceResponse = response.getContentAsString();
        System.out.println(fooServiceResponse); 
        return Miscellaneous.fromJSON(new TypeReference&lt;PromoteServiceResponse&gt;() {
            }, fooServiceResponse);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Actual FooController implementation:</p>

<pre><code>@Controller
@RequestMapping(value = ""/foo"")

    @Autowired
    FooHelper fooHelper;

        attributes = new ServletRequestAttributes(request);
        RequestContextHolder.setRequestAttributes(attributes);

<p>Mocked Helper:</p>

<pre><code>@Component(""MockFooHelperSuccess"")

<p>We eventually got it to work by changing a single line of code in the test class. We changed</p>

<pre><code>fooController = applicationContext.getBean(FooController.class);
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>fooController = new FooController();
</code></pre>

<p>and the entire thing worked perfectly using both vanilla reflection and <code>ReflectionTestUtils</code>.</p>

<p>We also tried adding a getter/setter inside the controller <sub>(yes, we were that desperate)</sub> and manually set the instance of <code>FooHelper</code> inside the controller from the application context which also worked.</p>

<pre><code>fooController = applicationContext.getBean(FooController.class);
fooController.setFooHelper(mockFooHelper);
response = new MockHttpServletResponse();
adapter.handle(request, response, fooController);
</code></pre>

<p>But our desire to get a test working was outweighed by our desire to NOT put a setter in a controller.</p>

<p>So our question is, why did Reflection fail to actually change the field instance. It was our understanding that Reflection is akin to the ultimate skeleton key for all Objects. We suspect that something in the Spring application context was either preventing the change from occurring or reverting the change at some point before the next line was run (because we had <code>println()</code> on the very next line.</p>

<p>I guess things got complicated for me when I started thinking about Eclipse workspaces vs. local git files. I am now very confused on the most efficient way to be syncing between two computers. I am able to do it now, but it's very cumbersome and ALWAYS the project-properties is incorrect about the path to the ActionBarSherlock library.</p>

<p>Also, should I have a full copy of my project in my workspace AND in the local git directories? I believe I should as one mirrors the other? Or should I only have 1 physical set of files, in the local git directories, which is logically referenced to from Eclipse (as opposed to having the physical files copied to the workspace itself).</p>

I've created an instance of Color Converter DSP via CLSID_CColorConvertDMO and then tried to set the needed input/output types, but the calls always return E_INVALIDARG even when using media types that are returned by <code>GetOutputAvailableType</code> and <code>GetInputAvailableType</code>. If I set the media type to <code>NULL</code> then i get the error that the media type is invalid, that makes sense. I've seen examples from MSDN, where people do the same - enumerate available types and then set them as input types - and they claim it works, but i'm kinda stuck on the E_INVALIDARG.

I've been looking for a robust third party library which could manage this, so we don't have to do maintenance on it as much. So far my search has not been very helpful. Most results have come back suggesting Spring, but I don't think that is satisfies our needs.</p>

<p>Things we need out of the library:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintain the 'initialization state' of dependencies in the system. This would mean if each 'service', as I'll call them, is already instantiated, but can be uninitialized, initializing, initialized. Most of these are singletons. </li>
<li>Maintain a dependency graph of each service, and only attempt to initialize when all dependencies have been initialized.</li>
<li>Most importantly, this must allow for asynchronous initialization. When a service is called to initialize, the library should not expect this to be done after calling <code>init()</code>, but allow the service to call back. This is because most of the services are making calls to our web service as part of their initialization.</li>
<li>The system needs to support uninitialization. eg. If we lose connection to the web service, or your session expires for one of the services, we need to be able to set it as uninitialized, invalidating everything that depends on it, and queuing for re-initialization.</li>
<li>The system should allow analysis of the system in its current state, so we can track what is initialized, and what depends on what.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've looked at Spring and Guice already, and from what I can tell, they won't work, because they don't allow your dependencies to be in an intermediate initialization state, and will block the thread if you ask for an uninitialized object, until it is fully constructed. I'm also not sure if they permit uninitialization.</p>

<p>I'm fully aware that this may be very specific, and possibly a strange system (it is quite old), so I expect that there may not be an alternative to an in-house solution.</p>

my thinking is: take anything between quotes <em>not</em> prefixed with \</p>

<pre><code>(?&lt;!\\)\"".+(?&lt;!\\)\""
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>(?&lt;!\\)\""</code>   should screen for "" but not \"" but Python complains about unbalanced parenthesis. 
if I use <code>(?&lt;!\\\)\""</code>  Python is happy , but this doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>re.findall('(?&lt;!\\\)\"".+(?&lt;!\\\)\""','""this is \""the\"". key"".""and this.is.the.child""')
</code></pre>

<p>leads:</p>

<pre><code>['""this is ""the"". key"".""and this.is.the.child""']
</code></pre>

<p>when I expect:</p>

<pre><code>['""this is ""the"". key""', '""and this.is.the.child""']
</code></pre>

<p>split at the dot which is enclosed with "" without escape.</p>

<p>I feel like i need an 'anything but not escaped double quote ' in the middle, but if 
<code>[^""]</code> screens for anything but a double quote, I don't know how to negate the <code>(?&lt;!\\\)\""</code> expression within a [ ] set that takes characters as literals.
i would want something like <code>[^(?&lt;!\\\)\""]</code> but that doesn't work.</p>

<p>I tried things like [[^""]|(\"")]+   (anything but a double quote, or a \""  ) but that doesn't seem to work either...</p>

<p>Can;t seem to find the right way to do this...
Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks for help</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>My real goal is to be able to split full 'text' JSON key names to transform them into alphanum only values. The transform is irrelevant here, but the goal is to split the keys to represent the hierarchy properly. The keys are in text form. </p>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>

<p>even though OmnipotentEntity is most likely right, writing a parser will have to wait..
This solution below doesn't support the ""\"" or ""\\"" cases as indicated in his comments.</p>

<p>I settled with </p>

<pre><code>""(?:\\""|[^""])*?""|(?&lt;=\.)[^"".]+?(?=\.)|^[^"".]+?(?=\.)|(?&lt;=\.)[^"".]+?$
</code></pre>

<p>inspired by the answer from Avinash Raj
but adding support for keys that are not enclosed in double quotes: 
no quotes beginning of line ending with . 
.key.
and 
.lastkey 
when substituting [empty] with the same regex, one should find 1 less element than the number of found strings, or there is an error.
something like .. outside """" will fail that test</p>

The option is stored as an array in php ie <code>update_option('box_order',$box_array);</code> I have echoed out an array of these boxes in order onto a page that has jQuery UI to allow for dragging reordering.</p>

<p>I listen for reordering and call this function via JS</p>

<pre><code>var order = jQuery( ""#sortable"" ).sortable( ""toArray"" );//get array of ids in order
jQuery('input.order-display').val(order); //set input field val to order array
</code></pre>

<p>This all works fine and I get the input[type=text] displaying the new order on shuffle.</p>

<p>However - I have a submit button and once ordering is finished I need to submit the form. The thing is I am working along side an existing plugin that cannot be modified. This PHP plugin takes the inputs contents and calls <code>update_option('box_order',$_POST['input_name']);</code></p>

<p>Do you guys have any suggestions as to how I can make the javascript array match the syntax of a php array exactly so that when the form is submitted it is used to update the Wordpress option via the plugin that I have no control over. I don't want to name the plugin as it is a surprise project but I'm building an open source addition.</p>

<p>I know about JSON.stringify() etc but that is not an option as only the $_POST of the input itself is being listened for by the PHP plugin.</p>

<p>My testing environment is running IIS6 asp.net 2.0, I have set it up with </p>

<pre><code>'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' *
</code></pre>

<p>I have also set the verbs for .asmx extensions to</p>

<pre><code>""GET,HEAD,POST,DEBUG,OPTIONS""
</code></pre>

<p>via jQuery v1.7.2 ajax() calls I am able to GET xml files from the sever, and POST to a basic service that returns a string with expected results cross domain.  So I KNOW at least partially my cross-domain requests are working.</p>

<p>My issue arises when I start to expand on that, and use json to post data to the service </p>

<p>I have a simple asmx webservice method:</p>

<pre><code>        [WebMethod]
        [ScriptMethod(ResponseFormat = ResponseFormat.Json)]
        public SubResponse HelloWorldX(SubRequestXX SubReq)
        {
            SubResponse sr = new SubResponse();

            sr.resultCode = ""777"";
            sr.resultMsg = ""hello - "" + SubReq.EmailAddress;

            return sr;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Very simple, and not much magic happening there, all I want to do is pass 'SubRequestXX' object in, and for now simply validate it got there and respond.</p>

<pre><code>Using jQuery:

    $.ajax({
        type: ""POST"",
        url: ""http://somedomain/subscription/MyService.asmx/HelloWorldX"",
        processData: false,
        data: '{ ""SubReq"" : {""EmailAddress"":""user@test.com""} }',
        dataType: ""json"",
        contentType: ""application/json; charset=utf-8"",
        cache: false,
        success: function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {
            ajaxSucccess3(data, textStatus, jqXHR);
        },
        error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {
            console.log(""Retrieve Hello Failed (AJAX Error): "" + jqXHR.statusText + "" | "" + textStatus + "" | "" + errorThrown);
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps the answer lies there? but here's what fiddler's RAW data shows me using the exact same JS code from a page on the same domain (success - result code 200):</p>

<pre><code>REQUEST:
    POST http://somedomain/subscription/Service.asmx/HelloWorldX HTTP/1.1

<p>So... the big Question... Why are my cross-site requests failing with the same code, despite all the above?  Seems like as soon as the request comes from another domain it chokes on JSON.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated solving this mystery.  I assume its either a IIS6 (server) setting or my $.ajax() call and I feel like its probably something simple or small, but I can't seem to put my finger on it.</p>

I've tried using Activate(), BringToFront(), Focus() as well as some Win32 calls like SetForegroundWindow(), Setcapture() and SetActiveWindow()... however the best I can get any of them to do is to make the taskbar item start blinking to tell me that it <em>wants</em> to have focus, but something is stopping it.

<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12867450/special-characters-in-google-calculator"">Special Characters in Google Calculator</a></p>

<p>I noticed when grabbing the return value for a Google Calculator calculation, the thousands place is separated by a rather odd character. It is not simply a space.</p>

<p>Let's take the example of converting $4,000 USD to GBP.</p>

<p>If you visit the following Google link:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/ig/calculator?hl=en&amp;q=4000%20usd%20to%20gbp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/ig/calculator?hl=en&amp;q=4000%20usd%20to%20gbp</a></p>

<p>You'll note that the response is:</p>

<pre><code>{lhs: ""4000 U.S. dollars"",rhs: ""2 497.81441 British pounds"",error: """",icc: true}
</code></pre>

<p>This looks reasonable, and the thousands place appears to be separated by a whitespace character.</p>

<p>However, if you enter the following into your command line:</p>

<pre><code>curl -s ""http://www.google.com/ig/calculator?hl=en&amp;q=4000%20usd%20to%20gbp""
</code></pre>

<p>You'll note that the response is:</p>

<pre><code>{lhs: ""4000 U.S. dollars"",rhs: ""2?498.28243 British pounds"",error: """",icc: true}
</code></pre>

<p>That question mark (?) is a replacement character. What is going on?</p>

<p>AppleScript returns a different replacement character:</p>

<pre><code>{lhs: ""4000 U.S. dollars"",rhs: ""2†498.28243 British pounds"",error: """",icc: true}
</code></pre>

<p>I am also getting from other sources:</p>

<pre><code>{lhs: ""4000 U.S. dollars"",rhs: ""2�498.28243 British pounds"",error: """",icc: true}
</code></pre>

<p>It turns out that � is the proper Unicode replacement character 65533.</p>

<p>Can anyone give me insight into what Google is passing me?</p>

<ol>
<li>GET locations</li>
<li>GET locations/{id}/servers</li>
<li>GET locations/{id}/tenants</li>
<li>etc.</li>

<p>With each of these calls I end up with a different jQuery ajax call to a corresponding web service.  However my UI displays a summary page of sorts that displays a table for the results from each query.  It seems it would be really easy to build a single Knockout ViewModel that then has ObservableArrays for each query result but maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.  Either way I'm not sure how to consolidate the multiple calls to one model or utilize multiple models for each call.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any documentation or sample code they could share to point me in the right direction?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I want to acheive this end result/structure in my Knockout object.  Essentially it is a one to many relationship, one location to many servers or tenants.</p>

<p>I can't afford to use wildcard subdomain cookies (Cookies should not be available for other subdomains)</p>

<p>My solution for access control up until now was that every URL used for <code>handlers.domain.com</code> had a guid specific to the user. The handlers on the other site would assume the identity of the guid owner. This of course is not such a good security practice.</p>

<p>i was thinking about an alternative solution: All links to <code>handlers.domain.com</code> will actually be links to a redirector script on <code>www.domain.com</code> that will redirect to an encrypted time stamped url on <code>handlers.domain.com</code> which will then know for sure that it was accessed as a direct authenticated redirection from <code>www.domain.com</code>.
This solution will work fine on GET scenarios but will fail with handlers expecting POST data (up do big uploaded files)</p>

They are each separated by a comma and can be of an indefinite length.... what I'm wondering is if there is a way to convert each number back to a hex number, concatenate those hex numbers, and then convert that number to a decimal... I do not want to mess around with the rest of the conversion because I did not write the first part and pieces of it are necessary for other operations of the program... </p>

<p>So to put this visually for everyone:</p>

<p>Here is the decimal I have as of now:   (65, 222, 102, 102)</p>

<p>We have the following case.</p>

<p>We have a 15GB server running only SOLR4/Lucene and the JVM (no custom code)</p>

<p>We had allocated 2GB of memory and the JVM was using 1.9MB. At some point something happened and we run out of memory.</p>

<p>Then we increased the JVM memory to 4GB and we see that gradually, JVM starts to use as much as it can. It is now using 3GB out of the 4GB allocated.</p>

<p>Is that normal JVM memory usage? i.e. Does the JVM always use as much as it can from the allocated space?</p>

<p></p>

<p>the Element <code>com.unitnode.Drawing</code> is my Drawing View (the upper part). </p>

<p>I tried different things without success: </p>

<ol>
<li><em>defined 1 <code>ScrollView</code> over whole page and tried to limit the height of it -></em> vertical lines can't be drawn</li>
<li><em>changed <code>layout_height</code> to <code>wrap_content</code> -></em> no change. I defined it to <code>com.unitnode.Drawing</code> too, but the app shut down because of <code>onSizeChanged( )</code> method (width and height must > 0)</li>
<li>I tried to insert a ScrollView element after the drawing View. And added for this another Framelayout -> can't handle that </li>
</ol>

<p>If you need Java code, please let me know.</p>

<p>Please help me to change my code, so that the layout consists of two part (shown in picture)</p>

<p>EDIT: I changed my xml file to this (used <code>FrameLayout</code> because of correct formatting):</p>

<p><strong>UPD:</strong>
The problem with  element has been solved spontaneously and I didn't got the solution. I used neither <code>dojo.addOnLoad</code> nor <code>widgetsInTemplate : true</code>, it just started to work. But I have found the same problem again: when I added another  tag I can't get it!<br>
HTML:  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;select class=""ctrl2"" dojotype=""dijit.form.ComboBox"" dojoAttachPoint=""selectPageNumber"" id=""selectPageNumber""&gt;

<p>widget:</p>

<pre><code>alert(this.selectPageNumber);
alert(this.selectPageNumber2);
</code></pre>

<p>first alert shows that <code>this.selectPageNumber</code> is a valid object and the <code>this.selectPageNumber2</code> is null.<br>
<code>widgetsInTemplate</code> is set to false.<br>
all the code is within <code>dojo.addOnLoad()</code><br>
<code>dojo.require()</code> is valid<br>

I heard that in the non-Mac world, GNUstep offers a good alternative to Cocoa, and can be used as a lerning tool for new objective-c developers. My question is, since GNUstep ports a lot of the Cocoa classes, what are the chances of me porting an iOS game + its development framework. I am talking about Canabalt for iOS (https://github.com/ericjohnson/canabalt-ios) which is based on the iOS version of the Flixel framework. I would like to know whether there is even the slightest chance of being able to port &amp; run this game on windows using GNUstep. Remember, that this is entirely for educational purposes, so please, do not look for any practical value in it, besides me getting better with ObjC :)</p>

<p>I guess that it should be technically possible. In general, what are the chances of porting any iOS app to Win using GNUstep?</p>

I can upload files just fine, single or multiple. They upload on a click of the individual item, or a ""Upload All"" button. The problem is trying to add additional files before or after uploading. The file upload plugin will not even detect that these files are changing in the file input, so it never fires the ""fileuploadadd"" event, and requires me to refresh the page in order to upload more files. I'm wondering whether the fileupload change event is being lost somewhere, but I cannot for the life of me figure out where.</p>

<p>Also, does the blueimp file upload plugin require a specific return format of JSON? At the minute, I'm just returning <code>""{\""status\"":\""success\""}</code> if the uploads are a success, and a similar error message. <strong>EDIT:</strong> Changing the response format to examples shown by blueimp had no effect.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT by blasteralfred</strong></p>

<p>I used FireBug for debugging and the problem was the same as expected. DOM object is unable to read updated data. Is this declaration for getting the DOM element correct? This is the only problem !</p>

<pre><code> var getbook = $('#book_'+data.id);
</code></pre>

<p>This is how the  tag is declared:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class='book' id='book_&lt;?php echo $row2[2];?&gt;'&gt;
&lt;table width=""80%"" align=""left""&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td width=""10%""&gt;&lt;?php echo $alter;?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=""70%"" class=""description""&gt;&lt;?php echo $row2[3];?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=""10%"" align=""center""&gt;&lt;a class=""edit"" href=""#""&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

I would like to develop an automated method that would produce the maximum message per second rate on a given hardware.</p>

<p>CONSTANTS:</p>

<ul>
<li># of CPUs, memory, network and other hardware parameters are a constant (or at least there is a known maximum). </li>
<li>Version of OS and the messaging products is a constant (WebSphere MQ 7.5 for instance)</li>
<li>Message size </li>
<li>3 minutes to complete one test measurement</li>
</ul>

<p>DESIRED RESULT:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maximum rate of messages per second</li>
</ul>

<p>VARIABLES:</p>

<ul>
<li>OS tuning options (kernel, TCP and other network and memory stuff)</li>
<li>Messaging software tuning settings - of which there are several dozens (buffer sizes of all sorts, number of threads, number of Queue Managers, number of queues, different kinds of bindings for clients, security settings, log types, number and sizes of log and data files, etc.....)</li>
<li>Number of message producers and consumers (say a range from 1 to 10,000)</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently performance tuning is done as an iterative process - change one variable at a time, measure msg/sec, rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>I have developed a script framework that can iterate over different settings, but if I do this as a nested loop that is 50 levels deep and iterate over every possible value for each variable this process will take hundreds of years to complete. Including a random factor might help, but what I would like to do is to use neural network to find optimum settings for my tuning variables.</p>

<p>I found some research papers that talk about this kind of thing, but could not find any real implementations. Has anybody done it? Any recommendations on how to proceed? I have not worked with neural networks, but have done mathematical programming (optimization) in university and normal optimization methods will take too long to solve this problem.</p>

<p>Here's the flow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Call <code>loadTracks()</code></li>
<li><code>loadTracks()</code> should load the tracks of a SoundCloud user, 50 at a time, until the list runs out.</li>
<li><code>loadTracks()</code> does this by calling another function, <code>sc.getTracksByUser(id)</code>, which returns a promise</li>
<li><code>loadTracks()</code> should update the variable <code>$scope.tracks</code> with each 50 track batch when it arrives</li>
</ul>

<p>The SoundCloud API provides an option <code>offset</code>, so loading the batches is relatively easy. I think it's the promise that is tripping me up. Without the promise, the solution would be:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.tracks = [];

var loadTracks = function() {
    var page = -1,
        done = false,
        newTracks;

    while (!done) {
        newTracks = getFiftyTracks(page++);
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; newTracks.length; i++) {
            $scope.tracks.push(newTracks[i]);
        }
        if (newTracks.length &lt; 50) done = true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, that line with <code>getFiftyTracks</code> in it is not how it works. The actual implementation (using a promise) is:</p>

<pre><code>sc.getTracksByUser(id).then(function (response) {
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; response.length; i++) {
        $scope.tracks.push(response[i]);
    }
}

Each packet consist from header and payload. in header, there is only one short int - i call it seqnum, running from 0 to SHORT_MAX. When client reaches SHORT_MAX on sending, it starts again from 0. </p>

<p>On the server I need to reconstruct stream in this way: </p>

<p>a) If packet arrives with expected seqnum append to the stream.</p>

<p>b) If packet arrives with lower than expected seqnum - drop it - it is packet which arrived to late</p>

<p>c) If packet arrives with higher seqnum than expected - consider packets between expected and actual seqnum as lost and try to reconstruct them and after that append actual packet</p>

<p>I am dealing now with two problems connected to overflow of counter:</p>

<p>1) how to detect situation c) on SHORT_MAX boundary (e.g. expected is SHORT_MAX-2, actual seqnum in packet is 2) - in my scenario it would be wrongly detected as situation b)</p>

B/c of a software glitch, it's possible that the customer could fill out the same survey twice or could receive a completely seperate survey for the same agent witin 30 days of the first survey (both scenarios should not happen). Management has made the decision to allow historical results up to October. However, from October moving forward (based off of survey date), until they get the code fixed, I need to exclude these results from our reports via a SQL statement.</p>

<p>Consider this hypothetical screenshot:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/RCoCt.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Notice how John Doe had a 2nd survey sent to the same customer within 30 days of the first (same thing with Tim Banks). In this scenario, we'd want only the FIRST survey to show up in the output (based off of Survey Date). Conversely, notice how Jane Doe has 2 surveys sent to the same email but they're outside of that 30-day window based off of the first surveydate.</p>

<p>The output/results would look something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/EckR9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Note that this only counts for surveys where the survey date is >= 10/1/2013. Anything prior is allowed.</p>

The Google group discussion on the Date.js library is moribund and I thought this may help some one.</p>

<p>Date.parse(myDateString) is unable to parse Date Only strings correctly when presented with an ambiguous string.
e.g. ""2014-10-02"" returns Feb 10 2014.</p>

<p>Stepping into the Library shows that it is expecting a full DateTime string.
So adding midnight to the string before parsing is a workaround.
e.g. var k = ""2014-10-02T00:00:00Z""
var d = Date.parse(k); Yields 2 Oct 2014.</p>

<p>The 'examples' and 'remarks' sections are both optional and there can be multiple 'slide' sections.</p>

<p>I'm moving the site over to DocPad and have decided to transform all of the existing markup to Markdown format. Markdown lacks a way to structure pages, so I've attempted various techniques to reintroduce my required structure, without success.</p>

<p>I'm using Robotskirt/Sundown and have found that if I write the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> inline in the .md files:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""slide""&gt;
  ( slide content )
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The slide content is not processed as Markdown. Supposedly, adding a <code>markdown=""1""</code> attribute ought to make this work. But it doesn't. Perhaps Sundown doesn't understand that.</p>

<p>My latest attempt was to use inline replacements to pre/post process the content (unsure at which stage the replacement was made). I added the following inline replacements to <code>docpad.config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>plugins:
  robotskirt:
    inline:
      # Slides etc.
      out = out.replace /^---\s*start (\w+)\s*---$/g, (whole, m1) -&gt;
        hash '&lt;div class=""' + m1 + '""&gt;'
      out = out.replace /^---\s*end (\w+)\s*---$/g, (whole, m1) -&gt;
        hash '&lt;/div&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>And added markers to the .md files:</p>

<pre><code>--- start slide ---

( slide content )

--- end slide ---
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but because replacement occurs on 'normal text' I end up with spurious paragraphs:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=""slide""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any workable technique for this, or should I just bin Markdown?</p>

I can set breakpoint and wait until it reached. When it did i want to call objc_msgSend with known parameters, get it's output and continue execution. For now i am simulating it's process in xcode and lldb, so i can not use just 'call objc_msgSend(object, _cmd)'.</p>

<p>what i do:</p>

<ul>
<li>set breakpoint to some code</li>
<li>register read pc // read next operation address</li>
<li>register write lr 0x0x0000253a // set return address to continue execution (pc value)</li>
<li>register write pc 0x30300c88 // my objc_msgSend address</li>
<li>register write r0 0x16ed30 // my object address</li>
<li>register write r1 0x3161 // my selector address</li>
<li>breakpoint set -a 0x0x0000253a</li>
<li>continue</li>
</ul>

<p>So i have my method called, but then app crashes and never reaches my 'return address' 0x0x0000253a. Also it rewrites r0 with return value, so my method is totally incomplete. I understand that what i do is hardcore overwriting registers without storing and restoring previous values so please help. How can i store/restore registers state, what i am doing wrong or what necessary things i do not do?</p>

<p>Also it could be very helpful to trace xcode's debugger for what it is doing while 'call objc_msgSend'. I tried to use <a href=""https://github.com/crackleware/idevice-app-runner"" rel=""nofollow"">this code</a> and fruitstrap to use dtruss and then research it's output - it had thousands of memory reads and breakpoint sets, useless for me.</p>

<p>Get 500 consecutive words from DB</p>

<pre><code>words = Words.objects.all()[wordId:wordId+500]
# I first create paragraphs, through which I can loop later in my django template,
# and in each para will be a list of words (also dictionaries). 
# So i am trying to get a dictionary with values that are lists of dictionaries. 
# 'pp' i make just for shorthanding a long-named variable.
paras={}
para_high = para_low =  words[0].belongs_to_paragraph
for w in words:
    last_word = w
    pp = w.belongs_to_paragraph
    if pp &gt;para_high:
        para_high = pp
    if pp &lt; para_low:
        para_low = pp
    if pp in paras:
        paras[pp].append(w)
    else:
        list = [w]
        paras[pp] = list
# Since there are blank lines between paragraphs, in rebuilding the text as it 
    #  looked originally, I need to insert blank lines. 
    # Since i have the ID's of the paragraphs and they go somewhat like that: 1,3,4,8,9 
    #(the gaps between 1 &amp; 3 and 4 &amp; 8 i have to fill in with something else, 
    # which is why i had para_low and para_high to loop the range. 
isbr = True
for i in range(para_low, para_high+1):
    if i in paras:
        isbr = True
    else:

            isbr = False
        else:
            paras[i]=[]
</code></pre>

<p>At this point however, If i try to loop the dict and try to rebuild the text, some later id-d paragraphs come before previous ones and just doesn't do it.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2, loop code:</p>

<pre><code>        {% for k,v in wording.iteritems()  %}
        {% if v[0] == 'break' %}

<p>exactly that strings have troubles:</p>

<pre><code>$ticket = ORM::factory('ticket');
$this-&gt;template-&gt;errors = $ticket-&gt;validate()-&gt;errors('validate_ticket');
</code></pre>

<p>the problem is that class Model_Ticket and all of its parents does not contain method validate(), but this method returns valid value.
how can this be possible?</p>

<p>next code shows that:</p>

<pre><code>echo 'get_class($ticket)='; echo get_class($ticket); echo ""\n"";

echo ""var_dump(method_exists(\$ticket,'validate'))=""; var_dump(method_exists($ticket,'validate')); echo '\n';

echo ""var_dump(method_exists('Model_Ticket','validate'))="";var_dump(method_exists('Model_Ticket','validate'));echo '\n'

echo 'get_class($ticket-&gt;validate())=';echo get_class($ticket-&gt;validate());
</code></pre>

<p>here what we got as result:</p>

<pre><code>get_class($ticket)=Model_Ticket
var_dump(method_exists($ticket,'validate'))=bool(false)
var_dump(method_exists('Model_Ticket','validate'))=bool(false)

The application pre-loads a few look-up tables with data, and since most have less than 20 records, the scripts run pretty quickly.  However, one of the scripts has 802 records, and takes 248.671 seconds to insert the records, which seems excessive for such a small amount of data with a database that advertises fast operations with large volumes of data.  </p>

<p>So I'm wondering, is there a faster way to insert data, via script, than the current way the script is written?</p>

<p>The table being inserted into is defined like so:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE FileIds
(
     Id                 NUMERIC(38)                         NOT NULL
    ,Name               NVARCHAR2(50)   DEFAULT 'Unknown'   NOT NULL 
    ,FileTypeGroupId    NUMERIC(38)                         NOT NULL
    ,CONSTRAINT FK_FileIds_FileTypeGroups FOREIGN KEY ( FileTypeGroupId ) REFERENCES FileTypeGroups ( Id )
)
</code></pre>

<p>And the script to insert looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN
    INSERT ALL
        INTO FileIds ( Id, FileTypeGroupId ) VALUES (1152,5)
        INTO FileIds ( Id, FileTypeGroupId ) VALUES (1197,10)
        INTO FileIds ( Id, FileTypeGroupId ) VALUES (1200,6)
        INTO FileIds ( Id, FileTypeGroupId ) VALUES (1143,3)
        INTO FileIds ( Id, FileTypeGroupId ) VALUES (1189,9)
        INTO FileIds ( Id, FileTypeGroupId ) VALUES (1109,7)
        INTO FileIds ( Id, FileTypeGroupId ) VALUES (1166,4)
        INTO FileIds ( Id, FileTypeGroupId ) VALUES (0,8)
        INTO FileIds ( Id, FileTypeGroupId ) VALUES (1149,2)
        INTO FileIds ( Id, FileTypeGroupId ) VALUES (1400,1)
        INTO FileIds ( Id, FileTypeGroupId ) VALUES (1330,11)
        INTO FileIds ( Id, FileTypeGroupId ) VALUES (1000,0)
        -- 790 Records removed for example purposes.
        SELECT * FROM DUAL;
    COMMIT;
END;
</code></pre>

<p>The FileTypeGroups table, referenced in the Foreign Key, is pre-loaded prior to the loading of the FileIds table.  There are no sequences or triggers associated with the FileIds table, and as of yet indexes have not been created for the table.</p>

This is done in Windows Explorer by right clicking the root svn folder, selecting the Subversion tab, properties, and import.  The import file filter starts off with svnprops.  After importing, the commit dialogue now has a place for entering in a bug ID.  When commiting through Tortoise, it works fine.  Viewing the log history shows a bug ID column with values.  </p>

<p>AnkhSVN shows the Bug ID box as well.  However, even though a value is entered, that doesn't translate into the Bug ID column when viewing history.  AnkhSVN ignores the Bug ID value.  </p>

<p>Essentially, I have several different queries that I'd like to display as pivot charts, pivot tables, tables, and reports.  Eventually I'm also going to have to build forms to manipulate the data as well, but the application's primary function is to display data.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of having a button for each different display down the left side of the main window, and having the rest of the window display each button's corresponding contents (e.g. a pivot chart).</p>

<p>I have an idea that this can be accomplished using a single subform in the main form, and setting the subform's Source Object property within a function such as this one:</p>

<pre><code>Public Function SetSubformSourceObject(newSourceObject) As Variant
    subform.SourceObject = newSourceObject
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>Then, for each button I'd set its OnClick property to call this function with the name of the query I'd like to run.</p>

<p>Now, I have no idea if this is the best way of going about things, and would really appreciate some input :)</p>

So I happily wrote a program in C++11 to sort lines of an input file to test my fresh skills. Because of inlining and nice features of C++ compilers I expected high performance on this small example. To get a hint at how fast was my program I hacked exactly the same program in C using the <code>qsort</code> function, since it is raw C no inlining is performed on this function and my comparison function is called with an indirection and needs to do two indirections to access <code>char *</code> pointers representing strings.</p>

<h1>The facts</h1>

<p>Yet, I was very surprised by the results, C seems 4 times faster than C++. On a 8Mb file, I get the following results:</p>

<pre><code>$ g++ -O3 -std=c++11 -o sort sort.C
$ time ./sort &lt; huge &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.415s
user    0m0.397s
sys     0m0.013s

$ cc -O3 -Wall -o sortc sort.c
$ time ./sortc &lt; huge  &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.104s
user    0m0.097s
sys     0m0.010s

$ wc -l huge
140190 huge
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I tried to be as fair as possible, compilation options are the same and my C program (dumped later) behave the same way as the C++ one: no limit on the size of the input lines and no limit on the number of input lines.</p>

<p>I also noticed that while my C program calls <code>malloc</code> almost once for each input line, the C++ program has a ratio of 10 allocations per input line!</p>

<h1>The code</h1>

<p>Here are the two programs I used to make my comparison.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;

int main () {
    typedef std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; svec;
    svec a;
    std::string s;

    for (;;) {
        getline(std::cin, s);
        if (std::cin.eof()) {
            if (s != """")
                a.push_back(std::move(s));
            break;
        }
        a.push_back(std::move(s));
    }
    std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    for (std::string &amp;s : a) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; ""\n"";

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>Could someone tell me where my C++ program must be changed (without becoming plain C) to be faster? I tried to stay very idiomatic, is it a good way to hack in C++ or should I tend to write C-like code when I want high performance? Why is the C++ program allocating that much on the heap, how can I reduce this?</p>

<p>I figured it out. Turns out iScroll has an option called: ""options.eventPassthrough""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>options.eventPassthrough
  Sometimes you want to preserve native vertical scroll but being able to add an horizontal iScroll (maybe a carousel). Set this to true and the iScroll area will react to horizontal swipes only. Vertical swipes will naturally scroll the whole page.
  See event passthrough demo on a mobile device. Note that this can be set to 'horizontal' to inverse the behavior (native horizontal scroll, vertical iScroll).

<p>The points match up with the names.</p>

<p>In my code I have a foreach name running a block that contains stats for each name. The block has the player name and an input that captures the points the player scores. </p>

&lt;span&gt;&lt;?php echo $player ?&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

 $points = $_POST['points'];

<p>I need to run a foreach loop but if I do the same loop as foreach name mentioned above then looping the <code>$player</code> or <code>$points</code> loops the correct amount of times but only one value.</p>

<p>SO I am not sure how to do an <code>array_combine</code> here or if I should use a different approach I know its easy but I cant figure it out. Pretty sure I need to loop the <code>$_POST</code> variable, but I think I also need to combine them.. I am all scrambled up, so to figure this out just put yourself as the developer and you need to update the <code>points</code> table to match up with the right <code>player</code> table</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>Thanks to posters below I can now work with both arrays better.</em></p>

<p>But to extend this question, it's weird when I use a variable to update the table it wont work. When I enter it manually it works <code>$sqlupdate = ""UPDATE stats SET points = 22 WHERE player = 'matt'"";</code> any idea why it wont work with a variable?</p>

So at a high level are components like we see on facebook - profiles, feeds etc. On a low level I am drilling down right to reservations at hotels across the world, restaurants etc. So lots of data, lots of searches, lots of analytic, lots of reads/writes.</p>

<p><strong>Current Platform:</strong> 1 MySQL database, Php Codeingiter, 1 Dedicated hosting server. Website is geo-location so world over, support multi lang and localization, must be real time. Plan to add CDN once launched. This will change once i finalize the exact technologies to use.</p>

<p><strong>Here are the list of concerned items:</strong><br>
1. Website searching: Photos / videos (name, description, people tagged in it), user defined tags, comments (like wall comments), posts, blogs, group, people searching by name/email.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Mail searches: searching subject, email content, sender, attachments.</p></li>
<li><p>Storing Basic user/system values: User details, system details, schema, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Storing &amp; implementing Live feeds: Real time feeds based on user activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Storing &amp; implementing Analytic: In house developed web analytic for system reporting + user analytic for business pages. This includes mixture of reports/graphs/metrics. So this will be a custom data warehouse.</p></li>
<li><p>Storing &amp; implementing Relationships: Find, maintain and show users degree in relationships, common items between various degrees.</p></li>
<li><p>Handling API calls so businesses can send/receive data like hotel/restaurant owners, etc</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>QUESTION - Can anyone suggest:</strong> Database to use - type and which brand exactly (relational, document, key value, graph, etc), database engine to use if rdms (InnoDB may not work in all cases), add on servers/file systems/cache like memcached, etc? Should i go normalized or de-normalized if rdms. Or NOSQL all the way.  </p>

<p>MySQL works for some parts, memcache works for some, lucene works for some parts, some parts like inbox may require a document database, relationships may require a graph database but I am not sure which one works exactly for which of the 7 items above and if i can use the same platforms/technologies for most of the above items. My only requirement is open source so it can be free to use and work with PHP. I don't want to implement a separate database/set of technologies to support each of the above 7 requirements. Ofcourse being a social network, performance and scalability are important too.</p>

When ever I am calling the if statement it is getting a null for the $_SESSION variable.  I have the session start in the header.php file at the top.  When the user logs in it creates the session with this code:</p>

<pre><code>public static function create_session($values) {
    foreach ( $values as $key =&gt; $value ) {
        if ($key != ""password"") {
            $_SESSION[$key] = $value;
        }           
    }

    $_SESSION[""timestamp""] = time();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It then redirects to an index page wich only contains:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
  echo ""&lt;pre&gt;"";
  print_r($_SESSION);
  echo ""&lt;/pre&gt;"";
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works, it prints all the session variables on the page just fine.</p>

<p>This is what prints out in the index.php file with the above code.</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
  [id] =&gt; 33
  [first_name] =&gt; removed to not show name
  [last_name] =&gt; removed to not show name
  [email] =&gt; test@test.com
  [timestamp] =&gt; 1437486426
)
</code></pre>

<p>In my footer.php file I have some jquery running a timed function every 5 seconds calling the timeout.php file.</p>

<pre><code>(function poll() {
   setTimeout(function() {
       $.ajax({ url: ""timeout.php"", success: function(data) {
            console.log(data);
       }, dataType: ""json"", complete: poll });
    }, 5000);
})();
</code></pre>

<p>The timeout php file only has this code in it:</p>

<pre><code>if (isset($_SESSION)) {
    if ($_SESSION['timestamp'] + 10 * 60 &lt; time()) {
        // session timed out
        echo json_encode(array('session' =&gt; $_SESSION, 'session_timestamp' =&gt; $_SESSION['timestamp'], 'timestamp_calculation' =&gt; $_SESSION['timestamp'] + 10 * 60, 'timeoutstatus' =&gt; 'timed out'));
    } else {
        // session ok
        echo json_encode(array('session' =&gt; $_SESSION, 'session_timestamp' =&gt; $_SESSION['timestamp'], 'timestamp_calculation' =&gt; $_SESSION['timestamp'] + 10 * 60, 'timeoutstatus' =&gt; 'not timed out'));
    }
} else {
    echo json_encode(array('session' =&gt; 'Session does not exits'));
}
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason I am getting the session does not exist.  If I remove that part of the if statement and just test the timeout all the json array variables that call $_SESSION return null.  I have no idea why this is.  I appreciate your help.</p>

<p>In response to this being a duplicate.  The original thought was that session_start() wasn't called.  I had mentioned it was called in the first paragraph and it comes before all other php code.  I have also confirmed that I can call the $_SESSION variable within the index page just fine.  I am only getting an issue when trying to read it through my ajax function which is being called from my footer.php.</p>

It runs fine, but obviously with the Python console in the background. I tried to change the shell command from <code>python</code> to <code>pythonw</code> (and renaming the file to <code>.pyw</code>) but then Windows always simply opens the ""open with..."" dialog and not the script. If I copy-paste the shell command and run it from cmd, it works. Running the <code>.pyw</code> from the explorer also works fine, without console.</p>

<p>Why is the behavior different when running it in the shell command?</p>

Every time you click/narrow down your search, all counters get recalculated for all filters.

<p>I have a situation where I am making two async requests in parallel, followed by a third async request which depends on the success of the first two, and finally passing the results of the second async request to the function callback.</p>

<p>As of now I understand how to do this in two ways (.catch statements and function signatures omitted for brevity):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Using scope closure (my current implementation)</p>

<pre><code>var foo;
Promise.join(promiseA, promiseB, function(resultsA, resultsB) {
  foo = resultsB;
  return promiseC;
})
.then(function() {
  // foo is accessible here
  callback(null, foo);
});
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Using Promise.bind, but have to use Promise.map instead of Promise.join</p>

<pre><code>var targetIndex = 1;
Promise.resolve(promises)
  .bind({})
  .map(function(response, index) {
    if (index === targetIndex) {
      this.foo = response;
    }
  })
  .then(function() {
    return promiseC;
  })
  .then(function() {
    // this.foo is accessible here
    callback(null, this.foo);
  });
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>As you can tell, option 2 is rather ugly since I have to manually check if the index parameter of the mapper matches the index of the promise result that I care about. Option 1 uses scope closure, which I understand is undesirable in most cases (but seems to be my best option at this point).</p>

<p>What I would really like to do is something like:</p>

<pre><code>Promise.bind({})
  .join(promiseA, promiseB, function(resultsA, resultsB) {
     this.foo = resultsB;
     return promiseC;
  })
  .then(function() {
    // I WISH this.foo WAS ACCESSIBLE HERE!
    callback(null, this.foo);
  });
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way for me to utilize Promise.join instead of Promise.map to avoid using a scope closure in this situation?</p>

<p>Can you please tell me where's my error and what i need to improve or correct in my code..<br>

What i'm basically trying to do is cover the US in 75 mile radius circles (based on zipcode) with as little overlap as possible.  I've been able to do zipcodes 75 miles apart but the problem is those overlap at 50%.  So I think if i include the distance to be 150 miles apart, this would cause as little overlap as possible.  Then i run into the issue of how do I know which area's of the US aren't covered?  So I would like to draw these radius circles on a map.  Does anybody have a good starting point?</p>

<p>Edit:  I also have the lat/lng with these zipcodes.  So essentially i'm saying 75 mile radius from zip code X.</p>

I have attempted to fix it in a few different ways to no avail so hopefully some light can be shed on this problem which hopefully is something simple I have overlooked.</p>

<p>Here is some code:</p>

I have a large (several GB) data structure that is updated once every few seconds. Many (read only) operations are going to run against this data structure between updates, in parallel, accessing it heavily. As soon as an update occurs, all computations in progress should be cleanly cancelled, as their results are invalidated by the update.</p>

<p>The issue I'm running into here is that writes are infrequent enough, and readers access so often that locking around individual reader access would have a huge hit to performance. I'm fine with the readers reading invalid data, but then I need to deal with any invariants broken (assertions) or segfaults due to stale pointers, etc. At the same time, I can't have readers block writers, so reader-writer locks acquired at every reader's thread start is unacceptable.</p>

<p>The only solution I can think of has a number of issues, which is to allocate a mapping with mmap, put the readers in separate processes, and mprotect the memory to kill the workers when it's time to update. I'd prefer a cross-platform solution (ideally pure C++), however, and ideally without forking every few seconds. This would also require some surgery to get all the data structures located in shm.</p>

<p>Something like a revocable lock would do exactly what I need, but I don't know of any libraries that provide such functionality.</p>

<p>I may be overthinking this but as far as I know how to go about doing this is just making a lot of arrays and looping through the json results and adding 1 to whichever array is assigned by that question/answer.</p>

<p>The JSON looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""xml"": {
    ""@version"": ""1.0"",
    ""@encoding"": ""UTF-8""
  },
  ""data"": {
    ""recordCount"": ""31"",

        ""label"": ""Which is your favorite choice?"",

          ""option"": [
            {
              ""@value"": ""Choice 1"",
              ""#text"": ""Choice 1""
            },
            {
              ""@value"": ""Choice 2"",
              ""#text"": ""Choice 2""
            }
          ]
        }
      }

    ""records"": {
      ""F_Form1"": [
        {
          ""@application_uid"": ""2fd81b31-5344-4e40-bfAA-a7967bb190de"",
          ""@id"": ""2"",
          ""@uid"": ""ea7b5bde-7cd9-332-8bc0-69c00ed981f6"",
          ""F_PollQuestion"": ""Choice 1""
        },
        etc etc....
</code></pre>

<p>So 2 big points of having this type of json result is that i know already how many answers to the poll I currently have: </p>

<p><strong>""recordCount"": ""31"",</strong>.</p>

<p>And I also know that there are only 2 vote answers for this particular form question: </p>

<p><strong>""@value"": ""Choice 1"",</strong></p>

<p><strong>""@value"": ""Choice 2""</strong>.</p>

<p>So all I really have to do is loop through the <strong>records</strong> section of the json results and check out the <strong>""F_PollQuestion"":</strong> value for each. After I get all the results stored then I would do some math on each to determine the percent for each result (which would be out of 2).</p>

<p>So my logic is correct - though putting it into action is what I am thinking I'm overthinking. If this can be done via <em>json.net</em> and output the percentage then that would be great!</p>

<p>Any help would be great!</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do in my code is run a new task for each stock in my list and run them all at the same time. I have a 4 core processor and I believe that means I can only run 4 tasks at once. I tried testing how many tasks were running by inserting the continuewith method that you see in my code that will tell me how many tasks are running. When I run this code, it tells me that 0 tasks are running so my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can I complete my objective by running these tasks at the same exact time?</li>
<li>Why is it telling me that 0 tasks are running? I can only assume this is because the current task is finished and it hasn't started a new one yet if the tasks are running one after the other.</li>

Specifically, why would I use an extension method when I have inheritance and interfaces at my disposal?  At first glance, extension methods don't seem to me like a very OO practice, and it seems like they would lead to less readable code as opposed to using subclasses and/or interfaces to achieve the same purpose.  Is there something special about extension methods that I'm missing?  When do you use them? </p>

&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>View is strongly typed against: <code>@model WebApplication2.Models.ApplicationUser</code> and is associated with Action <code>Details</code> in controller <code>ApplicationUsers</code>.</p>

<p>How to get value selected in  @Html.DropDownListFor inside the view and pass it to action in OTHER controller in my case?</p>

<hr>

<p>If it is not a problem I feel better with java script(I understand better what is going on).</p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>This is solution(mine) which lacks getting value from dropdown in java script function.</p>

<p>The dropdown list:</p>

<pre><code>    @Html.DropDownListFor(m =&gt; m.CallsToMake, new SelectList(Model.CallsToMake.OrderByDescending(call =&gt; call.TimeStamp), null), new { @class = ""btn btn-default dropdown-toggle"", style = ""width: 500px;"" })
</code></pre>

<p>The button when clicked <code>javascript:FetchCall()</code> is invoked:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""button"" id=""FetchCallButton"" value=""Fetch call"" onclick=""javascript:FetchCall()"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The JavaScript function:</p>

<pre><code> function FetchCall() {
        var url = '@Url.Action(""FetchCall, ""Person"")';  
        $.post(url, { callToMakeId: SELECTED_CALL_IN_DROPDOWN_ID_HOW_TO_GET_IT}, function (data) {
            alert('YES');
        });
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The action method in <code>PersonController</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult FetchCall(int callToMakeId) {...}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How to get selected <code>call.Id</code> in the java script function?</p>

<hr>

<h2>EDIT 2</h2>

<p>Thanks to Tommy's solution I've been able to read selection in dropdown list. The problem is that I get exacly what is written in the dropdown list which is result from <code>ToString()</code> inside <code>CallToMake</code> class. </p>

<p>function:</p>

<pre><code>function FetchCall() {
    alert($(""#CallsToMake"").val());
    var url = '@Url.Action(""FetchCall"", ""Person"")';
    $.post(url, { callToMakeId: $(""#CallsToMake"").val() }, function (data) {
        alert('YES');
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>I show in image below contents of the drop down and alert <code>alert($(""#CallsToMake"").val());</code>:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/aHfcB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The only solution that comes to my mind is to display <code>id</code> of the call in the dropdown list and then cut it out in the controller action. It sounds bad, isn't it?</p>

<h2>EDIT 3 </h2>

<p>The list finally looks like:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.DropDownListFor(m =&gt; m.CallsToMake, new SelectList(Model.CallsToMake.OrderByDescending(call =&gt; call.TimeStamp), ""Id"",""Id""), new { @class = ""btn btn-default dropdown-toggle"", style = ""width: 500px;"" })
</code></pre>

<p>java script:</p>

<pre><code>    function FetchCall() {
        alert($(""#CallsToMake"").val());
        var url = '@Url.Action(""FetchCall"", ""Person"")';
        $.post(url, { callToMakeId: $(""#CallsToMake"").val() }, function (data) {
            alert('YES');
        });
    }
=
</code></pre>

<p>and the Action method</p>

<pre><code> public ActionResult FetchCall(int callToMakeId) {
            CallToMake callToMake = db.CallsToMake.Find(callToMakeId);
            int idPersonToCall = callToMake.Callee.Id;
            db.CallsToMake.Remove(callToMake);
            db.SaveChanges();
            Debug.WriteLine(""I AM HERE"");
            return RedirectToAction(""Details"", new { id = idPersonToCall });
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Action method is being invoked but I am not redirected anywhere. Method just runs and that is all.</p>

<p>I need some guidance on <strong>how to deal with null values</strong> in my view model. Here's my scenario and the problem I'm running into:</p>

<p>Most of the data members returned by the REST API are <strong>nullable</strong>. To account for this, I'm passing to the mapping plugin a sample of JSON with null values:</p>

<pre><code>um.jsonMaps.campaign = {
    ""priority"": null,
    ""recipientListId"": null,
    ""autoPrepare"": null,
    ""timeToSend"": null
}
</code></pre>

<p>I do the initial binding like this:</p>

<pre><code>this.model = ko.mapping.fromJS(um.jsonMaps.campaign);
</code></pre>

<p>Here's some data from an API call:</p>

<pre><code>var data= {
    ""priority"": 95,
    ""recipientListId"": ""a2aac72a-59f6-45da-a636-a48cc2b20137"",
    ""autoPrepare"": false,
    ""timeToSend"": null
}
</code></pre>

<p>...which is bound like this:</p>

<pre><code>ko.mapping.fromJS(data, this.viewModel.model);
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>problem</strong> is that if users modify or touch any of the UI elements bound to this data, they implicitly turn the data member in the model into a <strong>quoted string literal</strong>. So, the integer <strong>95</strong> becomes <strong><em>""95""</em></strong> if the user adds some text and deletes it. And if a value that was null from the API is touched in the UI, it becomes <strong>""""</strong> (e.g. the empty string).</p>

<p>I need ints and nulls to remain as ints and nulls after editing.</p>

<p>In the beginning I tried to create a button and to use setImage() method to cover the button with my own design image. no matter what I tried I never succeeded to cover the hole button, the border of the old button always blinked from behind, or when I resized the shell my button image became too small to cover the old button.</p>

<p>I tryied to color the background of the old button, but it turns out that setBackground() method doesn't work on buttons. <br>
I have figured out that even though setBackground() doesn't work on button, it doe's work on lables. <br> So now I'm to turn a label to a clickable object by adding some kind of listener to him, but I can’t find a listener that can generate a click event for labels (MouseListener is only sensitive for double click)
 I will be glad to get some help with figuring out a better way do achive my goal, or a appropriate listener. </p>

<p>Im adding a link to the photo of the button. this photo show how the button looks when I strech the shell to maximum. my goal is to make the grey parts disappear.

The <code>Block</code> model lets one user block another. When one user blocks another, I want it to destroy the <code>Relationship</code> between them using a <code>before_save</code> method for the <code>Block</code> class. The <code>Relationship</code> table has a <code>follower_id</code> and a <code>followed_id</code>.</p>

<p>This is where things get tricky. I know I could achieve this goal by using multiple <code>return if Relationship.xyz.nil?</code> statements and then using multiple <code>Relationship.find_by(follower_id:  , followed_id:  ).destroy</code> statements, but this gets to be way over complicated because each <code>blocker</code> and <code>blocked_user</code> could be either the <code>follower</code> and <code>followed</code> id, both, or neither. Is there any easier way to do this?</p>

<p>Here's my models for reference: (also the <code>Block</code> class has a <code>blocked_post</code> field, which I'm having no trouble with)</p>

<pre><code>class Block &lt; ActiveRecord::Base

  if blocked_user_id.present?
    !(blocker_id == blocked_user_id)
  elsif blocked_post_id.present?
    blocked_post = Post.find_by(id: self.blocked_post_id).user_id
    !(blocker_id == blocked_post)
  else
    false
  end
end

def destroy_blocked_relationships
  #my over-complex code was here
end

end

<p>relationship.rb:</p>

<pre><code>class Relationship &lt; ActiveRecord::Base

<pre><code>    // Creamos los thumbnails
    $config = sfConfig::get('app_images_avatars');
    $original = new sfImage($this-&gt;getTempName());

We have been adjusting the DPI of these images so that when printed they will look as close as possible to what the original pdf looked like. We've found that at least a setting of 300 DPI matches roughly the clarity of what the pdf will display when printed. However if we try to load a GIF image with a setting of 300 DPI into the browser using HTML the image is very large and causes scrolling. I was able to get around it by setting the height and width of the image tag, however when/if the margins on the Print preferences changes the image will be chopped when printed. If we print the images as is through an image viewer they print fine. </p>

However i have no idea about real time data plotting using sound. Some people suggest GDI but as i said i am new and i think it will take too much time to use GDI efficiently.If i must learn GDI,pls share any article that can help a beginner like me. Actually i look like dont know where should i start. Need to be guided :)) And i have a question.</p>

<p>One of the tutorial of NAudio,he works with byte array to plot the waveform in Chart.It is fine if you know the size of wav file.However it works too slow and gives Out of Memory Exception for bigger wav files than 10mb.The code below refers to what i mean.</p>

    open.Filter = ""Wave File (*.wav)|*.wav;"";

Am I supposed to do something special with it? I am using another Java project that I referenced in the build path for the ""User"" class</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Well, I solved the old problem but now I have a new one which is really strange. TomcatEE, which is hosting my service doesn't seem to like the User class' setter methods.</p>

<p>Here is the service interface:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.Date;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.UUID;

import javax.jws.WebMethod;
import javax.jws.WebService;

import BioFlip.User;
import BioFlip.User.Permission;

@WebService(targetNamespace = ""http://bioflip.org/wsdl"")
public interface IUserService 
{
    @WebMethod
    public List&lt;User&gt; getUserList();

    @WebMethod
    public int getRegisteredUserCount();

    @WebMethod
    public List&lt;User&gt; getGuestList();

    @WebMethod
    public boolean isEnrolled(User user);

    @WebMethod
    public boolean enrollUser(User user);

    @WebMethod
    public boolean enrollUser(String firstname, String lastname, Permission permission, String phoneNumber, 
            String fingerImage, String faceImage, Date accessFrom, Date accessTo, Date lastLogin, UUID id);

    @WebMethod
    public boolean removeUser(User user);

    @WebMethod
    public User getEnrolledUser(UUID id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>What is strange is that the getter/setter methods in the User class seem to be messing with Tomcat.</p>

<p>The following will work, and Tomcat runs the server (setters commented out):</p>

<pre><code> /* Returns the user's last name */
  public String getLastName() {
    return lastname;
  }

  /* Sets the user's last name */
//  public void setLastName(String newLastName) {
//    lastname = newLastName;
//  }
//  
  /* Returns the user's first name */
  public String getFirstName() {
    return firstname;
  }

  /* Sets the user's first name */
//  public void setFirstName(String newfirstname) {
//    firstname = firstname;
//  }
</code></pre>

<p>The following causes Tomcat to crash:</p>

<pre><code>  /* Sets the user's last name */
//  public void setLastName(String newLastName) {
//    lastname = newLastName;
//  }
//  
  /* Returns the user's first name */
  public String getFirstName() {
    return firstname;
  }

  /* Sets the user's first name */
  public void setFirstName(String newfirstname) {
    firstname = firstname;
  }

  /* Returns the user's permission level */
  public Permission getPermission() {
    return permission;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the error:</p>

<p>I'm following the instructions here:
<a href=""https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/jdo/creatinggettinganddeletingdata"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/jdo/creatinggettinganddeletingdata</a></p>

<p>Specifically, this code in the Making Objects Persistent section</p>

<pre><code>    PersistenceManager pm = PMF.get().getPersistenceManager();

    Employee e = new Employee(""Alfred"", ""Smith"", new Date());

    try {
        pm.makePersistent(e);
    } finally {
        pm.close();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, I don't know where PMF came from.  I'm getting a ""PMF cannot be resolved"" error in Eclipse.</p>

<p>I've looked through other problems on SO to tease out PMF's origin, and found other people do this;
    PersistenceManagerFactory pmf;</p>

<p>But when I try that, I have a problem with get().  Eclipse is saying</p>

<pre><code>The method get() is undefined for the type PersistenceManagerFactory
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone have a complete example of creating a JDO object and persisting it to the datastore, with all the imports and necessary variables?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!!!</p>

<p>Here's my code so far:</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.IOException;
import javax.jdo.PersistenceManager;
import javax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactory;
import javax.servlet.http.*;

        resp.getWriter().println(""Hello, world"");
        PersistenceManagerFactory pmf;
        PersistenceManager pm = pmf.get().getPersistenceManager();
    }
}

<p>There is one thing I don't understand and would like to know how can I do this.</p>

<p>When sender sends money form the bank account (not cc) it's called echeck and it takes up to 5 days.
In some places I can see that people say</p>

<ul>
<li>you can't cancel echeck once it's approved. you can only ask seller to cancel your request/ payment.
but on some other sites I can read</li>
<li>buyer can cancel transfer any time, so do not ship the items untill you get final confirmation.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what's the final answer here, can the buyer cancell the echeck/ transfer or not?
What if they approve it, but after one minute get rid of all the money form the account, and there is nothing they can be charged for?</p>

<p>And the second question: I can see that in the account setting you can disable acceptance od echecks. but how can this be done via API? I mean on my website I will have different sellers and I can't check if they have echeck enabled or not, so I would like to block echecks automatically via api. So, how can I block echecks using API</p>

<p>I have a database with a table <em>Jobs</em>, which contains information about Jobs to be done. I followed the Code First approach of EF 6.0 and create a POCO class called <em>Job</em>. I then query the database for the Jobs:</p>

<pre><code>DbSet&lt;Job&gt; receivedJobs;
using (var context = new MyContext())
{
    receivedJobs = (from j in context.Jobs
            select j);
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the received set <em>receivedJobs</em> I will then do a time consuming optimization.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the lifetime of the context as well as the resources the context controls ends with the closing bracket of the using statement. Also a good design should free resources to the database as soon as it is no longer required.</p>

<p>My question is now what should I do in my case? Just keep the database context alive until I finished my time consuming optimisation task. Or close the connection as it is not needed until the optimisation ends. But in the latter case what do I do with the disposed <em>Job</em> objects, because I will then need to access some navigation properties of them which I can't because the context was closed. (And by the way the data in the instances of the <em>Job</em> class will not be changed by the optimization. So it is not required to keep track of changes to these objects, because there will be none)</p>

<p>Hope someone can help me to understand what is the recommended design in this case.</p>

I've tested the outcome in my layout and I notice the following behaviour when navigating back and forth between views:
-after the animation the page is displayed in its previous scrolling position and it then jumps back to the top.</p>

<p>I've tried to use different timeout combination for creating the new myScoll variable but no luck.</p>

"30903003","1","30903463","","2015-06-17 21:49:24","","3","129","<p>I'm working on a Java application with Swing-based GUI. The application uses <code>JTextPane</code> to output log messages as follows: 1) truncate existing text to keep total text size under the limit; 2) append new text; 3) scroll to the end (actual logic is slightly different, but it's irrelevant here).</p>

<p>I was using Eclipse with JVM Monitor to determine reasonable text size limit and found significant memory leak. I tried to remove <code>UndoableEditListener</code>s from the underlying document and disable automatic caret position updates (by changing the position explicitly with <code>DefaultCaret.NEVER_UPDATE</code> and <code>JTextPane.setCaretPosition(int)</code>), but without success. Finally, I decided to disable changing caret position completely, and this fixed the leak.</p>

<p>I have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there an issue with my code? If yes, how can I change it to accomplish the task?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it a Swing/JVM bug? If yes, how can I report it?</p></li>

<p>I'm not a php developer, i'm a web designer so i use some code from tutorials. The issues is that the code works great in firefox, send the email and works fine but in Google Chrome the form breaks and dont send the email. When click the ""submit"" button the pop up windows open and shown the ""mesage sent"" text, but the email doesn't send.</p>

<p>I've searched arround the web and i've read about a problem between google chrome and PHP ""$_POST"" and ""submit"" but i cant fix the issues.</p>

<p>Any suggestion is welcome or a link to a functionally php form tutorial what works in most browsers (although I read a lot and can not find one that works), is for a job and the time is finish me :) like every time...</p>

<p>Now, if I run something like this:</p>

<pre><code>sortby = ""NAME"" //this gets passed to the function, hence why I am using a variable sortby instead

<p>I get all the strings sorted properly - alphabetically.</p>

<p>However, when ""sortby"" is any of the floating values (RANK or NUM or any other), sort is done again, alphabetically, instead of numerically, so my sorted list looks something like this then:</p>

<p>Now, how can I do a sort like that (most efficiently in terms of speed and resources/computations taken) but have it cast the value somehow to float when it's a float, and leave it as a string when it's a string... possible? And no, removing quotes from float values in the list is not an option - I don't have control over the source list, unfortunately (and I know, that would've been an easy solution).</p>

<p>Is this correct? I am unsure - the Z80 manual is a little unclear on this, as it says that CPDR (a two byte instruction) increments it twice, however the 'Memory Refresh Register' section merely says it increments after each instruction fetch. I have noticed that J80 (an emulator I checked as I'm not sure about this) only increments after the first opcode byte of an instruction.</p>

<p>Which is correct? I guess it is not hugely important in any case, but it would be nice to know :-) Many thanks.</p>

<li>While calling the web service I always need to pass all the arguments irrespective of whether they are optional or not.</li>
<li>I found that in ColdFusion we can omit the optional arguments by adding <code>omit=true</code> in <code>cfinvokeargument</code>. But still we need to add <code>cfinvokeargument</code> for each argument. It doesn't solve much problem.</li>
<li>Since a web service is meant to be accessible from any platform or language, the <code>omit=true</code> hack may not be available in other languages.</li>

<p>After some research here in other similar question's, i find that if I convert UTF-8 code to ESC sequence, like \U00B0 - this must solve that problem, but...

<p>RESULTS METHOD 1
Visual studio shows the ad in the Windows phone project visual xaml view but the Windows phone project does not compile because it can't find a AdRotator.Ads Property</p>

<p>RESULT METHOD 2
Visual studio shows nothing but the app runs and display the ad embeded in the usercontrol, not the one set on the Windows phone project. The AdRotator.Ads setter and OnAdsSourceChanged are never called.</p>

<p>MY SEARCH
I found the subjects :
- <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2237981/bound-property-setter-not-getting-called"">Bound Property Setter not getting Called</a>
- <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5644081/wpf-usercontrol-dependency-property-setter-not-triggering"">WPF UserControl Dependency Property Setter not triggering</a></p>

<p>I can't figure how to make it works. </p>

<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>EDIT: With the modified code, it compiles and calls OnAdsSourceChanged after the constructor's SetValue... But it does not care about the Xaml defined in the Windows phone app project :(</p>

<p>Here's what I do: when i click on a button ""+"", the modal controller appears, we enter a new item, and the table view should be edited, with a new item at the bottom. In the rootViewController, I attach the tableWebsites mutable array to the modal viewcontroller, so we have a copy of the mutable array and we can add the new item at the end of this copy:</p>

<pre><code>ModifViewController *addView = [[ModifViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""ModifViewController"" bundle:nil];  
addView.tabWebSites = self.tabWebSites;  
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, in the rootViewController, we say :  </p>

<pre><code>[self.tableView reloadData];
</code></pre>

<p>So we copied the mutable array in RootView... to be edited in ModifView... but how does the tableview know that the mutable array tableWebsites edited in ModifView...  is the one that should ""fill"" the table view? because we have a tableWebsites in RootView... and another tableWebsites in ModifView... in order to edit it. So i would think that : even if we say ""reloadData"", it will reload the same mutable array in the RootView.</p>

<p>Do you understand what i mean? i'm sorry if it's a mess, i have trouble to make myself clear ;) Thanks for your answer.  </p>

<p>I have more of a 'conceptual' question rather than a purely code-oriented one.</p>

<p>So I have Node.js and Express running on my RPI. I can connect to the board from a computer in the same local area and turn a single LED on and off remotely.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do next is host the web interface on Heroku for example and access the 'functionality' of my RPI from the web rather than from a local connection.</p>

<ul>
<li>How does one go about doing so? Are there any projects which I can
draw inspiration from?  </li>
<li>Should I somehow use web-sockets to establish communication
between the two?</li>
<li>How do I send a 'request' from the server to the RPI, which has a
local IP behind the router?</li>
<li>What is a framework or a set of frameworks that might help me achieve that? (SocketIO?)</li>
</ul>

<p>So... How does the 'internet of things' work really? How do you control a device from the internet and how do you send input from the device to a web interface?</p>

<p>Thanks to anyone who takes the time to reply!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>After changing the class for the <code>UITextView</code> object in the Identity Inspector to <code>PlaceholderTextView</code>, I can set the <code>Placeholder</code> property just fine in the Attribute Inspector. The code works great when running the app, but does not display the placeholder text in the interface builder. I also get the following non-blocking errors (I assume this is why it's not rendering at design time):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>error: IB Designables: Failed to update auto layout status: Interface Builder Cocoa Touch Tool crashed</p>
  
  <p>error: IB Designables: Failed to render instance of PlaceholderTextView: Rendering the view took longer than 200 ms. Your drawing code may suffer from slow performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not able to figure out what is causing these errors. The second error doesn't make any sense, as I'm not even overriding drawRect(). Any ideas?</p>

A video is preloaded on the page and that data can be Liked and posted to Facebook with no issue. When a new thumbnail is clicked, I'd like the Facebook Like information to change to the new video content (title, url, and image).
I've looked for a solution and there are many similar ones but their simple solution of adding <code>FB.XFBML.parse();</code> isn't working for me.
I update my meta tags when the Ajax call comes back successfully using:</p>

<pre><code>$(""meta[property=og\\:title]"").attr('content', videoTitle); 
$(""meta[property=og\\:url]"").attr('content', ""www.mySiteURL.com/index.php?videoID=""+videoID);
$(""meta[property=og\\:image]"").attr('content', ""www.mySiteURL.com/images/video/""+videoImageName);
</code></pre>

<p>But when I run the parse code right after these are set, I see the button refresh but it sill has the same content.
I can see that the meta tags actually update using Firebug.  It's just that the FB button doesn't properly re-scrape the page info to send to FB. I have the namespace set in my html tag and I have the other og:metas set up as well, but these are the three that I need to be re-scraped.</p>

<p>I saw in one post that someone used something similar to <code>ajax.complete(function(){FB.XFBML.parse();});</code> directly on the main page, I don't remember the exact code, but the idea was the same, and it still didn't work.  I figured just running it within my ajax function, on success, would be sufficient.</p>

<p>Am I missing anything?</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Edit:
I should add that each video has its own direct URL that is inserted into the og:url since they are all loaded through ajax. 
The Facebook Linter/Object Debugger shows me all of the correct data for each video when I use one of these unique URLs, it's just a scraping issue - at least, with my limited knowledge on this, that's what it seems to be to me.</p>

<p>At some point JIT compiler attempts to load referenced dlls to satisfy the executing code and causes a ""could not load assembly, access denied"" exception.  Up until this point, I had no need to give the impersonated user local permissions.  That would currently fix the problem.</p>

<p>But I'd rather not add local permissions nor preload assemblies.</p>

<p>Is there a way to have JIT assembly loading happen as the original user?</p>

<p>I wish I could override some JitLoadAssembly method, impersonate my original user and call base.JitLoadAssembly.  Does something like that exist?</p>

<p>Or any other solutions?</p>

<p>EDIT:
I tried to play some games using AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve to then impersonate my original user to handle loading assemblies. But for some reason my AssemblyResolve method is never called when I'm impersonating. I can't find a way to handle AssemblyResolve under impersonation. Any ideas about that?</p>

The creation of the <code>.cspkg</code> and <code>.cscfg</code> files works perfectly using a call to <code>msbuild</code>. Now I'm writing a small .NET console app that should deploy these files to Azure using the Management REST API.</p>

<p>There is no problem concerning the API itself. I can send a request to the API using one of my management certificates. I upload the <code>.cspkg</code> file to Azure BLOB Storage and then try to call <code>Upgrade Deployment</code>. But every time I try, I get a ""400 Bad Request"" response stating that the certificate with thumbprint xy was not found. This certificate is the SSL certificate (<em>not</em> a management certificate) I'm using for HTTPS for my custom domain (DNS CNAME).</p>

<p>And now, the whole thing gets interesting:</p>

<p>When I deploy the files using the ""Publish"" command in my Visual Studio, there is no problem. (I compared the <code>.cscfg</code>/<code>.cspkg</code> files from VS and from my <code>msbuild</code> output: apart from a few GUIDs, they're identical). And furthermore, using the Silverlight Management thingy in my browser, I can even upload my generated files that could not be uploaded using the API.</p>

<p>When I retrieve a list of all certificates using the <code>List Certificates</code> call, the certificate which is said to be missing is apparently there. I can also retrieve its data using the <code>Get Certificate</code> call.</p>

<p>So why does Azure keep telling me that the certificate was not found when using the <code>Upgrade Deployment</code> call? Did anyone experience something similar? Has anyone <strong>the</strong> hint for me? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>P.S.: This is what Azure says when I use the API:</p>

<p>P.P.S.: Yes, the word in the response is <code>certitficate</code>, not <code>certificate</code>.</p>

<p>With the Eclipse-based SDK this was simple and obvious - the test project was a separate project with its own assets folder. With Android Studio this is meant to be something that one configures in build.gradle (or by convention). </p>

<p>Our unit tests are executing, finally, but I've exhausted every suggestion I've found find regarding a custom (and, ideally, merged) assets folder. Here's what I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Adding a test closure to sourceSets within the android closure (by closure I mean that which is between the curly braces in build.gradle).</p>

<pre><code>androidTest {
    assets.srcDirs = ['src/androidTest/assets/']
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Same thing, but with ""test"" as the name of the sourceSet (as opposed to ""androidTest"", above) and also with ""instrumentTest"".</p></li>
<li>Various combinations of above, plus androidTest.setRoot(""test""), androidTest.setRoot(""androidTest""), both of which cause our unit tests to not be recognized (""empty suite"").</li>
</ul>

<p>This question could be more generically stated as ""how does one employ different directories for unit tests in Android Studio"". </p>

<p>We've been over the documentation from Android and either we're not understanding it, it's wrong, or there's a bug somewhere.</p>

<p>Execution of one or more functions during server call depends on which client is calling and what parameters client is passing.</p>

<p>Server performs functionality orchestration internally based on client parameters (usually parameters are type of customer, country, product type etc)</p>

<p>As part of server currently we have set of if/else block to determine this but any change in this requires code changes and release.</p>

<p>I am planning to change this and use very light weight rules engine where I can pass set of parameters and orchestrate functionality by rules (or knockout from there).</p>

<p>Most important requirement is, this rules engine can be configured on the fly (thru some UI) without any code release (like rules stored in cache).</p>

<p>Also, my server takes 10s of millions requests per day and it has to be super fast in terms of response and I cannot afford DB hit or heavy rules engines on every HIT.</p>

<p>One of the idea I had was to introduce feature matrix (using some data structure) and publish it to cache and every server HIT will first check this matrix and determine what needs to be done for this request, I can change feature matrix configuration thru some UI and new configuration will be published to cache ASAP and next server request will use new configuration. </p>

<p>My other ListActivities use a different implementation of ArrayAdapter in order to change the layouts of each row. So in this case I have one XML file containing the ListView and another XML file defining the layout of the row. I need to be able to change the TextView in side the row XML file and the ListView in the other XML file. The reason it is set up this way is to dynamically decide what icon to put in each row and in the implementation of ArrayAdapter I had to use an inflator to get to the label ImageView.

<ul>
<li><p>Rundeck is configured with ssh password less authentication between node Server (rundeck server) and node Target (remote Solaris host)
for user ""master"".</p></li>
<li><p>In node Target I want to execute a script <code>/app/acme/stopApp.sh</code> with user <code>appmanager</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Normally when I need to run the script above I manually proceed with:</p></li>
</ul>

<p><code>ssh master@server</code></p>

<p><code>sudo su - appmanager</code></p>

<p>or simply </p>

<pre><code>ssh -t master@server
sudo su - appmanager
</code></pre>

<p>works without password and finally run (as appmanager)</p>

<p><code>/app/acme/stopApp.sh</code></p>

<p>But I don't know how can I reproduce these steps using Rundeck. I read in some previous 
messages that for each job line rundeck uses a new ssh connection, so the workflow bellow 
always fails for me with the messages:</p>

<p>sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified
Remote command failed with exit status 1</p>

<p>Could someone please help me with this issue?</p>

<p>Without this functionality I wouldn't be able to introduce a little DevOps
in my department. :-D</p>

<p>I read the user guide and admin guide but I couldn't find an easy example,
neither in this forum, to follow.</p>

"24602488","1","","","2014-07-07 03:00:48","","-1","84","<p>I'll note that this is a very <strong>special case</strong>, hence the question to begin with. Under normal circumstances, such a function would be simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have an array named <code>$post_id</code>, which contains <strong>5</strong> values
(Each numerical)</li>
<li>In order to print each value in the array, I use the following loop:</li>
</ol>

<p>.</p>

<pre><code>for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $num; $i++)
            {
        echo $post_id[$i] . '&amp;nbsp;';
            }
</code></pre>

<p>...Which prints the following: <code>49, 48, 47, 46, 43</code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. In my database, I have a table that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>   post_categories
_____________________
 post_id  | category
__________|__________
    43    |  puppies
    43    |   trucks
    46    |   sports
    46    |      rio
    46    | dolphins
    49    |     fifa
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. So, using the data in the array <code>$post_id</code>, I'd like to loop a <strong>database query</strong> to retrieve each value in the <strong>category</strong> column from the <strong>post_categories</strong> table, and place them into uniquely named arrays based on the ""<strong>post id</strong>"", so that something like...</p>

<pre><code>echo $post_id_49[0] . '&amp;nbsp;', $post_id_46[1];
</code></pre>

<p>...Would print ""<strong><code>fifa rio</code></strong>"", assuming you use the above table.</p>

<p>An example of such a query:</p>

<pre><code>//Note - This is ""false"" markup, you'll find out why below

for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $num; $i++)
            {
    $query = ""SELECT category FROM post_categories WHERE post_id = $post_id[$i]"";
    fakeMarkup_executeQuery($query);

            }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Why is this a ""special"" case?</strong> For the same reason the above query is ""false"".</p>

<p>To elaborate, I'm working inside of a software package that doesn't allow for ""normal"" queries so to say, it uses it's own query markup so that the same code can work with multiple database types, leaving it up to the user to specify their database type which leaves the program to interpret the query according to the type of database. It does, however, allow the query to be stored in the same ""form"" that all queries are, like ""<code>$result = *query here*</code>"" (With the only difference being that it executes itself).</p>

<p>For that reason, functions such as <code>mysql_fetch_array</code> (Or any MySQL/MySQLi function akin to that) cannot, and will not work. The software does not provide any form of built in alternatives either, effectively leaving the user to invent their own methods to achieve the same results. I know, pretty lame.</p>

<p>So, this is where I'm stuck. As you'd expect, all and any information you find on the Internet assumes you can use these MySQL &amp; MySQLi functions. <strong>What I need, is an alternative method to grab one array from the results of a looped query per loop.</strong> I simply cannot come to any conclusion that actually works.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> I need to be able to <strong>(1)</strong> loop a query, <strong>(2)</strong> get the output from each loop as it's own array with it's own name, and <strong>(3)</strong>, do so <strong>without</strong> the use of functions like <code>mysql_fetch_array</code>. <strong>The query itself does not actually matter, so don't focus on that. I know what do with the query.</strong></p>

<p>I understand this is horrifically confusing, long, and complicated. I've been trudging through this mess for days - Close to the point of ""cheating"" and storing the data I'm trying to get here as raw code in the database. Bad practice, but sure as heck a lot easier on my aching mind.</p>

<p>I salute any brave soul who attempts to unravel this mess, good luck. If this is genuinely impossible, let me know so that I can send the software devs an angry letter. All I can guess is that they never considered that a case like mine would come up. Maybe this is much more simple then I make it to be, but regardless, I personally cannot come to an logical conclusion.</p>

For the sake of my own sanity, I'm going to take a break after posting, so I may not be able to answer any follow up questions right away.

<p>The JSON object is used as the <code>ng-model</code> of an element in AngularJS. Now I want to bind the <code>completionPercent</code> as the width of an element in AngularJS. But CSS <code>width</code> expects a String like <code>'42%'</code>, not a Number. So the following <strong>does not work</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""progressBackground"" ... &gt;

<p>The w flag is supposed to make it so an end-of-paragraph occurs when a line ends in a non-blank character, rather than at first blank line (which is Vim default).  Here is snippet from the help docs:</p>

<pre><code>w   Trailing white space indicates a paragraph continues in the next line.
    A line that ends in a non-white character ends a paragraph.
</code></pre>

<p>The a flag makes reformatting automatic, as you type.  For example, in document with text below and w and a flags the lines reformat as I type only up to the 'last line in paragraph' and not below.</p>

<pre><code>This it the first line of the paragraph. &lt;cr&gt;
The text in it reformats properly as I type &lt;cr&gt;
up to the last line of the paragraph, which is &lt;cr&gt;
right after this line, that is, just below here: &lt;cr&gt;
This is the last line of paragraph.&lt;cr&gt;
This is the first line of second paragraph. &lt;cr&gt;
Even though there is no blank line between &lt;cr&gt;
it and first paragraph, any reformatting of &lt;cr&gt;
the first paragraph ends at the last line &lt;cr&gt;
of first paragraph.&lt;cr&gt;
&lt;cr&gt;
This the the first line after second paragraph&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Now to my question:</strong>
With <code>a</code> and <code>w</code> flags the reformatting works properly as I type in the first paragraph, i.e, second paragraph remains untouched.  But sometimes I want to select the current paragraph using <code>vap</code>.  It seems to me that with the <code>w</code> flag set this should select only the first paragraph.  But in fact issuing <code>vap</code> in first paragraph selects the second paragraph also, all the way down to the blank line with <code>&lt;cr&gt;</code>, seemingly ignoring the <code>w</code> formatoptions flag.</p>

<p>Is this expected behavior?  Am I missing something?  Why does <code>vap</code> not select only the paragraph I'm in, which ends at first line with no trailing whitespace?</p>

<p>That's good. So I created a class <code>RemoteImage</code>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>public class RemoteImageView extends RelativeLayout {

    public RemoteImageView(Context context) {

    }

    public void init(RelativeLayout.LayoutParams layoutParams) {
        LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater)getContext().getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
        inflater.inflate(R.layout.remote_image_view, this);
        setLayoutParams(layoutParams);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And there a wild question appears.
I cannot write code as below:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>RemoteImageView rm1 = (RemoteImageView)findViewById(R.id.imageView1);
</code></pre>

<p>Because I'll get exception:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.ClassCastException: android.widget.RelativeLayout cannot be cast to com.dmact.remoteimage.RemoteImageView
</code></pre>

<p>So I should create an instance of <code>RemoteImageView</code> dynamically and then apply some <code>LayoutParams</code> to it. Is there a way not to do this? I want to make the layout in XML, not in code.</p>

<p>What I do now:</p>

<pre><code>var myObject = function() {
    this.observableSequence = new Rx.Subject();
};

myObject.prototype.connect = function(somePromise) {
    var self = this;
    somePromise.done(function(anotherSequence) {

            self.observableSequence.onNext(element);
        });
    });
};
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example (which works as it is), I basically wait for an external promise (passed by a library consumer that is out of my control) to resolve and then start piping elements from one observable sequence into another sequence.</p>

<p>I think I am doing something wrong here because of the much overhead code. The only reason I used the <code>Rx.Subject</code> is to allow other external subscribers to subscribe to the <code>observableSequence</code> prior the completion of the promise. But for my API consumers, I want the details of the .connect() method to be hidden. The consumer shoud just see the <code>observableSequence</code> member and be able to subscribe at any time to it.</p>

<p>I'd rather have a solution without the <code>Rx.Subject</code> (as some suggest Rx.Subject shouldn't be used as it is a mutable) and am also wondering if there is a better way to perform the 'piping' between the to observable sequences.</p>

<p>Also, while my stop watch is running, I would like it to display the current time elapsed every second.  To do this I plan to use a TimerTask and schedule it to report the time (converted to seconds) every second.

<p>Note how the top listing has a p: reload proxy configuration.</p>

<p>The only difference between the 2 is that at the second run internet explorer has been opened which is had not been in the first run.</p>

<p>So it is possible to run the java applet, but it runs in 2 different modes. I believe that the error we end up with is related to trying to run javascript, possibly the mode that our applet runs in does not have permission to run scripting.</p>

<p>The issue applies to JRE 1.6+</p>

<p>Any help in resolving this issue will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Say my app has been sent a program (in some script language) and I want my app to run that script. That script could come from an openly hostile individual, but I want to run it anyway. (Like JavaScript in a browser.)</p>

<pre><code>var sc = new SecureScript(""SomeFileFromAnUnknownPossiblyHostileSource.xyz"");
/* Set some event handlers. */
sc.Run();
</code></pre>

<p>During the <em>Run</em> call, the script could construct it's own data, mess around with simple data types, do whatever it wants as long the effects are contained within it's own world.</p>

<p>If the script attempts to OpenFile(""C:/WINDOWS/SOMETHING.EXE""), that will fail, because I haven't registered an OpenFile function. The only way the script could interact with the outside world is by using a function I've especially registered for use by the script. By doing that, I'm taking responsibility that the script can't do anything bad with it. Sure, I could neglect to validate the parameters, but that's not the interpreter's job.</p>

<p>If a script allocated too much memory, or take too many CPU cycles, the interpreter class would invoke my event handler once a threshold has been passed and give me the power to stop the script dead.</p>

<p>I'm more interested in the interpreter being secure rather than fast. Javascript JIT compilers are all very nice, but I hear of browsers being updated due to a vulnerability a bit too often for my liking.</p>

<p>So, there's my plea. Maybe this already exists or I need to build it myself. I'd prefer a .NET/Mono library but I am open to other platforms.</p>

<p>So when removing items I had an entity bean that went something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Stateless
@Local(DeleteBookAuthor.class)
public class DeleteBookAuthorBean implements DeleteBookAuthor
{

   @PersistenceContext(unitName=""Library"")
   protected EntityManager em;

   @Override
   public void removeById(Integer id) {
      try{

        Query q = em.createQuery(""SELECT ba FROM BookAuthor ba WHERE id = ?1"");
        q.setParameter(1,id);

        BookAuthor ba = (BookAuthor) q.getSingleResult();

        ba.getAuthor().getBookAuthors().remove(ba);
        ba.getBook().getBookAuthors().remove(ba);

        em.remove(ba);
      }catch (Exception e){
         e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunatelly, when my Servlet calls this bean it returns a ""deleted entity passed to persist"" exception; However changing the lines:</p>

<pre><code>Query q = em.createQuery(""SELECT ba FROM BookAuthor ba WHERE id = ?1"");
q.setParameter(1,id);        
BookAuthor ba = (BookAuthor) q.getSingleResult(); 
</code></pre>

<p>to </p>

<pre><code>BookAuthor ba = em.find(BookAuthor.class, id)
</code></pre>

<p>makes the problem go away. The question I ask is why? In a similar situation I used <code>em.createQuery</code> to retrieve and delete muliple entities and it worked without a hitch. So why won't it work now?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Calling 
<code>Query q=...</code> and then removing the BookAuthors removes the <code>BookAuthors</code> from <code>Books</code> but not from the <code>Authors</code>. In second case it is removed from both sets. Both <code>ba</code> have same hash and return <code>true</code> when compared using <code>baQuery.equals(baFind)</code> .</p>

<p>Any clarifications why two functions would return same object but calling <code>remove</code> would behave differently depending on whether <code>query</code>/<code>find</code> is called?</p>

<p>It works well except that the size of the banner. </p>

<p>In portrait(detail width 768), the banner's width is fit(length 768), but in landscape(detail width 703), the banner's width is still 768, so some contents of the iAd is missing.</p>

<p>I add some constraints to the Ad BannerView, but it seems they don't work at all.</p>

<p>I also try this:</p>

<pre><code>[self.ad setAutoresizingMask:UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth];
</code></pre>

<p>It still does't change the size in landscape.</p>

<p>So, what can I do to fit the Ad BannerView's size in both portrait and landscape?
Thanks a lot!!</p>

<p>I want to explore my options for changing or replacing them with a <code>uniqeidentifier</code>(GUID).<br>
Is it feasible to insert a NEW PK column?<br>
Would I be better of just increasing it to a <code>big int</code>?</p>

<p>Anything else I should consider?</p>

<hr>

<p>To elaborate on WHY I want to do do this:</p>

<p>It is my understanding that when Replication encounters an IDENTITY Column it sets aside an Identity Range, say 1-1000(default), for each subscriber to ensure an Unique INT for that column.  The more subscribers you have the bigger issue it can become.  This leads to the Identity Range Check Constraint errors we keep getting.  </p>

<p>In my mind after hasAnyAuthority(""USER""), should have a .permitAll(). But dont.</p>

<p>So, the freerest path works fine, but if I try some user, which is on my database, or the default Spring's user I get 403.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>client (Angular) --&gt; proxy (Express + restler) --&gt; API (RestEasy)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>RestEasy API performs a long-running query and hands the results back down the chain.</p>

<p>At any time, either SPA client or proxy server can cancel their requests - SPA app might navigate to another page or simply be closed, proxy server might be restarted (e.g. during the dev process).</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the Java app server essentially crashes and starts returning 500 (Invalid Request) to every response made to it. We've determined that the problem is on the Java app side, as only restarting the Java app solves the issue. My understanding is that the Java service gets stuck trying to send the response to a failed connection.</p>

<p>I've several questions regarding this scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>In general, is there a provision in HTTP protocol to deal with (established) connection failure?</li>
<li>Is there a ""clean"" way to abort the connection from the client?
<ul>
<li>From the Angular app (http promise cancellation?)</li>
<li>From the proxy server (restler)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is there a way to determine aborted client connection from the server?</li>
<li>Can the server cancel the long-running queue if the client bailed out in the middle of it?</li>
</ol>

What is the correct way of accessing attribute data from inherited classes.</p>

<p>Assuming 3 classes:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Vehicle
{
  public int Id {get; set; }    
  public int Wheels {get; set; }
  public string Name {get; set; }
  public string Color {get; set; }
 }
 public class Car : Vehicle
 {
 }
 public class Truck : Vehicle
 {
  public int LoadCapacity {get; set; }  
 }
</code></pre>

<p>My first thought was to create a repository of some kind that gives me the attributes of whatever I'm looking for.</p>

<p>There are 2 types of queries as I see it that I will need:</p>

<ol>
<li>Return attributes of vehicle with a specific ID </li>
<li>Give me all vehiclesof a specific type</li>
</ol>

<p>So:</p>

<pre><code>public class VehicleRepository
{
    ICollection &lt;???&gt; _vehicles;

    ??? GetVehicle(int Id);
    ??? GetVehicles(??? vehicleType);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The ??? are my unknowns.</p>

<p>My thought was to add something like an interface for IVehicle and implement Vehicle with it.
The result would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>public class VehicleRepository
{
    ICollection &lt;IVehicle&gt; _vehicles;

    IVehicle GetVehicle(int Id);
    ICollection &lt;IVehicle&gt; GetVehicles(IVehicle vehicleType);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This obviously doesnt work.</p>

<pre><code>public IVehicle GetVehicle(int Id)
{
    return _vehicles.First(x=&gt;x.Id == Id);
    // The above want compile as the interface has no attributes
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I use Vehicle instead of IVehicle, the 'First(x=>x.Id == Id)' will work fine but it will not return 'LoadCapacity' if the vehicle is a truck.</p>

<p>Looking at the GetVehicles function, I was thinking something like:</p>

<pre><code>public ICollection &lt;T&gt; GetVehicles &lt;T&gt; ()
{
    var vehicles = _vehicles.Where(???);
    return vehicles;
}
</code></pre>

<p>A bit lost on what should go in there BUT I would like to avoid reflection and just reading assemblies and class types, etc.</p>

<p>Thanks for any advice.</p>

On my development machine when I access url <code>http:\\local-iis\holidays</code> application is loaded correctly and displayed.<br>
But on 3 others computers in the same network I get error, because browser can't find that js file.</p>

<p>It's my first project in MVC 4 and I don't know how should I configure my application to get those urls working.</p>

<p>I don't know why my application is removing that directory name (it is referring to root of my local-iis server)</p>

Because they don't leave the screen I assume they should not get wiped, but one of the cells does not seem to keep it's variable, which makes me think maybe it's getting wiped and I may need to move the state outside of the cells to a dictionary or something and in <strong>didSelectItemAtIndexPath</strong> instead of setting the variable in the cell I'd set the dictionary.  Whenever I need to access the data instead of asking the cell for it I'd look it up in the dictionary.</p>

Mind you I do not need any worked-out code but just the information on how I could do this using free tools.

I would like to take a backup (package snapshot) into a test environment, and then migrate this to production once development is complete (I certainly don't want to do development on the production system!).  The problem is that the snapshot also backs up all data so uploading the new package over the top of the existing package in the sharepoint app repository reverts the data to the time of snapshot as well.  Alternatively, rolling back to the original snapshot if there are issues would lose all data after the new package was applied.</p>

<p>I can easily get a second version of the app going by saving as a new application etc but this creates a new product ID etc in the app store.  We also use a Access 2013 desktop accdb frontend to hook directly into the Azure SQL database to do all the stuff that the web app can't provide (formatted reports etc) so I cant just create a new app every time without dealing with all of the credential and database renaming issues.</p>

<p>So my question is, does anybody know how to safely operate a test environment for Access 2013 web app development?  One needs to be able to apply an updated version, or rollback to the old one if there are problems without rolling back the data.  With the desktop client I can just save a new copy of the accdb file every time obviously.  I dont mind creating a new instance or link to the app on sharepoint each time, however this obviously generates a totally new database (server name, db location, login id's etc) as well.  You would hope there is a way to upload and replace your app without touching the data, else how else can you develop without working directly in production?</p>

<p>Any answers would be really appreciated.</p>

 B moves over A, then after pressing back
 A moves over B.</pre>

<p>The first part works well (list>detail) however I hook the opposite order of effects on the back action and it kind of works but not as I would want it. The wrong page (page B) undertakes the slide after back press, settles over A, then disappears.</p>

<p>What I really wanted was for A to slide over B after back press, which makes more sense.</p>

<p>Code from list:</p>

<pre><code>lstBooks.setOnItemClickListener(new ListView.OnItemClickListener()
{
    @Override
    public void onItemClick(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; adapter, View view, int position, long id)
    {
        Intent intent = new Intent(BooksActivity.this, DetailClass.class);
        startActivity(intent);
        overridePendingTransition(R.anim.left_to_right_slide, R.anim.right_to_left_slide);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The opposite from the detail page :</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onBackPressed()
{
    super.onBackPressed();
    overridePendingTransition(R.anim.left_to_right_slide,  R.anim.right_to_left_slide);
}
</code></pre>

<p>left to right slide:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;

&lt;set xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"" android:shareInterpolator=""false""&gt;
    &lt;translate android:fromXDelta=""-100%""

NET Identity 2.1</a></p>

<p>This works perfectly in my controllers, but not when I try to create a token by calling localhost:xxxx/token on my API. Below is the method called, however the <code>context.OwinContext.GetUserManager</code> returns null.</p>

<p>I have tried injecting the <code>ApplicationUserManager</code> into the <code>ApplicationOAuthProvider</code>, but was not able to successfully. Can you please point me in the right direction?</p>

<p>Edit: 10/15</p>

<p>Okay, so I have gotten a bit further, but I am still stuck.I was able to initialize the classes with the following:</p>

<pre><code>        var x = new DatabaseContext();
        var store = new UserStore&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;(x);
        var options = new IdentityFactoryOptions&lt;ApplicationUserManager&gt;()
        {
            DataProtectionProvider = new Microsoft.Owin.Security.DataProtection.DpapiDataProtectionProvider(""ApplicationName"")
        };

        builder.Register&lt;DatabaseContext&gt;(c =&gt; x);
        builder.Register&lt;UserStore&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;&gt;(c =&gt; store).AsImplementedInterfaces();
        builder.Register&lt;IdentityFactoryOptions&lt;ApplicationUserManager&gt;&gt;(c =&gt; options);
        builder.RegisterType&lt;ApplicationUserManager&gt;();

        builder.Register&lt;ApplicationOAuthProvider&gt;(c =&gt; new ApplicationOAuthProvider(""self"", new ApplicationUserManager(store, options))).As&lt;IOAuthAuthorizationServerProvider&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>This allowed me to pass the <code>ApplicationUserManager</code> into my <code>ApplicationOAuthProvider</code>'s constructor. In the <code>Startup.Auth</code> configuration, I initialize the Provider with the following:</p>

<pre><code>OAuthOptions = new OAuthAuthorizationServerOptions
        {
            TokenEndpointPath = new PathString(""/Token""),
            Provider = (IOAuthAuthorizationServerProvider)GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.DependencyResolver.GetService(typeof(IOAuthAuthorizationServerProvider)),
            AuthorizeEndpointPath = new PathString(""/api/Account/ExternalLogin""),
            AccessTokenExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromDays(14),
            AllowInsecureHttp = true
        };
</code></pre>

<p>This gets me closer to a solution, but still has two problems. </p>

<p>The first is when I call /token on the API the <code>userManager.FindAsync(context.UserName, context.Password)</code> returns a null value, but <code>userManager.FindByEmailAsync(context.UserName)</code> returns the correct user. My initial thought is the password is wrong,but I made sure it was the same password I registered with.</p>

<p>The second issue, is if I call register on my AccountController, and then call /token, I get a <strong>Cannot access a disposed object.Object name: 'UserStore'</strong> error. So I assume this means I am not initializing the <code>ApplicationOAuthProvider</code> correctly in my Bootstrapper file.</p>

<p>Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>I've commented out the line that prints the output. If I uncomment that line, then I call the class thus:</p>

<p>it prints out just fine.</p>

<p>However, if I leave it as it is, and call it thus:</p>

<pre><code>$output = new sql_output_two_rows(""select * from cameron.accounts limit 10"");

print $output . ""\n"";

<p>then I get the following error:</p>

<p>To overcome this, I have to add this functionality to the class:</p>

}

<p>My question is this: What is happening to make the one work - ie when I print from the class - and the other not - ie when I return the output.</p>

<pre><code>{""data"":

     ...
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, I am using <code>#&gt;&gt;</code> operator with dynamically generated condition:</p>

<p>1) Calculate number of elements in <code>data</code> array</p>

<p>2) Create varchar array condition to match every ""row""</p>

<p>3) Process elements on individual rows.</p>

<p>My solution is:</p>

<pre><code>select 
  json_row,
  json_row#&gt;&gt;'{stamp}' as stamp,
  json_row#&gt;&gt;'{date}' as date,  
  json_row#&gt;&gt;'{img,0}' as img,

  json_row#&gt;&gt;'{img,1,1}' as img_height,      
  json_row#&gt;&gt;'{thumb,0}' as thumb,
  json_row#&gt;&gt;'{thumb,1,0}' as thumb_width,  
  json_row#&gt;&gt;'{thumb,1,1}' as thumb_height,
  json_row#&gt;&gt;'{thumb,2,0}' as th_x1,

</code></pre>

<p>This works and I can live with it. But, given that this is my first exercise with JSON in PostgreSQL I would like to ask if there is better way to map similar JSON structure to rows. I think that I am supposed to use <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-json.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>json_populate_recordset</code></a>, but did not succeed so far.</p>

<p>SQLFiddle does not work currently, sample data:</p>

create table gallery_json(gjson json);

insert into gallery_json (gjson) 
  select '{""data"":[

<p>I've inherited a C# wed application due to someone leaving at work and me being the only one with bandwidth! But not the .Net, C# knowledge!</p>

<p>The app is used by people on different sites all over the world. They log in using the corporate login details and as such they log into different servers depending on where they are located, (Europe, America or India).</p>

<p>The guy who wrote the app couldn't work out how to switch the ConnectionString in web.config depending on location, so duplicated the whole app for each domain! With the only variation being a single IP address in  web.config for each duplicated version of the app!  Then did a simple web front page which took the user to ""their"" version of the app depending on where they said they were in the world!</p>

<p>The first thing I want to do is to move to a single version to maintain, so I need to be able to switch the connection string or how to login? </p>

<p>I've spent several days trying to work out how I get to ConnectionString (defined in web.config) from my Login class, only to discover the values set in web.config seem to be read only, so I can't alter them.</p>

<p>So I guess the first question is, am I barking up the wrong tree? Can I just set all the information that AspNetActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider (see code later) requires and call it from my login class? Or is the ConnectionString route the Ipso facto way to set up connections in .Net/C#? So therefor I do need to find out how to change/specify/add the value at runtime.</p>

<p>Three possibilities I can think of:- (The first is the one I've ground to a hult with)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change the ConnectionString for ADService in my web.config from my Login class?</p></li>
<li><p>Change what AspNetActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider uses, so from my Login class magicly get it to use EMEA_ADService or PACIFIC_ADService as defined in web.config?</p></li>
<li>Is it possible to define a new connectionString and call AspNetActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider all from my Login class, not using web.config for this connection at all?</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a bit of my/his web.config file and my Login class</p>

<p><strong>Cuttings from Web.config</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;
    &lt;add name=""ADService"" connectionString=""LDAP://12.345.67.8"" /&gt;          *---- Original ConnectionString (IP address changed)----* 
    &lt;add name=""EMEA_ADService"" connectionString=""LDAP://12.345.67.8"" /&gt;     *---- Added by me playing around unsuccessfully! ----* 
    &lt;add name=""PACIFIC_ADService"" connectionString=""LDAP://12.345.67.9"" /&gt;  *---- Added by me playing around unsuccessfully! ----*

      &lt;/providers&gt;
    &lt;/membership&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is as far as I've got in my class before finding out that I don't appear to be able to alter ConnectionString!</p>

<p><strong>Cuttings from Login.aspx.cs</strong></p>

<pre><code>public partial class Login : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
         ConnectionStringSettingsCollection connections = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings; //this is now working :)
        string userDomain = Environment.UserDomainName;  //Probably don't need this, it seems to give the login domain on the machine. Don't know yet if that will be the users machine or the server the app runs on?
        if (connections.Count != 0)
        {
            foreach (ConnectionStringSettings connection in connections)
            {
                string testname = connections[""ADService""].Name;
                string testConnectionString = connections[""ADService""].ConnectionString;
                connections[""ADService""].ConnectionString = ""LDAP://12.345.67.9"";
                testConnectionString = connections[""ADService""].ConnectionString;

<p>So here is what I do :</p>

<pre><code>$("".div2"").show().toggleClass(""shown"");

<p>But the animation does not work, it just appears instantly. I thought that it was because the .show() wasn't finished yet when I trigger toggleClass. So, as a ""duration"" method, it must support .delay.</p>

<p>Now, if I delay the toggleClass :</p>

<pre><code>$("".div2"").show().delay(100).toggleClass(""shown"");

<p>Still does not work.
Let's try a setTimeout:</p>

<pre><code>$("".div2"").show(); 
setTimeout(function(){$("".div2"").toggleClass(""shown"")}, 1);
</code></pre>

<p>This one works. So it appears that show() is indeed a long operation, but it does not support the delay() method. So I wanted to try using its callback :</p>

<pre><code>$("".div2"").show(function(){$("".div2"").toggleClass(""shown"")});
</code></pre>

<p>And this works, without setTimeout ! But the callback gets called twice (once at the beginning, once 400ms after).
What should I use to do that properly ?</p>

My teacher told me to use div classes so that my css code will be reduced but here are the problems. I have div class for images and they are supposed to be next to each other in a same row. I have another 3 div class boxes for text which should be below divs with images, and also I have 2 background images one of them should be on left hand side and other one on right so it creates a flag of Italy. I have tried everything I can thing of but I still cannot make it work properly can anyone help?</p>

<p>First time here so I don't know how to post the code correctly so I will just attach a file with the code please forgive me.</p>

My slideshow works as it should but the width is a huge issue. 
The width doesn't adapt to the screen, it just takes the width of the image (maximum) and shows it. My big monitor shows everything without problem because the images are incidently as wide as that one, but my smaller monitor shows a horizontal scroll bar and the image doesn't resize.</p>

<p>Is there a specific fix for this or should I try and fix it manually? 
Like, add the detect option on scroll and on page load for $(document).width() to be added to the slideshow. or perhaps a better way? Please help me, I tried everything I thought of so far. New ideas would be welcome. Thank you</p>

<p>What's going on there? What's with the [ERROR] blocks? It doesnt seem like there are any errors at all?</p>

<p>Additionally, I get the following warning, which I dont entirely understand</p>

<p>And finally, how come all the dependencies are added to the datanucleus enchancer classpath? 
There's a [INFO] message from datanucleus enhancer listing all the jars in its classpath and it seem to contain everything, how come? I would have thought only the JDO and persistence related libraries was needed there?</p>

<pre><code>SELECT l.listing_id as l_listing_id, ld.*
FROM listings as l
JOIN listing_documents AS ld ON ld.listing_id = LPAD(l.listing_id, 6, '0')
ORDER BY l_listing_id
</code></pre>

<p>But its only showing the listing_id from listing table. I want to join both the tables so both tables data should come in a single table. So can someone tell me how to do this? </p>

@page = 1

<p>Correct value must be like: key: <strong>books:4:1</strong> and values <strong>n:{""data1"":""data1_value"" , ""data2"":""data2_value"", ""data3"":""data3_value""}</strong>, where <strong>""n""</strong> is index from 0 .. total found books.</p>

<p>Sometimes I can see in key <strong>books:4:1</strong> value like <strong>0:{""total"":""1468""}</strong></p>

<p>All keys are unique in my code for redis and parameter ""total"" I use only in SQL query (select count(*) as total from books) executable by mysql2 in other sinatra url handler method - never with redis cache.</p>

For each value in my array I need to find the kth (where k = 81) nearest neighbours </p>

<p>I then do some further code based on that..</p>

<p><em>[in brief, I'm effectively trying to extend the SSIM algorithm but for a picture sitting in 4D - I have a list of values with len(my_values)=1,000,000 = len(my_coords).
Although as an added complication my 'picture' is not made of points in a simple grid, but is more like a collection of 1,000,000 'point-stars' distributed psudo-randomly in 4D space - that for difference sets of 'my_values' have difference brightnesses, but always the same location...
That context may not be needed :) ].</em></p>

<p>Roughly I need to do:</p>

<pre><code>from scipy.spatial import KDTree 
mytree = KDTree(my_coords)
for i in range(len(my_coords)):
    dist, locs = mytree.query(my_coords[i], k=k)
    ....
    result.append(some_function(dist,locs,my_values_pic1[locs],my_values_pic2[locs]))

<p>I tried querying mytree with the full 'my_coords' but this caused a memory problem. - also obviously that for loop takes forever.... so needs to be optomized.</p>

<p>I'm trying to change my loop to do chunks of about 300 points at a time and then stiching together the result -  I'm just wondering if I'm missing something obvious that could make this even faster?</p>

On the wesite, i am getting username and password to login and display the information page.</p>

<p>Its ok that after login on the website i am getting other page, but to display the data of that info page in iphone i have to convert them into json format. My question is how can i achieve this, like on website i should get info page and on the iphone , i should get json array of the values on info page.</p>

<p>If i echo in php the json array, it will simply dump it on the website page along with other details on webpage. I was thinking that anyhow i can make use of UserID here after login and on the basis of that UserID i can get details of other webpages if i add more webpages. Username and Password will just be used for login purpose, returning UserID and later data will be accessed using that UserID.

I've just about finished (everything is functionally fine right now) but as I've gone through the development, I've been using a static string definition as opposed to entering the input each time.</p>

<p>Here is an example input.
ex1 = ""C1,8R1+4;R3-4C2C7+4;R5R2-3C1-6+3;R2-3C6+2;""</p>

<p>The last thing I need to do is handle user input (the input should come from standard in, not some definition).
Not only do I not know how to get input for sure, but I'm beginning to think I'm royally screwed because of the nature of haskell. I mean, it seems like the entire language is just nested statements within nested statements with recursive nested statements and so on and so forth. It's a confusing mess to me. I'm not even sure what to ask... so far my attempts at getting user input have meant that I need to start throwing around the input as a parameter to every single function in the entire program just to get it to compile.
Is there any way I can turn user input into a definition like the above? Or perhaps even just cheat with a global string variable? I'm desperate :( Thanks.</p>

<p>I know it's probably bad to be posting my entire program but I feel like I need to so I can show how intertwined it all is, making it difficult to figure out how to proceed.</p>

<p>IP Header is already filled out (stored in the DATAGRAM array). I'm using the PHEADER array for TCP checksum calculation. I'm basically filling it with exactly the same values I've filled the actual packet. The packet I send comes out fine (accordingly to Wireshark I'm using), except for the  TCP checksum value. Above is the code used for calculating it. What's the error?</p>

<p><strong>What's the easiest way of encoding and decoding such an object graph to and from NSData?</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>How i tried to solve it:</em></strong> I stored each RGB pixel value in a 2D array (<code>a[][]</code> also called the big array). I Stored the button pixels/smaller 2Darray in the <code>optionArrayButton[][]</code>.
Then coded these steps: (Look at the arrays below while reading this).</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the number for <code>SmallerArray[0][0] = firstSmallerArray</code> Number</li>
<li>Check Biger Array for <code>FirstSmallerArray</code> number by going through <code>[0][0]</code> to <code>[0][end]</code> then <code>[1][0]</code> to <code>[1][end]</code> and so on.</li>
<li>If <code>firstSmallerArray</code> number is not found return <code>-1</code> or <code>not Found</code>.</li>
<li>Else Get position of where it is found in the bigger Array.</li>
<li>Get the height of Smaller Array (<code>smallerArray.length</code>) and width (<code>smallerArray[0].length</code>).</li>
<li>Using <code>firstSmallerArray</code> number, <code>smallerArray.length</code>, and <code>smallerArray[0].length</code> store in temp array.</li>
<li>check if the <code>temp == smallerArray</code> and get coordinates.</li>
</ol>

<p><em><strong>What i need help with:</em></strong> for some reason even though the smaller array is inside the larger array it says button is not found (foundButton returns false). I have spent two days on it and couldn't find whats wrong.</p>

It redefines the <code>Parser</code> type, so how do you use the token parser functions exported by Parsec's <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/parsec/3.1.3/doc/html/Text-Parsec-Token.html""><code>Text.Parsec.Token</code></a> module, which are of the normal <code>Parser</code> type?</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/parsec/latest/doc/html/Text-Parsec.html"">Parsec</a> is a parser combinator library, whatever that means.</li>
<li><a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/IndentParser-0.2.1"">IndentParser 0.2.1</a> is an old package providing the two modules <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/IndentParser/0.2.1/doc/html/Text-ParserCombinators-Parsec-IndentParser.html""><code>Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.IndentParser</code></a> and <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/IndentParser/0.2.1/doc/html/Text-ParserCombinators-Parsec-IndentParser-Token.html""><code>Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.IndentParser.Token</code></a></li>
<li><a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/indents-0.3.3"">indents 0.3.3</a> is a new package providing the single module <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/indents/0.3.3/doc/html/Text-Parsec-Indent.html""><code>Text.Parsec.Indent</code></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Parsec comes with <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/parsec/latest/doc/html/Text-Parsec.html"">a load of modules</a>. most of them export a bunch of useful parsers (e.g. <code>newline</code> from <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/parsec/3.1.3/doc/html/Text-Parsec-Char.html#v%3anewline""><code>Text.Parsec.Char</code></a>, which parses a newline) or parser combinators (e.g.  <code>count n p</code> from <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/parsec/3.1.3/doc/html/Text-Parsec-Combinator.html#v%3acount""><code>Text.Parsec.Combinator</code></a>, which runs the parser <em>p</em>, <em>n</em> times)</p>

<p>However, the module <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/parsec/3.1.3/doc/html/Text-Parsec-Token.html""><code>Text.Parsec.Token</code></a> would like to export functions which are parametrized by the user with features of the language being parsed, so that, for example, the <code>braces p</code> function will run the parser <em>p</em> after parsing a '{' and before parsing a '}', ignoring things like comments, the syntax of which depends on your language.</p>

<p>The way that <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/parsec/3.1.3/doc/html/Text-Parsec-Token.html""><code>Text.Parsec.Token</code></a> achieves this is that it exports a single function <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/parsec/3.1.3/doc/html/Text-Parsec-Token.html#v%3amakeTokenParser""><code>makeTokenParser</code></a>, which you call, giving it the parameters of your specific language (like what a comment looks like) and it returns a record containing all of the functions in <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/parsec/3.1.3/doc/html/Text-Parsec-Token.html""><code>Text.Parsec.Token</code></a>, adapted to your language as specified.</p>

<p>Of course, in an indentation-style language, these would need to be adapted further (perhaps? here's where I'm not sure – I'll explain in a moment) so I note that <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/IndentParser-0.2.1"">the (presumably obsolete) IndentParser package</a> provides a module <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/IndentParser/0.2.1/doc/html/Text-ParserCombinators-Parsec-IndentParser-Token.html""><code>Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.IndentParser.Token</code></a> which looks to be a drop-in replacement for <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/parsec/3.1.3/doc/html/Text-Parsec-Token.html""><code>Text.Parsec.Token</code></a>.</p>

<p>I should mention at some point that all the Parsec parsers are monadic functions, so they do magic things with state so that error messages can say at what line and column in the source file the error appeared</p>

<h1>My Problem</h1>

<p>For a couple of small reasons it appears to me that <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/indents-0.3.3"">the indents package</a> is more-or-less the current version of IndentParser, however it does not provide a module that looks like <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/IndentParser/0.2.1/doc/html/Text-ParserCombinators-Parsec-IndentParser-Token.html""><code>Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.IndentParser.Token</code></a>, it only provides <code>Text.Parsec.Indent</code>, so <strong>I am wondering how one goes about getting all the token parsers from <code>Text.Parsec.Token</code></strong> (like <code>reserved ""something""</code> which parses the reserved keyword ""something"", or like <code>braces</code> which I mentioned earlier).</p>

<p>It would appear to me that (the new) <code>Text.Parsec.Indent</code> works by some sort of monadic state magic to work out at what column bits of source code are, so that it doesn't need to modify the token parsers like <code>whiteSpace</code> from <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/parsec/3.1.3/doc/html/Text-Parsec-Token.html#v%3awhiteSpace""><code>Text.Parsec.Token</code></a>, which is probably why it doesn't provide a replacement module. But I am having a problem with types.</p>

<p>You see, without <code>Text.Parsec.Indent</code>, all my parsers are of type <code>Parser Something</code> where Something is the return type and <code>Parser</code> is a type alias defined in Text.Parsec.String as</p>

<pre><code>type Parser = Parsec String ()
</code></pre>

<p>but with <code>Text.Parsec.Indent</code>, instead of importing <code>Text.Parsec.String</code>, I use my own definition</p>

<pre><code>type Parser a = IndentParser String () a
</code></pre>

<p>which makes all my parsers of type <code>IndentParser String () <em>Something</em></code>, where IndentParser is defined in Text.Parsec.Indent. but the token parsers that I'm getting from <code>makeTokenParser</code> in <code>Text.Parsec.Token</code> are of the wrong type.</p>

<p>If this isn't making much sense by now, it's because I'm a bit lost. The type issue is <a href=""http://spin.atomicobject.com/2012/03/16/using-text-parsec-indent-to-parse-an-indentation-sensitive-language-with-haskells-parsec-library/"">discussed a bit here</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>The error I'm getting is that I've tried replacing the one definition of <code>Parser</code> above with the other, but then when I try to use one of the token parsers from <code>Text.Parsec.Token</code>, I get the compile error.</p>

<pre><code>Couldn't match expected type `Control.Monad.Trans.State.Lazy.State
                                Text.Parsec.Pos.SourcePos'

<p>Here is a couple of issues I'm founding:</p>

<ul>
<li>Time stamp don't show as timestamp (I even tried the simple example from plotly and R and verified that it doesn't work on Shiny). In fact timestamp is categorize as string and the xaxis tittle can't be seen as a result of this. </li>
<li>Challenges getting the yaxis2 and 3 in the same axes without overlapping with the chart itself. </li>
</ul>

<p>To solve this wonder if there is a format that we can pass into the xaxis (tried <code>type='date'</code> but didn't work) and if there is any type of auto-arrange on the yaxis on the right (2 and 3).</p>

The strange thing is that the exported function has no arguments, so the problem is not in the Marshalling of data. The function gets no argument and just returns an integer. Also note that calling convention is not an issue. An identical function with the same zero arguments and integer return value (but different name) works just fine. What are the remaining  candidate reasons that such a call could cause this exception considering the fact that marshalling and calling convention is ruled out? </p>

<p>UPDATE: The dll function is correct because if called from other unmanaged code through plain linking, then it works perfectly. </p>

<p>UPDATE 2: Everything is compiled and run on 32 bit. I tried Win XP SP2 and Vista. Here is an interesting fact: On Vista Systems it works like a charm. On XP it fails.</p>

<p>UPDATE 3: I didnt get the source code but I learned what essentially this dll does, so i tried to reproduce the problem with my own dll. Here is the story: The original dll is some kind of a wrapper to ei.lib (Erlang's c interface library). It exports some helper funcs. So  to reproduce the problem I have made a wrapper dll around ei.lib which exports only one function, namely ""test()"". I did that so I wouldnt mess with marshalling and stuff. I wanted just to test an initialization, connecting and sending a message. So this test() func of my dll just calls <code>ei_connect_init()</code>, then <code>ei_connect()</code> and finaly <code>ei_reg_send()</code>, with arguments hardcoded inside. The problem is that if I call this dll and use the test() function from another unmanaged code, it works ok. Message is sent. But when I call it from c# through DllImport then it works only on Vista. Not on XP. On XP it fails with a AccessViolationException on the .net layer. I ve tried to trace down the problem and I see that from inside my dll, any call to <code>ei_connect()</code>, or any attempt to read <code>erl_errno</code> (these are defined in ei.lib) when running on XP and being called by managed code result in trying to read or write protected memory so the app crashes. It cant be something trivial since it works on Vista and it works when called by unmanaged code.  </p>

<p>I use the <a href=""http://www.highcharts.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Highcharts API</a> to render SVG. When I convert it with a tool like <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/rsvg-convert.1.html"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>rsvg-convert</strong></a> (I've also tried imagemagick, graphicsmagick and inkscape) the SVG is rendered perfectly into the PDF container. The only thing I'm missing in the generated PDF is the background-image.</p>

<p>I can produce PNG/JPG without any problems by converting the SVG to a transparent PNG and then melting this with a background-image. Of course I could just throw such a melted image into a PDF container but that's not what I want.</p>

<p>I need to <strong>keep the SVG as a transparent vectorized image</strong> with a JPG or PNG as <strong>background-image</strong> and the whole construct <strong>in a PDF container</strong>.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>Does anybody know how to solve this on an Ubuntu shell? I'm using PHP's exec function to execute shell commands and I can modify the SVG before it's passed to the shell execution process. Please forgive me that I don't provide more information now, I'd rather like to keep the question itself as short as possible but answer your questions in detail.</p>

<p>The algorithms described are probably the best answers but are very difficult to implement in Java. Moreover, in my use cases the text would be prominent much like above. The above algorithms seem like overkill. I would be grateful if anyone can suggest any alternative to solve this problem. Thanks!</p>

<p>How can I disable Non-ASCII characters for DexGuard-obfuscation?</p>

I'm getting different behavior from the two different formats I'd like to play. The first type (youtube lq 3gp) plays fine. The second type (youtube hq mp4) will start to play the audio before the TIOverlay functions are run (so no video), then once the video is drawn it's out of sync with the audio. I know the hq mp4 format is supported by my phone because it is the type played by the mobile youtube site which works fine. More info on the formats <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#Quality_and_codecs"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>So I guess I either need a way to force the TIOverlay to run, or a way to listen for it to be ready and not to start the video until that point. Some logcat output below shows the flow, it's interesting when onPrepared() is called in both cases. The 3gp seems to do TIOverlay calls before and after onPrepared(), while the mp4 only does them after.</p>

<p>Edit: The same code seems to be working on a Motorola Droid 3. Still, if that video format works on youtube on my Droid 1, I feel like it should work in my app as well.
I tried waiting to play the video until it was buffered a little bit. Not only did this not solve the problem, but the buffer also restarted upon starting the video.</p>

I want Cassandra to handle session expiry using TTL settings on the various columns. The problem I have now is that the various objects within a session all expire at different times, so a session loses unused objects over time - even when the session (and other session objects) is continuously accessed.</p>

<p>Is there a way in which I can set the TTL on a super column, and have all data stored under a key in this super column expire when the key expires?</p>

<p>I don't want to traverse all data stored within the web session each time a HTTP response is returned, as this would incur unnecessary I/O between the tomcat plugin and Cassandra. I also don't want to keep any in memory cache in the Tomcat plugin, as I want Tomcat to be completely stateless and maintain all user session state purely in Cassandra.</p>

<p>This Tomcat plugin is pretty nifty, as it allows previously stageful web applications to become stateless - thus allowing horizontal scaling. It would be fantastic to get over this TTL issue...</p>

<pre><code>  public class MyConverter: IValueConverter
  {
    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture)
    {
      // OK, we test for some undesirable, unconvertable situation, typically null...
      if (value == null)
      {
        // And here are a variety of 'defaults' that I have seen, these begin the most typical.

I tested a different image by trying to upload an image directly into the HTML using the  element, and that won't load either. This lead me to question if the paths were wrong, but I can't seem to find an error in my directory structure or code. I tested in firebug, and see that the error is 'failed to load the given url'.

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but this particular timeout could have to do with apache's timeout setting, but not necessarily. I believe this to be the case because when testing the page in question we couldn't get it to time out reliably - mostly the browser would just spin for as long as it took.</p>

<p>The timeout setting would come into effect if there were issues with the connection to the client, as described in <a href=""http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#timeout"" rel=""nofollow"">the documentation</a>. But if the connection was fine, it would be up to the client to close the connection (I believe).</p>

<p>I assumed this also meant that if the client closed their browser, Apache would hit the timeout limit (in my case, 300 seconds), and kill the process. This doesn't seem to be the case.</p>

<p>Here's how I tested it:<br>
I added a while loop to some code on the server:</p>

<pre><code>too_long = 2000
tstart = time.time()
f = open('/tmp/timeout_test.txt', 'w')
while True:
    time.sleep(100)
    elapsed = time.time() - tstart
    f.write('Loop, %s elapsed\n' % elapsed)
    if elapsed &gt; too_long:
        break
</code></pre>

<p>I then open the web page to launch that loop, and ran netstat on the server:</p>

<pre><code>~$ netstat -np | grep ESTAB | grep apache
tcp        0      0 10.102.123.6:443        10.102.119.101:53519    ESTABLISHED 16534/apache2
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:60299         127.0.0.1:5432          ESTABLISHED 16534/apache2
</code></pre>

<p>(that's me at 10.102.119.101, the server is at 10.102.123.6)<br>
I then closed my browser and reran that netstat line:</p>

<pre><code>~% netstat -np | grep ESTAB | grep apache
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:60299         127.0.0.1:5432          ESTABLISHED 16534/apache2
</code></pre>

<p>My connection disappeared, but the server was still in the loop, I could confirm by running:</p>

<pre><code>~% lsof | grep timeout
apache2   16534   www-data   14w      REG        8,1        0     536533 /tmp/timeout_test.txt
</code></pre>

<p>meaning the apache process still had that file open. For the next 2000 seconds, when I ran:</p>

<pre><code>~% cat /tmp/timeout_test.txt
</code></pre>

<p>I got nothing. After 2000 seconds the netcat line produced nothing at all, and the tmp file was filled out with the output from the while loop.</p>

<p>So it seems that Apache process just does what it was asked to do, regardless of the client connection? And what is that loopback connection about?</p>

<p>Just wrote my first app for training for a half marathon. It is a run/walk timer that plays a ""Run"" or ""Walk"" sound when it's time to switch activity mode, users select those intervals. 
The app works fine on my phone when it's active, but stops in the background.   I searched  through a lot of posts on Stackflow, and many said you should not use NStimer in the background.<br>
Would love some help is getting this to work in the background. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I've defaulted the naming convention in the client side to camel case using the following code.</p>

<pre><code>breeze.NamingConvention.camelCase.setAsDefault();
</code></pre>

<p>so, I started to map the entity as follows</p>

<pre><code>store.addEntityType({
        shortName: ""Photo"",
        namespace: ""MyProj.Models"",
        dataProperties: {
            id: {
                dataType: DataType.Guid,
                isNullable: false,
                isPartOfKey: true
            },
            title: {
                dataType: DataType.String
            },
            description: {
                dataType: DataType.String
            },
            createdDate: {
                dataType: DataType.DateTime
            },
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>This worked all fine, except the id field is not getting the proper value. instead, it has the default value set by the breeze datatype ctor which is equals to <code>Guid.Empty</code>.</p>

<p>by stepping through breezejs debug script, I found out that it looks for a property name called <code>Id</code> in the data that comes from the ajax request. But it can't find it as the property is <code>ID</code> so it initialize it to <code>empty guid</code> string. I assumed that by setting <code>nameOnServer</code> property of the <code>dataProperty</code> <code>id</code>, I will be able to fix it.</p>

<pre><code>store.addEntityType({
        shortName: ""Photo"",
        namespace: ""MyProj.Models"",
        dataProperties: {
            id: {
                dataType: DataType.Guid,
                isNullable: false,
                nameOnServer: 'ID',
                isPartOfKey: true
            },
            title: {
                dataType: DataType.String
            },
            description: {
                dataType: DataType.String
            },
            createdDate: {
                dataType: DataType.DateTime
            },
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>But it didn't work.</p>

<p>Further digging through the breez.debug.js code, in the method <code>updateClientServerNames</code> on line 7154, it seems it ignores the <code>nameOnServer</code> that I have defined.</p>

<p>I'm using Avalon Edit (ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.dll 4.4.2) in a WPF 4.0 application.
I have loaded a text file (~7 MBytes) into the editor. When I apply syntax highlighting and then coping (Control-A and Control-C) the whole text it takes forever (without highlighting it's done in a second)</p>

<p>When I break into debugger I get the following callstack (shortened):</p>

<p>It seems the editor creates html-based content for the clipboard and uses RegularExpressions which takes forever (~30 seconds).</p>

<ol>
<li>The function begins with two table name parameters, a starting-point and a target</li>
<li>The function then traverses a list of table-column combinations (50,000 long) and retrieves all the combinations associated with the starting-point table.</li>
<li>The function then loops through each of the retrieved combinations and for each combination, it traverses the table-column combinations list once again, but this time looking for tables that match the given column.</li>
<li>Finally, the function loops through each of the retrieved combinations from the last step and for each combination, it checks whether the table is the same as the target table; if so it saves it, and if not it calls itself passing in the table name form that combination.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>The function aim is to be able to trace a link between tables where the link is direct or has multiple degrees of separation. The level of recursion is a fixed integer value.</em></p>

<p><strong>My problem is that any time I try to run this function for two levels of search depth (wouldn't dare try deeper at this stage), the job runs out of memory, or I lose patience. I waited for 17mins before the job ran out of memory once.</strong></p>

<p>The average number of columns per table is 28 and the standard deviation is 34.</p>

<p>Here is a diagram showing examples of the various links that can be made between tables:</p>

<p>Now, as you can see all the images src's are imported from an external XML file containing the data (images names are progressive ex.:photo001.jpg, photo002.jpg and so on). </p>

<p>They are created in the DOM trough a for loop and appended to a div.</p>

<p>What's the issue you may say ? I need all images to be appended in a progressive way as specified on the XML data but this happens only on the local computer and not if uploaded on some server. I figure out that this is due to the different loading time of each image depending on size... but i still can't figure out how to work this around. Does anyone have any idea ?</p>

<p>I want to have a 'save' button with a linked property in order to disable the button whenever there are no records pending update.</p>

<p>I suppose there are a few ways to do this but I'm looking for the correct 'ember' way of doing things.</p>

<p>What is the easiest approach here? AFAICS I can..</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Manually set a global property whenever a property is changed - and reset it whenever the store is synced to the server</p></li>
<li><p>Have a property on my controller which is calculated based on the contents of the store. I was able to do this like so But I found that the property did not update when the store was updated.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>...</p>

<pre><code>hasUpdates: function() {
    console.log('hej!')
    return (this.get('store').get('defaultTransaction.buckets.updated.list.length') &gt; 0);
}.property('store')
</code></pre>

<p>This must be a common pattern - how do I do this?</p>

<p>Edit: Will keep answer updated with things that dont work</p>

The website uses Castle Windors Monorail and NVelocity as the template.  The menu is currently rendered using custom made subclasses of ViewComponent, which render li elements.  At the moment there is only one (horizontal) level, so the current mechanism is fine.</p>

<p>I have been asked to add drop down menus to some of the existing menus.  As this is the first time I have seen Monorail and NVelocity, I'm a little lost.</p>

<p>What currently exists:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
    #component(MenuComponent with ""title=Home"" ""hover=autoselect"" ""link=/"")
    #component(MenuComponent with ""title=Videos"" ""hover=autoselect"")

<p>Is it possible to have nested MenuComponents (or a new SubMenuComponent) something like:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I need to draw the sub menu (ul and li elements) inside the overridden Render method on MenuComponent, so using nested ViewComponent derivatives may not work.  I would like a method keep the basically declarative method for creating menus, if at all possible.</p>

<p>edit: I can use Context.RenderBody() to render the nested ViewComponent derivitives, but they're being rendered before the parent.  I guess the rending of the sub menus need to somehow hook into the same output as the parent?</p>

Unfortunately,  I can’t produce exactly what  I need, just sort of.
I would be very grateful for some hints from someone more experienced, maybe there is a reasonable R regex cheat cheet ?</p>

<p>File are named r2_m1_enzyme.csv,  the script should use the first 4 characters to name the corresponding dataframe r2_m1, and so on…</p>

<pre><code># generates a list of dataframes, to mimic a lapply(f,read.csv) output:
data &lt;- list(data.frame(c(1,2)),data.frame(c(1,2)),data.frame(c(1,2)),data.frame(c(1,2)))

# this mimics file names obtained by  list.files() function
f &lt;-c(""r1_m1_enzyme.csv"",""r2_m1_enzyme.csv"",""r1_m2_enzyme.csv"",""r2_m2_enzyme.csv"")

# this should name the data frames according to the csv file they have been derived from
names(data) &lt;- gsub(""r*_m*_.*"",""\\1"", f)
</code></pre>

<p>but it doesnt work as expected... they are named r2_m1_enzyme.csv instead of the desired r2_m1, although .* should stop it?</p>

<p>If I do:</p>

<pre><code>names(data) &lt;- gsub(""r*_.*"",""\\1"", f)

<p>I do get r1, r2, r3 ... but I am missing my second index. </p>

In the past I've seen performance degradation in function like <code>boost::to_lower</code> because of the <code>CriticalSection</code> employed in <code>std::use_facet</code> when the lazy facet is allocated. As far as I remember there was a bug with global lock on locale but according to Stephan Lavavej it was fixed in VS2013. And voila, I saw this lock on facet killing server performance yesterday so I guess I'm confusing two different issues.
<br> But in the first place, why there is a <code>CriticalSection</code> around the lazy facet? Obviously it will ruin the performance. Why they didnt resolve to some kind of upgradable lock or atomic operations on pointers?</p>

What can we do to avoid this? Are there any settings in Access to provide better transactional control?</p>

<p>Here are some more details:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have one access user that has write access (shared by a very limited number of users - currently only me as the others are on vacation).</li>
<li>We have another access user that is used by many people that only has read access.</li>
<li>Some changes to the data are made by the write user. </li>
<li>After leaving and re-entering the table and/or even the application, the changes seem to have been ""committed"".</li>
<li>After a while (usually overnight) the changes are lost and the data is back to the old values.</li>
</ul>

<p>What can cause this behavior?</p>

<p>Our theory is that this is caused by some weird transactional control within Access. The read-only user gets some kind of ""exclusive lock"" to the data that is used within a query or form. Once the user leaves that query/form, Access makes sure that this is still in the database. If in the meantime the write user has changed the data, these changes will be reverted when the read only user leaves the query/form, resulting in a lost update. Does this make sense? Is this a known issue with MS-Access??</p>

<p>Also, we're interested how we can avoid this issue. Is this something that is inherent in Access and can only be avoided by switching to a ""real"" database with better transactional control? (From a technical viewpoint, that would be nice; but of course it would be an urgent todo that we would rather avoid at this point in the project.)</p>

<p>Thanks for any input and let me know if there is extra information that is required.</p>

<p>Say my program's got (user-scope) settings like ""server name"", ""address"", ""port"". I'd just add those three to the Application Settings as two strings and an int.<br>
But what if my program's config needs to deal with multiple such servers, where the user can add and remove any number of them? I would want the settings to hold an array of triplets, each triplet made of two strings and an int, and the Application Settings don't quite seem to support that.</p>

<p>It's a relatively lightweight structure made of basic types, but so far the cleanest way I've found to do this is to create a new class(!) just to hold the array of triplets, fit the class with custom serialization/deserialization code, and then set it as the type of a single ""setting"".<br>
I <em>could</em> do this, but considering how hands-off most of the Application Settings is, this really smells like something that's probably doable in a more straightforward way.</p>

<p>So is there such a way?</p>

<p>(Yes, I've seen the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1766610/how-to-store-int-array-in-application-settings"">""int[] array in application Settings""</a> question, and the useful answers from there are not that useful in this situation.)</p>

<p><strong>ETA:</strong> The point of the question isn't in server names or port numbers, it's in an <em>array</em> of identically-structured <em>tuples</em> of simple data, where each individual datum would be trivially saved.</p>

<p>Everything worked fined on different screen sizes however when I tried to check on 480x854 resolution the vertical alignment of the custom view was incorrect. Checked with 480x800 on the same screen size and it again works. I than went for a big jump and checked in GalaxyTab and the horizontal and vertical alignments were wrong. Now my first though was that the bitmap width and height were the one of the image not the actual resized imageview. So I spent a lot of time on trying to get the real size of the imageview and even went for viewTreeObserver but the results were all the same - the correct, unchanged (unscaled?) bitmap size. So being positive that the problem is not here I couldn't get through further. Does anyone have an idea why the alignment is not working correctly?</p>

<p>PS: as for the image view in layout xml file I have 2 configurations for long and notlong but this image has the same description in both:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ImageView 
 android:src=""@drawable/cloking"" 
 android:id=""@+id/imageViewClk""
 android:layout_height=""wrap_content"" 
 android:layout_width=""wrap_content""

 android:layout_above=""@+id/imageViewProcess""
 android:adjustViewBounds=""true""
 android:cropToPadding=""false"" 
 android:layout_marginTop=""60dp"" 
 android:scaleType=""fitXY""&gt;
&lt;/ImageView&gt;

I can get the first row to generate properly with the following code, but, no matter what I do, I cannot get the next rows to work right. They all generate the right way in that I get the numbers 1-9 in a random order, but I cannot get it to make a workable Sudoku puzzle.</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableArray *array = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:8];
    for (int integerA = 0; integerA &lt; 10; integerA ++) {
        [array addObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:integerA]];
        //NSLog(@""%i"", (integerA + 1));
    }

 for (int x = 8; x &gt;= 0; x --) {
        [array exchangeObjectAtIndex:(arc4random() % (x + 1)) withObjectAtIndex:x];
        section[x][0] = ([[array objectAtIndex:x] intValue] + 1);

<p>However, I am confused about:</p>

<p>1) Must the add-on undergo the review process even if it is NOT made available in the Mozilla gallery? </p>

<p>I'm getting an error (""..does not match the add-on Firefox expected."") when trying to install it and don't know if this is because of its non-reviewed status.</p>

<p>2) It looks like updates also have to undergo the review process. For approved updates to take affect, do people need to have installed the add-on via the gallery? Or can they have added it via my website? Is there any way to auto-update non-reviewed/approved add-ons.</p>

<p>3) How long is the approval process? Can it really take several weeks to publish an add-on? What's 'normal'?</p>

<p>How about for updates? If I discover a bug in my code, or need to make an improvement, can it really take up to 10 days(!) for the fix to be applied across all users!?</p>

<p>3b) My add-on only works if the user is logged into my service/website. It collects data from the website and needs to know what account to send it to. If you're not logged in, you get a message to please log in. Can such an add-on be approved? It's more cumbersome to test.</p>

<p>4) When I wrote the add-on I had assumed that this would be similar to creating a Chrome extension, which was essentially instant. <b>It seems that this is, instead, a cumbersome process with big risks; especially the slow update process is risk factor.

<p>How to change the PHP code to output the XML as requested by web service provider?</p>

<p>How to replace the ""SOAP-ENV"" to ""S""?</p>

<p>Is there is a way to remove the NS1 and NS2? and also adjust the whole format of the XML to meet the requirements? thanks</p>

BG Loop used - m4a type<br>

<p>I've researched everywhere in Google, Apple's documents, and in SO but I couldn't find anything regarding this particular scenario.</p>

<p>I even tried explicitly setting the AVAudioSession's category to AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient and then calling setActive. (Also tried the <code>setCategory:withOptions:error</code> method but the app crashes for some reason -- tested on device)</p>

<p><code>Warning: Parameter 2 to mysqli_stmt::bind_param() expected to be a reference, value given in /home/spot/trunk/system/core/Database.class.php on line 105</code></p>

<p>the line mentioned (105) is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>call_user_func_array(Array($stmt, 'bind_param'), $passArray);
</code></pre>

<p>we changed the line to  the following:</p>

<pre><code>call_user_func_array(Array($stmt, 'bind_param'), &amp;$passArray);
</code></pre>

<p>at this point (because <code>allow_call_time_pass_reference</code>) is turned off, php throws this:</p>

<p><code>Deprecated: Call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated in /home/spot/trunk/system/core/Database.class.php on line 105</code></p>

<p>After trying to fix this for some time, I broke down and set <code>allow_call_time_pass_reference</code> to on.</p>

<p>That got rid of the <code>Deprecated</code> warning, but now the <code>Warning: Parameter 2 to mysqli_stmt::bind_param() expected to be a reference</code> warning is throwing every time, <b>with or without</b> the referencing.</p>

<p>I have zero clue how to fix this. If the target method was my own, I would just reference the incoming vars in the func declaration, but it's a (relatively) native method (mysqli).</p>

<p>Has anyone experienced this? How can I get around it?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I'm trying to create a ProfileViewController (where the user profile is loaded, like profile image, likes and pictures) by making a click in the profile image inside a TableViewController (TableView).</p>

<p>At the moment is not working, because everything that I touch is going to a Segue (the post's segue where you can see the entry, likes and comments) but I need to create something (maybe it's a touch gesture) over the author image of that entry and show me his profile.</p>

<p>I have tried by creating a Tap Gesture Recognizer but it's not working. Also a Segue action directly in the Storyboard, and it's not working.</p>

<p>I'm going to show you an example, because at the ends it's like Facebook wall:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jd10W.jpg"" alt=""Example Image""></p>

<p>If I touch in the profile image it displays the user profile page with his information. I want to achieve that but with the image inside a TableView.</p>

<p>Here is what I got at the moment:</p>

<p>you can see it in action here on polymers site: <a href=""https://www.polymer-project.org/components/paper-elements/demo.html#paper-checkbox"" rel=""nofollow"">sampler-scaffold</a></p>

<p>I want to use it for is a single page app (SPA) and would like to load my custom elements into the scaffold instead of loading extraneous iframes that have no connection to my SPA model.</p>

<p>The actual swap happens here in their code:</p>

<pre><code>frameLoaded: function() {
    if (!this.item) {
      return;
    }
    this.$.frame.contentWindow.addEventListener('polymer-ready', function() {
      setTimeout(this.updateFrameHeight.bind(this), 100);
      this.$.frame.contentWindow.addEventListener('core-resize',
        this.boundResizeFrame, false);
    }.bind(this));
  },
</code></pre>

<p>and the DOM object that is manipulated:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- main content --&gt;
&lt;div id=""frameContainer""&gt;
    &lt;iframe id=""frame"" on-load=""{{frameLoaded}}""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- End main content --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What i tried to do was replace the iframe element with a content element and load my custom elements into the content tag, but the page simply dosn't load the main panel that slides up and no errors are logged. Additionally, there are a few helper functions that adjust the frame height after the iframe has loaded. You can see their source code here for <code>&lt;sampler-scaffold&gt;</code>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.polymer-project.org/components/sampler-scaffold/sampler-scaffold.html"" rel=""nofollow"">sampler scaffold source</a></p>

<p>Has anyone modded the <code>&lt;sampler-scaffold&gt;</code> away from loading iframes?</p>

<p>if not - can i still achieve a data heavy application with polymer's <code>&lt;sampler-scaffold&gt;</code> element and iframes?</p>

<p>I am afraid that loading iframes instead of pages/elements will just give me headaches when i try to connect to my DBs and send real time statistics via HTTP</p>

<p>Background: Computer Engineer/programmer of arbitrary languages-rusty at C++/very rusty at visual studio/inexperienced with 3D balls to the wall programming.</p>

<p>DirectX Progress: I found this excelent tutorial (<a href=""http://3dgep.com/introduction-to-directx-11/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://3dgep.com/introduction-to-directx-11/</a>) and I rebuilt it walking thru the code; this taught me a lot. My code never actually would run though, likely an issue with linkers or precompiled headers, so I reverted back to the original Demo File.</p>

<p>Oculus Progress: I've learned a lot about using the LibOVR, successfully compiled my first program which was to gather sensor data. Never ran it though.</p>

<p>Visual Studio: I currently have one solution setup, with two projects (DirectXTemplate and LibOVR). I'm thinking I should merge the two projects and turn the DirectXTemplate into a library so I can access all the functions defined in these files (though I will likely need to modify them as development progresses). <strong>How do I go about doing this? Is this the right thing to do?</strong></p>

<p>I also have some general questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>List item</p>

<p>Projects/Solutions: what is the difference and how should I lay things out to achieve my goal?</p></li>
<li><p>List item</p>

<p>My winAPI main function is in my own cpp file, it calls functions from directXtempalte... most of these are working except the LoadContent function fails about half way thru, I think due to the shaders. I'm really confused about the shaders in the tutorial, particularly walking about at compile time vs. at run time shaders and suspect its an issue with the Linker, precompiled headers, include directories or something like that. There are so many views of the properties tab in VS its causing more confusion and errors. So my real question here is how do I control this better? I mean, the properties window changes depending on what project/solution/file I select and it also changes based on the mode selected in the properties window... getting the properties window right for all these objects has proven to be a highly error prone process requiring iterative trial and error... this really really sucks and wastes tons of time... <strong>How can it be avoided?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>List item</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How do I turn the directX template in to a library like the LIBOVR and should I?</strong> Keep in mind the directX template/library will be updated massively as the project progresses but LIBOVER will not be. When all things are done, I'll be using the LIBOVR functions for to deal with the oculus (this is static but is updated by the Vendor) and DirectXTemplate/Library functions to deal with direct X (this will be custom build, using the template as the starting point.</p>

<p>The customer's data being returned somehow had vertical tab characters in it.  Looking at our XML, we could see that these characters were being properly rendered as <code>&amp;#xB;</code> entities.  Doing a quick Google search, we found that there is a bug with <code>XmlSerializer</code> where it can't handle certain entities, which has to be fixed by changing an option in the the auto-generated proxies' XML Readers.</p>

<p>The consumer acknowledges that they need to fix their client-side code, but they are unable to quickly respond to this issue with a patch.  They would like us to apply a patch in our own code to filter out these forbidden characters.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the list of problem characters for <code>XmlSerializer</code> documented anywhere?</li>
<li>Is there a clean way for us to change our WCF service so that we can automatically strip out characters without resorting to doing string replaces in all of our web methods?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I found the answer to #1.  According to <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Char"" rel=""nofollow"">the XML spec</a>, only certain character codes are allowed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Char ::= #x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20-#xD7FF] | [#xE000-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#x10FFFF]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems like the <code>DataContractSerializer</code> on our server is what's in error here.  I'm looking into how to customize that serializer now.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>It looks like the <code>DataContractSerializer</code> issue is known and <a href=""http://connect.microsoft.com/wcf/feedback/details/465688/data-contract-serializer-violates-xml-specification-1-0-and-1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">logged in Microsoft Connect</a>.</p>
