<p>However, I got the following error:</p>

<pre><code>leo% zeus test

  ... etc ...
</code></pre>

<p>The line mentioned in the Turn gem is:</p>

<pre><code># set MiniTest's runner to Turn::MiniRunner instance
if MiniTest::Unit.respond_to?(:runner=)
  MiniTest::Unit.runner = Turn::MiniRunner.new
else
  raise ""MiniTest v#{MiniTest::Unit::VERSION} is out of date.\n"" \
        ""`gem install minitest` and add `gem 'minitest' to you test helper.""
  #MiniTest::Unit = Turn::MiniRunner
end
</code></pre>

<p>So the 'out of date' is a bit misleading perhaps. What it really means is the API is not what’s expected, right?</p>

<p>I removed <code>gem 'turn'</code> from my Gemfile, run <code>bundle install</code>, and restart Zeus.</p>

<p>Now I get:</p>

<p>I think there is validation required by each level:</p>

<ol>
<li>Did the user input a sane value 
<ul>
<li>are dates actual dates, are numbers actualy numbers ...</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do all of the checks in 1. again plus checks for malicious attacks(IE XSS or SQL injection) 
<ul>
<li>The checks done in 1. are mainly to avoid a server round trip when the user makes a mistake.</li>
<li>Since they are done on the client side in javascript, you can't trust that they were run. Validating these values again will stop some malicious attacks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are dependencies met (ie. did the user add a comment to a valid question)

<p>I am currently working on a university website, and for some reason Firefox refuses to load the site unless you use www (ex www.university.edu). Every other browser accepts university.edu and simply redirects to www.university.edu as nginx is setup to do. My nginx config:</p>

<pre><code>server {
    listen 80;
    server_name university.edu www;
    rewritei    ^http://www.university.edu$request_uri? permanent;
}
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name  www.university.edu static.university.edu m.university.edu www.university.com;
    .
    .
    .
}
</code></pre>

<p>So what should happen is when a request comes in and is www.university.edu, the second block catches it and everything runs normally, but if a request comes in and is university.edu the first block catches it and redirects it to the second block. But for some reason Firefox is not doing this.</p>

<p>Any idea's what could be causing this issue?</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong>
rewritei is not mispelled. The university's nginx was changed before it was compiled to enable regex case insensitivity, and was placed under the function ""rewritei"". Also after playing around with the site I found figured out that if you visit the site at www.university.edu first, then try university.edu it will load, but if you clear the cache and try to visit university.edu it will not load until you visit www.university.edu.</p>

The ng-click code is added to a string of html from data pulled from the server (hence the ng-bind-html). The setup has a controller, a base template that is put onto the page with Drupal, and a partial that is loaded via the template from Drupal.</p>

<p>The controller looks like this at the moment:</p>

<pre><code>var guideListController = angular.module('app')
  .controller('guideListController', [
    '$scope',
    '$sce',
    '$compile',
    'ViewService',
    'ToolKit',
  function($scope, $sce, $compile, ViewService, ToolKit) {

  // Storage for which rows need more/less links
  this.rowIndex = [];

  this.showFull = false;
  this.showFullClick = function() {
    alert('Showfull');
  };

  this.trustIntro = function(code) {
    return $sce.trustAsHtml(code);
  };

  // Fetch the guide list view from services
  var data = ViewService.get({view_endpoint:'guide-service', view_path: 'guide-list'}, function(data) {
    //console.log(data);

    // Update/process results 
    for (var row in data.results) {

      // Create short intro w/ truncate.js
      data.results[row].Intro_short = $sce.trustAsHtml($scope.guideList.getShortIntro(data.results[row], row));
      //data.results[row].Intro_short = $scope.guideList.getShortIntro(data.results[row], row);

      // Update intro
      data.results[row].Introduction = $sce.trustAsHtml($scope.guideList.updateIntro(data.results[row], row));
      //data.results[row].Introduction = $scope.guideList.updateIntro(data.results[row], row);

    }
    $scope.guideList.guides = data.results;
  });


  // Add a read less anchor tag at the end of the main intro
  this.updateIntro = function(row, row_index) {
    var intro = row['Introduction'].trim();

    if ($scope.guideList.rowIndex[row_index]) { // only apply Less link if needed
      var index = intro.length - 1;
      var tag = [];
      if (intro.charAt(index) === '&gt;') { // we have a tag at the end
        index--;
        do {
          tag.push(intro.charAt(index));
          index--;
        } while (intro.charAt(index) != '/'); // the closing tag
        index--; // we move the index one more for the ""&lt;""
        tag.reverse(); // Reverse
        tag = tag.join('');
      }

      var inserts = ['div', 'p']; // we insert the Less link here.
      if (jQuery.inArray(tag, inserts) &gt;= 0) { // insert into the tag
        intro = intro.substr(0, index) + ' &lt;a class=""less"" ng-click=""$parent.guideList.showFull = false""&gt;Less&lt;/a&gt;' + intro.substr(index);
      }
      else { // insert at the end of the html
        intro = intro + '&lt;a class=""less"" ng-click=""this.showFull = false""&gt;Less&lt;/a&gt;';
      }
    }

    return intro; 
  };


  // Truncate the long intro into a shorter length blurb
  this.getShortIntro = function(row, row_index) {
    // Truncate if necc.
    var short_intro = jQuery.truncate(row['Introduction'], {
      length: 250,
      words: true,
      ellipsis: '\u2026 &lt;a class=""more moreish"" attr-ng-click=""guideList.showFullClick()""&gt;Read&amp;nbsp;on&lt;/a&gt;'
    });

    var more = jQuery('.more', short_intro); // select more link

    if (more.length) { // do we have a more link
      $scope.guideList.rowIndex[row_index] = true;
    }
    else { // no more link
      $scope.guideList.rowIndex[row_index] = false;
    }
    $compile(short_intro)($scope);
    return short_intro;
  };
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see in the ViewService.get() call, data is fetched and then processed. The processing simply involves putting a link at the end of the ""Intro"" field that is intended to be clickable.</p>

<p>For a while I was having a tough time to even get the ng-click directive to even show (it was being filtered out w/out $sce.trustAsHtml). Now it is there but clicking it has no effect.</p>

<p>The main template (from Drupal) currently looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""guide-listing"" ng-controller=""guideListController as guideList""&gt;
  &lt;a ng-click=""guideList.showFullClick()""&gt;Click me&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=""guide-teaser"" 
       ng-repeat=""guide in guideList.guides""
       ng-include src=""'/sites/all/themes/ngTheme/ngApp/partials/guide_teaser.html'""&gt;
       &lt;!-- See guide_teaser.html partial for guide teasers --&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The ng-click as placed in the Drupal template above works as expected.</p>

<p>And for the partial that is used in the ng-repeat, it looks like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller=""guideListController as guideList""&gt;
  &lt;h2 class=""guide-teaser-title""&gt;&lt;a href=""{{guide.path}}""&gt;{{guide.node_title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;div class=""guide-teaser-intro"" ng-bind-html=""guide.Introduction"" ng-show=""guide.showFull""&gt;
    {{guide.Introduction}}
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""guide-teaser-intro-short"" ng-bind-html=""guide.Intro_short"" ng-show=""!guide.showFull""&gt;
    {{guide.Intro_short}}
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So far I have only been working on getting the ng-click to work on the short_intro and have had no success so far. Any ideas as to what I am doing wrong would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>I'd like to create this in CSS only and wonder if this is possible. So far I came up with two different approaches which have their own drawbacks and are not fully sufficient. You can have a look at those in this fiddle:</p>

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>Approach 1 <code>.one-side-skew-1</code>  uses a div element with round borders and a skewed, round-bordered pseudo element to create a one-side skewed element in sum. This works great as long as the background-color is solid. For semi-transparent backgrounds you will see an ugly color overlap where the element and its pseudo-element meet.</p>

<p>Approach 2 <code>.one-side-skew2</code> uses a div element with a pseudo behind it that consists of borders only. It's somewhat hacky but gets close to my desired result. Still, the right does not look nearly as smooth as in the first approach. </p>

<p>Does someone else have a good solution for this problem in CSS only? Or will I have to use a fallback solution with a semi-transparent background-image to solve this?</p>

<p>Now, prior to the existence of this product a lot of work was done/managed using spreadsheets and it wasn't <em>visible to all</em>, so to speak - there was a need to have the core functionality/data be visible to all and also have the capability of <em>exporting to excel</em> when the need be (i.e., when presenting for a report or submitting to the <em>higher ups</em> or when not having access to the web-based system etc).</p>

<p>So we are now designing the upcoming version of the product to make it 'social' so that everyone can see what's going on and manage/plan <em>as you go along</em>. The question is what's the best strategy we can employ to prevent from duplicating what excel already does a fine job at, on the web based system.</p>

<p>So here's what we came up with:</p>

<ol>
<li>Duplicate the functionality - i.e.,  have a table-based matrix-like structure for the content and have javascript calculate the results which could be committed to the server when the user says so (or after some time-out. Latter could be added later :)</li>
<li>Just use the front-end for the data-collection but no numerical calculation - have everything exported into an excel sheet that would do the calculations for you. However, knowing the calculations/numbers is critical for the <em>visible to all</em> part since that's what drives the management/planning effort!</li>
<li>Have some sort of web-based excel plugin that could speed up the development effort - effectively help us do the calculations and <em>pull out the results</em> to be used in the web-app. The problem is I don't know of any solutions like this out there! Any help/pointers/links would be greatly appreciated.</li>
</ol>

<p>The pain points are keeping developmental time/costs low - each solution is progressively cheaper so to speak. Basically we have the need for a 'math-engine' like design, where the numbers are entered, the results are calculated and we can use that for the project (in the tool). There has to be <em>some</em> way of getting the numbers from the users, calculating the end results/scores and updating the content on the web-app. Exporting to excel (that would have the similar functionality would be required for the above mentioned reasons as well as doing further sensitivity analysis <em>by yourself</em>, so to speak).</p>

<p>What's the best way to approach this problem? We are open to Javascript/Jquery solutions or CSS3/HTML 5. No Flash or Flex though.</p>

<p>Now <code>obj1</code> is an instance of class B which is superclass , so why does the <code>toString()</code> show it to be object of A ? Also how can instanceof operator show it to be instance of class A ?</p>

Basically, it has been decided that users should be allowed to upload an image for their profile, before they actually finish registering. Just, right there, in the middle of the registration form, a completely separate form (functionally, it has to look the same) with a file upload field, a separate submit button, and an image display area. Apparently, the customer saw AJAX image uploading on another site, and decided, ""That's cool, we want that!"" without actually knowing how forms work or taking into account why an unregistered user should be uploading things to begin with</p>

<p>My initial idea was to create an invisible form elsewhere, and copy over the file box value when the button is clicked, followed by the AJAX submission. That doesn't work because JavaScript can't edit the value of a file box. Understandable.</p>

<p>Second attempt was to create nested forms. With <a href=""http://anderwald.info/internet/nesting-form-tags-in-xhtml/"" rel=""nofollow"">some hacking</a>, I did manage to get FireFox to see two forms, but submitting the inner one submits the outer one. ""Undefined behavior"", I believe is the term. Makes sense, you're not supposed to nest forms.</p>

<p>So - ignoring the fact that this makes absolutely no sense, and the client really ought to be told that - is there any way left to create a file upload form on a page, that can be submitted via AJAX, and is visibly located within another form? I'm hoping to avoid just creating the form elsewhere on the page and hammering it into place with abhorrent CSS hacks.</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>To copy to clipboard, switch view to plain text mode<br>
This is inside the MyClass, which sets its own geometry and this function scales the <code>QWebView</code> appropriately to maintain aspect ratio. The Deletion for the <code>mWidget(QWebView pointer)</code> is being called when the MyClass object is deleted. Here is the process of how it is called.  </p>

<p>1.) MyClass is instantiated as “mclass”.  </p>

<p>2.) after instantiation, the playHtml method above is called on mclass object  </p>

<p>3.) the playHtml method above takes the full path to an html file that resides in a self-contained folder, the w/h are the pre-determined dimensions of the html content are used in scaling  </p>

<p>4.) after about 25 seconds, the mclass object is deleted  </p>

<p>4a.) during those 25 seconds the playHtml method scales the html content appropriately, and loads the html file. A lot of javascript happens for animation, etc.</p>

<p>5.) after the deletion another instantiation of MyClass occurs and the process is repeated</p>

<p>this process can be repeated literally 3000 times in a day, one after another. Neither the cpu nor ram are taxed during this time. The only thing I left out of the process above is the logging. I installed a MessageHandler to log the qDebug and other messages.</p>

<p>Here is what I am seeing in the logs after the above process runs for a while (anywhere from a couple of hours to a few days).</p>

<p>A bunch of these per instance of “MyClass”:  </p>

<pre><code>CRITICAL: QWindowsBackingStore::flush: GetDC failed ()
</code></pre>

<p>followed by a bunch of these per instance of “MyClass”:  </p>

<pre><code>CRITICAL: QWindowsBackingStore::flush: BitBlt failed ()
</code></pre>

<p>Followed shortly by a crash.</p>

<p>In the event viewer, I get the crash “Error” message. It is always in one of these faulting modules MSVCR100.dll or one of the Qt5Webkit or Qt5WebkitWidget dlls.</p>

<p>I am not specifically drawing anything. I relying on the QWebView to do that — both for drawing itself and the content it contains. It does it well except when the above starts occurring. Nothing else is running on the machine except the software.</p>

<p>How would one go about detecting errors like this? At this point, I don’t know anything about them until they get to the log. I would like to detect and deal with them before that time but am unsure how. As a side note, I would like to take this opportunity to learn more about error detection in general for Qt and C++. Primarily, how do I detect errors like this that seem to be occurring further up the food chain. I fear I have been spoiled by the stack traces provided by Java/C#.  </p>

<p>This is obviously taking a really long time.</p>

<p>If there is nothing in the database it does a straight import which is fast in itself.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Then i used it in form1 like this i added to form1 top:</p>

<pre><code>private globalKeyboardHook gkh = new globalKeyboardHook();
</code></pre>

<p>Then in form1 load event i did:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Keys&gt; C1 = new List&lt;Keys&gt; { Keys.LControlKey, Keys.G };
Combinaison Combinaison = new Combinaison(C1, Console);
</code></pre>

<p>Then the Console method:</p>

<pre><code>public void Console(List&lt;Keys&gt; keys)
        {
            clickNo ++;

            start = DateTime.Now;
            progressBar1.Maximum = 1;
            progressBar1.Step = 1;
            progressBar1.Value = 0;

            switch (clickNo)
            {
                case 1:
                    DoRequest(ScreenshotRequest.DannysCommands.NormalOperation); break;
                case 2:
                    DoRequest(ScreenshotRequest.DannysCommands.Displayoverlays); break;
                case 3:
                    DoRequest(ScreenshotRequest.DannysCommands.Dontdisplayoverlays); break;
            }

        }
</code></pre>

<p>clickNo is global int variable for the switch,case use.</p>

<p>The problem here is:</p>

<p>If the combination of keys are Left Ctrl + O i can't then type in a textBox when the program is running the letter O or if it's G i can't type G for some reason this event lock the key it can be pressed togeather with the Left Ctrl but i can't use it as single letter for example if i want to type in a textBox.</p>

<p>How can i fix this combination class event ?</p>

There are 3 basic classes that store arrays of pointers to one-another.</p>

<p>That's an attrib class with it's derived classed that specify type of attribute (int float vector3 string etc.) It's not solved to the point but I show how it looks now.</p>

<pre><code>class attrib
{
public:
    attrib(){};
    ~attrib(){};
    char name[CHAR_STRING_MAX_LENGTH];
    unsigned short name_length;
    attrib_types attrib_type;
    virtual int get_value_int(){return -1;}
    virtual float get_value_float(){return -1;}
    virtual void set_value(int _value){};
    virtual void set_value(float _value){};
    virtual void set_value(char * _value){};
    void set_name(char * attrib_name);
    virtual char *get_string_value_ptr(){return 0;}
    virtual char *get_digits_string_ptr(){return 0;}
};

class attr_int:public attrib
{
public:
    int value;
    attr_int(){attrib_type=ATTR_TYPE_INT;};
    attr_int(char * _name,int _value);
    ~attr_int(){};

    void set_value(int _value){value=_value;return;}
    int get_value_int(){return value;}
    char *get_digits_string_ptr();
};
</code></pre>

<p>The node class stores a list of pointers to attrib class(base). In derived classes theese attributes are listed explicitly but in base they still look like a list of attrib class pointers.</p>

<pre><code>class node
{
public:
    node();
    node(core::node_types _node_type);
    ~node(){};
    void init();
    //attributes
    core::attrib** attrib_list;
    unsigned short attrib_count;

    //base
    char name[64];
    unsigned short index;
    core::node_types node_type;
    POINT cp;
    DWORD id;
    node *input;
    mesh *mesh_ptr;
    bool has_hook_out,has_hook_in,is_mesh;
    RECT rect,rect_hook_out;
    void update_rect();
    virtual void update_mesh(){};
    void update_pos(POINT pt);
    void update_pos(short x,short y);

    virtual void build_mesh();
    };


class node_cube:public node
{
public:
    node_cube();
    node_cube(unsigned short x,unsigned short y,unsigned short z);
    ~node_cube();
    void build_mesh();
    void update_mesh();
    core::attr_int x_segments,y_segments,z_segments;

};
</code></pre>

<p>There is also a scene class that holds a list of node pointers..
When I choose a node and dblckick it I create my attribute editor, that creates EDIT controls for each of the attrib in nodes attrib_list. I aslo create a struct that holds attrib information inside attribute editor like that</p>

<pre><code>struct attrib_ui
{
    wchar_t label[32];
    HWND hwnd_label,hwnd_value;
    RECT rect_value;
    Cwindow_attrib_editor *pThis;
    core::attrib * attr;
};
attrib_ui *attrib_ui_list;
</code></pre>

<p>So all the attributes are also stored in an array that holds control information also.
To edit value the user is going to hold down MMB and drag inside the edit control.
During drag operation I show additional UI element that is stored in class</p>

<p>!!THE PROBLEM IS HERE (valuei):
Here is a code that reacts on WM_MOUSEMOVE message</p>

<pre><code>bool Cwindow_attrib_editor::callback_mousemove(attrib_ui * _lpinfo,LPARAM lParam)

    Scene-&gt;update_node_mesh(current_nd);
    SetWindowText(hWnd_edit,w_value_buffer);//AFTER THAT THE VALUE ATT VALUEI IS ZERO
    w_value_length=w_length(w_value_buffer);
    ScreenToClient(hWnd_menu,&amp;pt);
    update_active_rect(lParam);
    draw();
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, basicly the value at address valuei is correct after assignment. But after the execution of SetWindowText , it becomes 00.</p>

<p>I've found a strange corellation though in registers window.
There I'm watching at some EDO register, which I've failed to find in google.
So the rightmost byte corellates to the *value directly.
Here are screens for better understanding<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/HXdlX.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> 
If i just create int value and then assign 4 to that value instead of valuei then it works fine.
The valuei though is a complex pointer which I need to describe more.</p>

<p>![enter image description here][2]

<p>This is what is happening</p>

<p>1) When a user clicks on the link - the play-video php action is called which retrives the video url from database and passes so that it can be played on the popup window. This works fine.</p>

<p>2) Now the play-video also generates a unique id which is passed on to the page (iframe window) where the video is played. Right now I'm just displaying that value on the page. I can have that unique id stored as a hidden field or as a div value.</p>

<p>3) Now when the user closes this window - how can I access this unique id in the callback function of pretty photo which is in the main page.</p>

<p>Now problem is that even though I am setting different preferences based on contact's phone via <code>getSharedPreferences(phone, Context.MODE_PRIVATE)</code> but still when I go to any user's preference screen, it is always the same settings applied to all contacts :(</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest what I am doing wrong or how to set different preferences for items (contacts) of ListView so that each one will have different notification sound, notification icon etc for example ? Or any other approach that works is also welcome :)</p>

<p>Thanks for your help :)</p>

<p>When all column types of the DB source and Excel destination are DT_WSTR of max. 255 chars all works fine. But changing the input column of the Excel Destination (in Advanced properties) to  NTEXT causes package pre-processing errors <br/></p>

<p>This is regardless of what is the source for this column - directly the DT_WSTR from the database or DT_NTEXT from a Data Conversion task inserted in between.<br>

I've done the research to some same threads like <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1606004/linux-raw-socket-programming-question"">linux raw socket programming question</a>, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4442060/how-to-reproduce-tcp-protocol-3-way-handshake-with-raw-sockets-correctly"">How to reproduce TCP protocol 3-way handshake with raw sockets correctly?</a>,  and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6441739/tcp-ack-spoofing"">TCP ACK spoofing</a>, but still can't get the solution.</p>

<p>I try to make a server which don't listen to any port, but sniff SYN packets from remote hosts. After the server do some calculation, it will send back a SYN_ACK packet to corresponding SYN packet, so that I can create TCP Connection manually, without including kernel's operation. I've create raw socket and send the SYN_ACK over it, but the packet cannot get through to the remote host. When I tcpdump on the server (Ubuntu Server 10.04) and wireshark on client (windows 7), the server returns RST_ACK instead of my SYN_ACK packet. After doing some research, I got information that we cannot preempt kernel's TCP handling. </p>

<p>Is there still any other ways to hack or set the kernel not to responds RST_ACK to those packets? 
I've added a firewall to local ip of server to tell the kernel that maybe there's something behind the firewall which is waiting for the packet, but still no luck</p>

You can drag a picture from the list on the left hand side and drop them on the list in the middle. The lists can contain many pictures so I decided to add a scrollbar using slimScroll.js (v0.5) to get scrolling on those lists. 
When I drag an item from the list on the left hand side the item disappears behind the middle list. This has something to do with the implementation of the slimScroll plugin. </p>

<p>But I am finding the Picker UI to get out of sync...</p>

<p>I use the following code to remove myself:</p>

<pre><code>ABAddressBookRef addressBook = ABAddressBookCreate();
NSArray *people = (__bridge NSArray *) ABAddressBookCopyArrayOfAllPeople(addressBook);

NSMutableArray * recordsToRemoveArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc]init];

/* Here I decide which records we want to remove 
   and add them to the 'recordsToRemoveArray */

/* Finally, we iterate through the array of records to remove, 
   removing them from our copy of the address book: */
for (int l=0; l &lt; recordsToRemoveArray.count; l++) {
    ABRecordRef recToRemoveRef = (__bridge ABRecordRef)([recordsToRemoveArray objectAtIndex:l]);

    ABAddressBookRemoveRecord(addressBook, recToRemoveRef, nil);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, I am finding that the contacts get out of sync with the 'Letter section'</p>

<p>This only happens if I am the only contact in the section.</p>

<p>E.g. Bob Smith is removed from the Letter 'S' section, but the Picker still shows the 'S' Section, but with the next sections contacts in it!</p>

<p>Anyone know how to avoid this? I haven't found a remove section api or a way to force update the ABAddressBook.</p>

<p>I want to add a function to the form that allows users to upload a picture as there avatar, and also be able to crop the image to our specified dimensions. </p>

<p>I am trying to implement the jquery plugin <a href=""http://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropper/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropper/</a> within this form. I am using the demo code located at the bottom of that page. This code creates a modal window where the user can upload there image, crop as required and then click done to upload the file to the server. </p>

<p>The problem I have is that the code from the cropper site creates a form within the modal window, which is located inside the already existing form on the site where the user enters there details. I realise you can't have a form within a form and this means when the user uploads the image in the modal window and then clicks ""done"" it saves both forms at the same time. </p>

<p>How would I go about putting this modal window within this user form? I hope this all makes sense, but I think my logic is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click avatar button</li>
<li>Load modal window</li>
<li>User selects image to upload. </li>
<li>User chooses how to crop image. </li>
<li>User clicks done in modal window and image is uploaded to server. And modal window closes</li>
<li>User fills in rest of user form and data is sent to database along with the new url for the image that they just uploaded. </li>
</ol>

<p>Could somebody point me in the right direction or give me any tips on what I'm missing?</p>

When I look at the website on an Ipad, it is resizing a background image and making it smaller than everything else. I have noticed that mobile devices resize content so that it fits on the small screen when zoomed in, so I'm assumimg that is what's happening here, and that because everything in the section that is being resized has an absolute position, nothing else is resizing with the parent. My question is, how do i force that section tag with the background image to not resize and to stay the same.</p>

<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3140017/how-to-programmatically-select-selectables-with-jquery-ui"">How to programmatically select selectables with jQuery UI?</a></p>

<p>The select all button works perfectly up to the point of the ._mouseStop command, and then it just spits out the error: </p>

<pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method '_mouseStop' of undefined 
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the relevant part of the code:</p>

<p>Step 1: There are four lists on this page, and all four of them are using the selectable plugin</p>

<pre><code>//Make all four lists selectable
$(""#selectNewTweets"").selectable();
$(""#selectApprovedTweets"").selectable();
$(""#selectDeclinedTweets"").selectable();
$(""#selectUndecidedTweets"").selectable();
</code></pre>

<p>Step 2: Mass-register all the ""Select All"" buttons (one for each list)</p>

<pre><code>//click a ""Select All"" button
$(""[id^=btnSelectAll]"").click(function(e){
    var id = $(this).attr('id');
    var list = id.substring(
        ""btnSelectAll"".length,
        id.length);
    //select all elements in target list
    $(""#select""+list+""Tweets &gt; li"").each(function(index){
        $(this).removeClass('ui-selected');
        $(this).addClass(""ui-selecting"");
    });

    $(""#select""+list+""Tweets"").data(""selectable"")._mouseStop(null);
});
</code></pre>

<p>When I click any of the ""Select All"" buttons, the elements inside all get the ""ui-selecting"" class, so the .each() statement is working perfectly. However, once it reaches the ._mouseStop() line, it throws the exception I mentioned above.</p>

<p>Any ideas what's causing the exception?</p>

For this I have made my own subclass of Tab, EditableTab, which has functionality for changing the name of the tab by double clicking on the name in the overview. When the user clicks the + sign to create a new contact list, I want the program to create a new tab, select it, then focus the name and select all the text - it is natural to name the contact list at once (similar to when you create a new file in windows). </p>

<p>My problem: This seems to be very unstable. Most of the times, it seems some kind of animation/transition problem arises, and the tab name ends up empty. Here is a screenshot of what <em>usually, but not always,</em> happens when the + button is clicked: <img src=""http://i.imgur.com/YNxKilt.jpg"" alt=""screenshot""></p>

<p>And here is what I want: <img src=""http://i.imgur.com/V1nRmPS.jpg"" alt=""screenshot2""></p>

<p>Here is the code for my EditableTab:</p>

<pre><code>public class EditableTab extends Tab {

private Label lbl;
private TextField txtField;

public EditableTab(String text, Node content) {
    super();
    setContent(content);
    lbl = new Label(text);
    txtField = new TextField(text);
    txtField.setStyle(""-fx-background-color: transparent"");
    setGraphic(lbl);
    setupInteractivity();
}

public TextField getTextField() {
    return txtField;
}

private void setupInteractivity() {
    lbl.setOnMouseClicked((mouseEvent) -&gt; {
        if (mouseEvent.getClickCount() == 2) {
            showTextField();
        }
    });

    txtField.setOnAction(event -&gt; setGraphic(lbl));

    txtField.focusedProperty().addListener(
            (observable, oldValue, newValue) -&gt; {
        if (! newValue) {
            lbl.setText(txtField.getText());
            setGraphic(lbl);
        }
    });
}

public void showTextField() {
    txtField.setPrefWidth(lbl.getWidth());
    txtField.setText(lbl.getText());
    setGraphic(txtField);
    txtField.selectAll();
    txtField.requestFocus();
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>And here is the code where the functionality is implemented:</p>

<pre><code>private void addNewContactlist() {
    Contactlist newList = new Contactlist();
    newList.setName(""New contact list"");
    contactlistApp.getContactlistData().add(newList);
    ListView&lt;Person&gt; lv = new ListView&lt;Person&gt;(newList.getContacts());
    setupListView(lv);
    int position = tabPane.getTabs().size() - 1;
    EditableTab tab = createEditableTab(""New contact list"", lv);
    tabPane.getTabs().add(position, tab);
    tabPane.getSelectionModel().select(tab);
    tab.showTextField();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I suspect that the problem comes from some animation/transition timings, but that is really just a guess. I tried wrapping the <code>showTextField()</code> call in a <code>Platform.runLater()</code> with no luck.</p>

<p>Here is a small test app to replicate the issue:</p>

<pre><code>public class TestApp extends Application {

    addNewContactlistTab.setClosable(false);

<p>Generating PNGs from PDF pages and showing them in a ListView through an ImageList</p>

<p>Desired behaviour:</p>

<p>When the user chooses another file to be displayed in the listview -> clear both the ImageList and ListView items (obvious) and also delete the generated image files.</p>

<p>Issue: </p>

<p>Exception thrown on delete: ""The process cannot access the file 'X.png' because it is being used by another process.""</p>

<pre><code>previewImageList.Images.Clear();

{                
  Directory.Delete(folderToDelete, true);  // Image file ""X.png"" is used by another process
}
catch (Exception)
{}
</code></pre>

<p>Solution found:
- calling the Garbage Collector manually before deleting the said PNG files seems to do the trick. </p>

<pre><code>previewImageList.Images.Clear();
previewListView.Items.Clear();    

string folderToDelete = Path.Combine(outputFolder, Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(selectedSong));

try
{
  GC.Collect();
  GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();

  Directory.Delete(folderToDelete, true);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
  MessageBox.Show(ex.Message);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>But</strong> <em>as i researched</em> so far it isn't a good thing to do.
Do I have an alternative to calling the Garbage collector?
The reason I need to delete the PNGs is to be able to reuse respective filename with a PDF from another path...</p>

<p>The closest I got to are <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15219407/where-is-the-proper-place-to-dispose-an-image/"">here</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10634512/winforms-and-disposing-custom-controls"">here</a> but didn't help much.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT additional details</strong>
Generating the PNGs: 
- i use <a href=""http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows"" rel=""nofollow"">ImageMagik</a> like this:</p>

In the documentation, an example call (which I confirmed works) in command line curl is:</p>

<pre><code>curl 'http://rest.ensembl.org/vep/homo_sapiens/region' -H 'Content-type:application/json' \
-H 'Accept:application/json' -X POST -d '{ ""variants"" : [""21  26960070  rs116645811 G A . . ."", ""21  26965148  rs1135638 G A . . ."" ] }'
</code></pre>

<p>My attempt at replicating this in php curl is:</p>

<pre><code>$session = curl_init();
curl_setopt($session, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt($session, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
curl_setopt($session, CURLOPT_URL,'http://rest.ensembl.org/vep/homo_sapiens/region');
curl_setopt($session, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(""Content-Type"" =&gt; ""application/json"", ""Accept"" =&gt; ""application/json""));
curl_setopt($session, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, '{ ""variants"" : [""21  26960070  rs116645811 G A . . ."", ""21  26965148  rs1135638 G A . . ."" ] }');
echo(curl_exec($session));
curl_close($session);
</code></pre>

<p>The result I get is:</p>

<p>{""error"":"" Cannot find \""variants\"" key in your POST. Please check the format of your message against the documentation""}</p>

<p>The problem seems to be with the CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, but since the required argument appears to simply be a string and I am using the same string, I cannot tell how it is going wrong.</p>

<pre><code> ALTER TABLE dbo.Reservation ADD ConfirmationID UNIQUEIDENTIFIER  DEFAULT (NEWID()) WITH VALUES
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever I create a new row in this table, the <code>NEWID()</code> is always set to <code>00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000</code>. I have tried to create a new Guid for the property in C# before my insert, however this returns the same result. </p>

<p>Here is the C# code I am calling as part of the insert function:</p>

<pre><code>public ReservationClientModel Create(ReservationClientModel clientModel)
    {
        var reservation = new Reservation();
        reservation = Mapper.Map&lt;ReservationClientModel, Reservation&gt;(clientModel, reservation);
        reservation.ConfirmationID = new Guid();

        _repository.Add(reservation);

        _context.Commit();

        return Mapper.Map&lt;ReservationClientModel&gt;(reservation);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code generated from EF as seen from EF Profiler:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT [dbo].[Reservation]
   ([RoomID],
    .....
    .....
    [ConfirmationID])

VALUES (15 /* @0 - [ID] */,
    .... 
    ....
    '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' /* @13 - [ConfirmationID] */)
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way I can set this property to add a <code>NEWID()</code> on insert, without setting the property in C# before hand?</p>

<p>Let's assume we have following model:</p>

<pre><code>class Transport(models.Model):
    start_area = models.ForeignKey(Area, related_name='starting_transports')
    finish_area = models.ForeignKey(Area, related_name='finishing_transports')

<p>Now, what I would like to do is to make admin filter which allows for filtering of in-area and trans-area objects, where in-area are those, whose start_area and finish_area are the same and trans-area are the others.</p>

<p>I have tried to accomplish this by creating custom FilterSpec but there are two problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>FilterSpec is bound to only one field.</li>
<li>FilterSpec doesn't support F() expressions and exclude.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second problem might be solved by defining custom ChangeList class, but I see no way to solve the first one.</p>

<p>I also tried to ""emulate"" the filter straight in the ModelAdmin instance by overloading queryset method and sending extra context to the changelist template where the filter itself would be hard-coded and printed by hand. Unfortunately, there seems to be problem, that Django takes out my GET parameters (used in filter link) as they are unknown to the ModelAdmin instance and instead, it puts only ?e=1 which is supposed to signal some error.</p>

<p>Thanks anyone in advance.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: It seems that functionality, which would allow for this is planned for next Django release, see <a href=""http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5833"">http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5833</a>. Still, does someone have a clue how to accomplish that in Django 1.2?</p>

Once their location has been retrieved their location is plotted on a map (the parent route). They can then choose to view a list of tweets that were posted around that location (the child route).</p>

<p>So, I need to pass the coordinates I retrieved at the parent route (which are stored on the controller) to the child route so I can query the Twitter API properly. However, I am unsure how to do this or even if I've chosen the best approach.</p>

<p>This is the index controller:</p>

<pre><code>App.IndexController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({

  coords: false,

  getGeoLocation: function() {
    if (navigator.geolocation) {
        this.set('retrieving', true);
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
            this.locationRetrieved.bind(this),
            this.locationFailed.bind(this),
            {
                timeout: 20000
            }
        );
    } else {
        this.set('geolocation', false);
    }
  },

  locationRetrieved: function(position) {
    this.set('coords', position.coords);
    this.get('target').transitionTo('what-do-you-want-to-know');
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The WhatDoYouWantToKnow controller ""needs"" the index controller:</p>

<pre><code>App.WhatDoYouWantToKnowController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({

  needs: 'index',

  createMap: function() {
    var coords = this.get('controllers.index').get('coords');
    var pyrmont = new google.maps.LatLng(coords.latitude, coords.longitude);

    var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {
        mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP,
        center: pyrmont,
        zoom: 8
    });

    var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
        map: map,
        position: pyrmont
    });
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This route has a template which links to the '/what-do-you-want-to-know/tweets' route:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Your location:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=""map""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;{{#linkTo 'tweets'}}Tweets{{/linkTo}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I then need to pass these coords onto the child route:</p>

<pre><code>App.TweetsRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
   model: function() {
    return App.Tweet.find({coords:});
  }
});

<p>Using <a href=""https://github.com/LaTtEX/MyTreeViewPrototype"" rel=""nofollow"">this code</a> for a nested UITableView, implement adding and reordering of rows.</p>

<h1>Where I Am At</h1>

<p>Using <a href=""https://github.com/shusta/ReorderingTableViewController"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> combined with the previous code, I'm able to move around rows but I haven't figured out how to properly insert and delete rows. </p>

<h1>Plan</h1>

<p>The initial data structure is made like this:</p>

<pre><code>    treeNode = [[MyTreeNode alloc] initWithValue:@""Root""];
    MyTreeNode *node1 = [[MyTreeNode alloc] initWithValue:@""Node1""];
    [treeNode addChild:node1];

    MyTreeNode *node1a = [[MyTreeNode alloc] initWithValue:@""Node1a""];
    MyTreeNode *node1b = [[MyTreeNode alloc] initWithValue:@""Node1b""];
    [node1 addChild:node1a];
    [node1 addChild:node1b];

    MyTreeNode *node1a1 = [[MyTreeNode alloc] initWithValue:@""Node1a1""];
    [node1a addChild:node1a1];

    MyTreeNode *node1b1 = [[MyTreeNode alloc] initWithValue:@""Node1b1""];
    MyTreeNode *node1b2 = [[MyTreeNode alloc] initWithValue:@""Node1b2""];
    MyTreeNode *node1b3 = [[MyTreeNode alloc] initWithValue:@""Node1b3""];

    [node1b addChild:node1b1];
    [node1b addChild:node1b2];
    [node1b addChild:node1b3];
    node1b.inclusive = NO;

    MyTreeNode *node2 = [[MyTreeNode alloc] initWithValue:@""Node2""];
    [treeNode addChild:node2];

    MyTreeNode *node2a = [[MyTreeNode alloc] initWithValue:@""Node2a""];
    [node2 addChild:node2a];

    MyTreeNode *node2a1 = [[MyTreeNode alloc] initWithValue:@""Node2a1""];
    [node2a addChild:node2a1];
</code></pre>

<p>and as I see it, for reordering rows the process will be something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creat a new instance of <code>MyTreeNode</code> for the moved row, using <code>fromIndexPath</code>.</li>
<li>Create a new instance of <code>MyTreeNode</code> for the row above where the moved row is to be inserted, using <code>toIndexPath</code>.</li>
<li>Add to each other the two above instances using using some sort of <code>addObject:object toParent:parent</code> type of method.</li>
</ol>

<p>and for just adding rows, I imagine the process should be fairly similar.</p>

<h1>Questions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Is the above plan the correct way to go about the problem, and if so, what is the correct way to go about making the <code>addObject:object toParent:parent</code> method?</li>
<li>When reordering, how can I prevent the higher level sections from being inserted into lower level sections? Ex: not allowing a heading to be inserted under a sub-heading.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>I have been trying to create a zip file using <strong>zipfile</strong> in Python, but it keeps zipping all folders that are included in the absolute path. I just want to zip the file that the path leads to, not all of the files in that path.</p>

<p>If I try to create a zip file named ""Zip_Files.zip"" from this path:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C:\Users\UserName\Documents\Folder_to_be_zipped\</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I try to zip this I end up with a zip folder like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Users -> UserName -> Documents -> Folder_to_be_zipped</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Zip_Files.zip -> Folder_to_be_zipped</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I only want to zip <strong>Folder_to_be_zipped</strong>, not every file leading to that folder.</p>

<p>If someone could write the code needed to make this work and explain what the code is doing. I have had issues understanding the responses on similiar questions and that is why I am asking the question again.</p>

zip = zipfile.ZipFile('Zipper.zip', 'w')

second_path = ""C:/Users/Andrew/Documents/Test""

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(second_path):
  zip.write(second_path, basename(second_path))
  zip.close()

<p>When I use annotations, I have the class and its configuration together but with an xml I get a bigger picture of my system because I can see all class-configurations.</p>

<p>Annotations also get compiled in some way I guess and it should be quicker than parsing the xml, but on the other hand, if I want to change my configuration I have to recompile it instead of just changing the xml file (which might become even more handy for production environments on customer side).</p>

<p>So, when looking at my points, I tend to go the xml-way. But when looking at forums or tutorials usually annotations are used.</p>

So, I've watched Brett Slatkin's Google IO videos (2008 &amp; 2009) about building scalable apps including <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgaL6NGpkB8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgaL6NGpkB8</a> and read the docs but as a n00b, I'm still not sure.</p>

<p>I'm trying to build an app on GAEJ similar to the original 'hotornot' where a user is presented with an item which they rate. Once they rate it, they are presented with another one which they haven't seen before.<br>
My question is this; is it most efficient to do a query up front to grab x items (say 100) and put them in a list (stored in memcache?) or is it better to simply make a query for a new item after each rating.<br>
To keep track of the items a user has seen, I'm planning to keep those items' keys in a list property of the user's entity. Does that sound sensible?</p>

<p>I've really got myself confused about this so any help would be much appreciated.</p>

Unfortunately, I cannot use <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.readerwriterlockslim%28v=vs.110%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>ReaderWriterLockSlim</code></a> because of what seems like a pretty big synchronization bug that may lead to deadlocks on certain hardware. <a href=""http://chabster.blogspot.com/2013/12/readerwriterlockslim-fails-on-dual.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This article</a> explains the problem in great detail.</p>

<p>The above issue seems to be fixed in .NET Framework 4.0.30319.33440 but not all Windows server versions get this fix. Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 have the fix. Windows Server 2012 (not R2) and Windows Server 2008 R2 still have the bug, even after the latest patches. It looks like Microsoft doesn't plan on fixing this problem on all platforms.</p>

<p>Our various server environments use different versions of Windows Server and I've confirmed that some servers have the fix, while some don't. This means that I cannot safely change all those <code>lock</code> statements to reader-writer locks because on some of our servers the application may deadlock randomly.</p>

<p>As an alternative, I'm looking into reimplementing <code>ReaderWriterLockSlim</code> by decompiling the code in System.Core and creating a new class (something like <code>MyRWLock</code>) that has the one (known) buggy function <code>ExitMyLock</code> fixed. All other code is the same as the original <code>ReaderWriterLockSlim</code>.</p>

<p>This requires the removal of all <code>__DynamicallyInvokable</code> attributes and the addition of 2 or 3 classes / structures that are internal to <code>System.Core</code>. I did all this and have the new lock class compiles without errors.</p>

<p>My question is: can anyone think of any reason that this new class wouldn't work as the original <code>ReaderWriterLockSlim</code> class does? I consider myself fairly good when it comes to threading but I'm not an expert. Since I didn't change any code (other than fixing some type names to point to the new <code>MyRWLock</code> instead of <code>ReaderWriterLockSlim</code> and the attributes), I believe this should work. I do wonder, however, if I forgot about something that may break this in various interesting ways that are hard to debug.</p>

<p>Alternatively: is my (and the linked article's) understanding wrong? Does this problem not need fixing in the first place? The author of that article seems to have done a very detailed analysis which looks correct to me and yet Microsoft didn't apply the change to certain Windows Server versions.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on this would be much appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: </p>

<p>To add more context for the full locks, here's what they are for. We have a service that reads / writes a remote service when it performs its work. There are many more reads than writes. A read involves 1 network roundtrip and a write involves 3 network roundtrips to the remote service. When a write happens, no read may happen (the write is really a read->delete->add). Right now, we use full <code>lock</code>-s around all of these operations but this means that all the threads that try to read still have to queue up until the current read finishes, even without a write. It seems to me that an RW lock would be ideal for this.</p>

FQDN is the fully qualified server name and the services are the list of services I want to check on the remote server.</p>

<p>I'll start with:</p>

<pre><code>$LIST = &lt;CALL to Module function to populate the server information&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Next is the call to the invoke-command</p>

<pre><code>Invoke-Command -ComputerName $LIST.FQDN -ScriptBlock { 
Write-Host ""Working on $($env:ComputerName)"" 
    Get-Service
}
</code></pre>

<p>But what I need to do is pass the list of services that correspond to -ComputerName.  I know I can use the -ArgumentList and I've tried:</p>

<pre><code>Invoke-Command -ComputerName $LIST.FQDN -ScriptBlock { 
    Param ([string[]] $ServiceList)
    Write-Host ""Working on $($env:ComputerName)""
    ($ServiceList -split("","")).trim() | %{ 
        $svc =Get-Service $_ 
        $Svc
    }
} -ArgumentList $LIST.Services
</code></pre>

<p>But this passes a list of all the services for every server. I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>$LIST | %{
    $Server = $_

    Invoke-Command -ComputerName $Server.FQDN -ScriptBlock { 
        Param ([string[]] $ServiceList)

            $Svc
        }
    } -ArgumentList $($Server.SERVICES)
}

<p>But then I loose the advantage of parallelism of the invoke-command CmdLet.</p>

<p>This should work like I select Product, based on its value, the models are populated from 
<code>NewFile.jsp</code>. This is working fine. In  <code>NewFile.jsp</code>, on selecting the model, the price is to be populated using the values <code>selProduct</code> and <code>selModel</code>. When I am running <code>NewFile.jsp</code>, this price is getting populated but when I am running <code>mainFile.jsp</code>, <code>selModel</code> is being passed as <code>null</code> to <code>selPrice.jsp</code> from <code>NewFile.jsp</code>. So I am getting stuck there.I might be doing something wrong here but I am unable to spot it. So any help would be great here.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

a project with many social relations and many other things which 
can easily be represented by a graph.</p>

<p>Graph-Databases are much faster so I started thinking about it.</p>

<p>However, I have a Java Enterprise Web Application and I have been using
(until now) a relational MySQL Database with JPA.</p>

<p>Now my question: Is there already the same JPA functionallity
for Graph-Databases like there is for relational Databases?</p>

<p>My first attempt involved applying the sort in the foreach data-binding.<br>
<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/wnfXV/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/wnfXV/</a></p>

<p><code>&lt;ul data-bind=""foreach: people.sort(function(l,r) { return l.name == r.name ? 0 : (l.name &lt; r.name ? -1 : 1)})""&gt;</code></p>

<p>This performs the proper sorting, but I lose the ability to dynamically add/remove elements from the array and have the DOM update.</p>

<p>If I add a set of parenthesis to access the underlying JavaScript array, everything works fine. </p>

<p><code>&lt;ul data-bind=""foreach: people().sort(function(l,r) { return l.name == r.name ? 0 : (l.name &lt; r.name ? -1 : 1)})""&gt;</code></p>

<p>Based on some SO answers I found, I ended up creating a computed observable for the sorted array. 
<a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/wnfXV/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/wnfXV/2/</a></p>

<pre><code>self.sortedPeople = ko.computed(function() {
    return self.people().sort(function(l,r) {
        return l.name == r.name ? 0 : (l.name &lt; r.name ? -1 : 1);
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>This also works. And I don't even need to data-bind to the computed observable since it is executed immediately. I can push and remove array items and the DOM updates appropriately.</p>

<p>However, if I change the code to:</p>

<pre><code>self.sortedPeople = ko.computed(function() {
    return self.people.sort(function(l,r) {
        return l.name == r.name ? 0 : (l.name &lt; r.name ? -1 : 1);
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I am able to push items to the array and the DOM updates, but the data is not being sorted. </p>

<p>I think these differences are related to knockout dependency tracking, and the difference between operating on an observable array and the native JavaScript array underneath it, but I'm having a hard time conceptualizing why the behavior is changing. I am able to get it to work, but I'm also curious as to what is considered best practice.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help. :)</p>

Of course C++ is much faster than Python, in general, but does that necessarily mean that you should prefer to execute C++ code over Python code as often as possible?</p>

<p>I'm asking this because I'm not sure, is there any performance cost of switching control between code written in C++ and code written in Python? Should I use code written in C++ on every occasion, or should I avoid calling back to C++ for simple tasks because any speed gain you might have from executing C++ code is outmatched by the cost of switching between languages?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I should make this clear, I'm not asking this to actually solve a problem. I'm asking purely out of curiosity and it's something worth keeping in mind for the future. So I'm not interested in alternative solutions, I just want to know the answer, from a technical standpoint. :) </p>

<p>So far, so good. I can quickly create a ""Browse..."" button in XAML. <strong>However</strong>, I can't get the <code>TextBoxDependency</code> working in the way that I was hoping it would work.</p>

<p>What I want to be able to do is something like this (XAML):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextBox x:Name=""MyTextBox"" /&gt;
&lt;extensions:BrowseButton TextBox=""MyTextBox"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I drop that in it says this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The TypeConverter for ""TextBox"" does not support converting from a string.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there some way to accomplish what I want to do here? To effectively reference another XAML element inside of a XAML element, without having to leave XAML to do it?</p>

Heres his modified version that I prefer: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/5cp1repe/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">JSFiddle</a></p>

<p>So my question is, how could I make the contents inside an iframe (after being adjusted using the solution) be automatically and proportionally scaled based off the iframes width and height? When I mean contents, I mean everything inside of it such as images, texts, etc.</p>

<p>After researching, I stumbled upon an attribute that may solve my problem, but after using it with the solution, it had no effect.</p>

<p>Style/CSS Attribute(s):<br>
<code>-ms-zoom: 0.75;</code>
<code>-moz-transform: scale(0.75);</code>
<code>-moz-transform-origin: 0 0;</code>
<code>-o-transform: scale(0.75);</code>
<code>-o-transform-origin: 0 0;</code>
<code>-webkit-transform: scale(0.75);</code>
<code>-webkit-transform-origin: 0 0;</code></p>

<p>It seems to me that the effect only takes action when the width and height are left alone. I'm trying to achieve the zoom effect used in the attribute so I don't dynamically interfere with the contents inside.</p>

<p>Do I have to use Javascript to achieve this? I've been stuck on this problem for about a week and can't seem to find a solution.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: I do understand the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy"" rel=""nofollow"">Same-origin policy</a> when it comes to using external sites within the iframe. I'm NOT interested in loading content from external sources.</strong> </p>

By ""content type"", I mean something that behaves a lot like a Page object i.e. has a URL, title, plugins etc, but also has additional custom fields.</p>

<p>I looked at <a href=""http://ilian.i-n-i.org/extending-django-cms-page-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ilian.i-n-i.org/extending-django-cms-page-model/</a>, which is almost perfect, except that it just adds extra fields to the existing Page class. So if you wanted two new content types such as Event (extra fields: start_date, end_date) and Venue (extra fields: latitude, longitude), every time you added a Page you would see the fields for both of these content types, even if you only wanted to create an Event or a Venue (or even just a standard Page).</p>

<p>Have a problem that I've been mulling over for a bit here - we have a dropdown box in our html/javascript (legacy, no JQuery yet) front end that displays a list of textual elements like so:</p>

<ul>
<li>Total capacity &lt; 500ml</li>
<li>Total capacity 500ml - 1L</li>
<li>Total capacity 1L - 2L</li>
<li>Total capacity > 2L</li>
</ul>

<p>In our Java model, we have the capacity of an item stored - so we know that CokeBottle is 600.00f capacity etc.</p>

<p>My question is, without remodeling the dropdown objects to be more than just strings, how could I best automatically choose the correct capacity for an item when it is selected elsewhere? So that when the page is loaded for CokeBottle, it knows to choose ""Total capacity 500ml - 1L"" by default?</p>

<p>Regular expressions would be one way of doing this, but it seems brittle and a bit confusing to maintain going forward. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm also happy to consider a filter approach - removing those items that dont qualify, as sometimes we will have up to twenty elements in these dropdowns - so anything we can do to reduce the manual work of a user will be welcome.</p>

I'm passing these user model preferences to the server, so when the user logs back in, they are stored. They work fine, however my radio button selection isn't being stored for some reason, even though I'm doing it in the same way as the other elements. If I check a selection, it reverts back to default on refresh. </p>

<p>From what I can tell by trying to debug it in console, it seems as though the radio button attribute is being saved, so I'm unsure why it isn't working. Hope I've explained this clearly enough. If anyone could help me solve this problem it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>If i were using HTML format in the django template, I would use:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#{{group.name}}""&gt; {{group.name}} &lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But I can't find the correct syntax using jade format.</p>

<p>What I have is:</p>

<pre><code>table.generic
  tbody
    tr
      th Jump to a Group
    {% for group in groups %}
    tr
      td
        a(href!='#{{group.name}}') {{group.name}}
    {% endfor %}
</code></pre>

<p>But the anchors are rendered in HTML as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a +{group.name.__str__()+'}'="""" href=""""&gt;Registration&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>""Registration"" is a value for group.name.</p>

<p>Removing the <code>!</code> causes a django render error.</p>

<p>I tried to insert a backslash: <code>a(href!='#\{{group.name}}') {{group.name}}</code>, but this renders with the backslash intact as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#\Registration""&gt;Registration&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Suggestions?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As a terrible work-around, I have added a ""pound"" method to return the group name with a <code>#</code> prefix:</p>

<pre><code>def pound(self): 
    return unicode(""#"" + self.name)
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can reference {{group.pound}} in the jade template:</p>

<pre><code>a(href!='{{group.pound}}') {{group.name}}
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe a better method name would be group.name_as_id_tag .... </p>

<h2>RESOLVED: Format the django template variable as a jade variable</h2>

<p>Based on the last suggestion from @user1737909, I extended the suggestion to try:</p>

<pre><code>a(href='##{group.name}') {{group.name}}
</code></pre>

<p>The key is to format the double-curly django variable <code>{{}}</code> as pound-single-curly jade variable <code>#{}</code>.  Do not include the <code>!</code> before the <code>=</code> sign so the variable <em>is</em> evaluated by jade which will insert the value it gets from django.</p>

<p>I wish I could find a link to a coding style reference page to include here.  But if I had one, I would not have asked this question in the first place.</p>

Any better place to store local data? Or I need SQLite? For example, my app writes all crash messages in <code>error.txt</code>, obviously I can't use sqlite in this case, and if I put <code>error.txt</code> in LocalState folder, users may already uninstalled the app, before I go to him to see what's in <code>error.txt</code>.

<p>To show what can go <em>wrong</em>, I've created the following code, which passes a single value as an <em>argument</em> to <code>Hash.new</code>. I expected all outer hash keys to wind up holding a reference to the same inner hash, causing the counts for the ""piles"" to get mixed together. And indeed, that does seem to have happened. But <code>part_counts.each</code> doesn't seem to find any keys/values to iterate over, and <code>part_counts.keys</code> returns an empty array. Only <code>part_counts[0]</code> and <code>part_counts[1]</code> successfully retrieve a value for me.</p>

<pre><code>piles = [
  [:gear, :spring, :gear],
  [:axle, :gear, :spring],
]

# I do realize this should be:
#   Hash.new {|h, k| h[k] = Hash.new(0)}
part_counts = Hash.new(Hash.new(0))

piles.each_with_index do |pile, pile_index|
  pile.each do |part|
    part_counts[pile_index][part] += 1
  end
end

p part_counts # =&gt; {}
p part_counts.keys # =&gt; []
# The next line prints no output
part_counts.each { |key, value| p key, value }
p part_counts[0] # =&gt; {:gear=&gt;3, :spring=&gt;2, :axle=&gt;1}
</code></pre>

<p>For context, here is the corrected code that I intend to show after the ""broken"" code. The parts for each pile within <code>part_counts</code> are separated, as they should be. <code>each</code> and <code>keys</code> work as expected, as well.</p>

<pre><code># ...same pile initialization code as above...
part_counts = Hash.new {|h, k| h[k] = Hash.new(0)}
# ...same part counting code as above...
p part_counts # =&gt; {0=&gt;{:gear=&gt;2, :spring=&gt;1}, 1=&gt;{:axle=&gt;1, :gear=&gt;1, :spring=&gt;1}}
p part_counts.keys # =&gt; [0, 1]
# The next line of code prints:
# 0
# {:gear=&gt;2, :spring=&gt;1}
# 1
# {:axle=&gt;1, :gear=&gt;1, :spring=&gt;1}
part_counts.each { |key, value| p key, value }
p part_counts[0] # =&gt; {:gear=&gt;2, :spring=&gt;1}
</code></pre>

<p>But why don't <code>each</code> and <code>keys</code> work (at all) in the first sample?</p>

This means I need to use appropriate math libraries (corresponding to the scalar type <code>T</code>) within the class. Here's the code as it is now:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class T&gt;
class MyType&lt;T&gt;
{
    private:
        std::vector&lt;T&gt; list;

    // ...

        template&lt;class U&gt; friend const UTP&lt;U&gt; sin(const UTP&lt;U&gt;&amp; a);
        template&lt;class U&gt; friend const UTP&lt;U&gt; cos(const UTP&lt;U&gt;&amp; a);
        template&lt;class U&gt; friend const UTP&lt;U&gt; tan(const UTP&lt;U&gt;&amp; a);

    //...
};

template&lt;class T&gt; const UTP&lt;T&gt; sin(const UTP&lt;T&gt;&amp; a)
{
   // use the sin(..) appropriate for type T here 
   // if T were double I want to use double std::sin(double)
   // if T were BigNum I want to use BigNum somelib::bigtype::sin(BigNum)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, I have code that exposes the appropriate math library (using namespace std;) and then use <code>::sin(a)</code> inside the sin function for my class <code>MyType</code>. While this works, it seems like a major hack.</p>

<p>I see that C++ traits can be used to store instance specific information (like which set of math functions to use when <code>T</code> is <code>double</code>, when <code>T</code> is <code>BigNum</code>, etc..)</p>

<p>I want to do something like this: (I know this doesn't compile but I hope this conveys what I want to do)</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;T&gt;
struct MyType_traits {
};

template&lt;&gt;
struct MyType_traits&lt;double&gt; {
    namespace math = std;
};

template&lt;&gt;
struct MyType_traits&lt;BigNum&gt; {
    namespace math = somelib::bigtype;
};
</code></pre>

<p>and then in redefine my MyType class as:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;T, traits = MyType_traits&lt;T&gt; &gt;
class MyType
{
// ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then use <code>traits::math::sin</code> in my friend function. Is there a way in which I can obtain the correct namespace (parameterized by <code>T</code>) containing the math functions?</p>

things I possibly understand:<br>
1)dynmap plugin uses server-side .js scripts to JSON.stringify the data that you send.<br>
2)said 'data' is <br><code>'{""name"":+JSON.stringify(pname?pname:"" "")+',""message"": '+JSON.stringify(message)+'}';</code><br>
3) it might be possible to HTTP PUSH straight into the <code>&lt;div&gt;chatinput&lt;/div&gt;</code><br>
4)I've found out about <code>xmlhttprequest</code><br><br>

<p>And that textarea does this upon focusing your mouse out of it, the texarea gets read line by line and each line looks for its delimeter ""|"" and then splits it up and divides that in home and away scorer.</p>

<p>Here's a JS fiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/cu24k/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/cu24k/</a></p>

<p>I could easily do it so if it's above 10, to scrap the last 4 characters of "" XX'"" and 3 do "" X'"" and split that up and color/bold it. But then I realized, what if they scored more than once? It would be <code>23', 45'</code> or longer!</p>

<p>So, I thought... what if I can just take apart any apostrophe, comma and number and color/bold that.</p>

<p>Is there a way?</p>

<p>I'm connecting to 2 MySQL database schemas on the same server: my_schema_1 and my_schema_2. Most of the data I need comes from my_schema_1, but one of its tables contains a column that references one of the tables in my_schema_2.</p>

<p>Here are my datasource definitions in my Datasources.groovy file (simplified):</p>

<pre><code>datasources = {
    datasource(name: 'my_schema_1') {
        domainClasses([Question, Answer])
        driverClassName('com.mysql.jdbc.Driver')
        url('jdbc:mysql://test.myserver.com/my_schema_1')
        username('***')
        password('***')
    }

    datasource(name: 'my_schema_2') {
        domainClasses([Genre])
        driverClassName('com.mysql.jdbc.Driver')
        url('jdbc:mysql://test.myserver.com/my_schema_2')
        username('***')
        password('***')
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here are my 3 class definitions:</p>

<pre><code>class Question {
    String text
    Answer answer
    Genre genre
}

class Answer {
    String text
}

class Genre {
    String name
}
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever I try to perform a criteria query on the Question class, I get the following mapping exception:</p>

<pre><code>An association from the table question refers to an unmapped class: Genre
</code></pre>

<p>If I comment out the genre property in the Question class, everything works fine. If I perform a criteria query on the Genre class itself,
everything works fine. There just seems to be a problem joining the 2 classes across schemas. (Of course, it's also very possible I missed
something or did something incorrectly.)</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong or is this a limitation of the datasources plugin? And, if this is a limitation of the plugin, what alternatives could I use to achieve what I need?</p>

<p>Any help/suggestions are much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<pre><code>var posts = [{

  Title: ""Coats save lives"",
  Author: { Name: ""blogger"" },

  PostDate: new Date('12-05-2013'),
  Excerpt: ""My first blog post."",
  Body: ""Hats keep your head warm.""  
}];

<p>The view template works fine.  However, the following edit template does not bind with the model and displays empty input forms:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/x-handlebars"" id=""post/_edit""&gt;

<p>Now instead of having columns like <code>hidden,featured</code> etc in the table <code>posts</code> to describe whether a post should be visible to all or should be displayed on a special <em>featured</em> page, I thought why not use tags to save time. So what I decided is that all posts that have a tag <code>#featured</code> will be featured and all posts with tag <code>#hidden</code> will be hidden.</p>

<p>Implementing first one was easy as I could use a join query and in my where clause I could mention <code>WHERE tag='featured'</code> and this would get all the featured posts for me. </p>

<p>But take an example of a post tagged <code>#sports</code> and <code>#hidden</code> if I were to use the query</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM posts
INNER JOIN posttags ON posttags.postid = posts.id
INNER JOIN tags ON posttags.tagid = tags.id
WHERE tag !='hidden'
</code></pre>

<p>but that'd still return the post tagged <code>hidden</code> since its also tagged <code>sports</code></p>

<p>This is an example of the code I have (called from the UI):</p>

public async void OtherAction()

<p>When I call <code>RunFromTheUI</code> it will return almost immediately (as per the Async and Await design).</p>

<p>But when it resumes after <code>services.SomeRemoteAction()</code> finishes it has a <code>foreach</code> loop and another method call to run through.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>If that loop is a performance hog will it freeze the UI?</strong>  (Before I had it all in a Background worker thread, so it did not slow the UI down).</p>

Each workflow has its own directory with property files which are used by the workflow engine.  Instead of a using separate user interfaces we want to have a common UI that can adopt to whichever flow is selected.  </p>

<p>Is there a javascript library that would be best to automate the collection of user input based on a json template? </p>

<p>For example if I know X flow requires 3 inputs I can simply define them in a json property file and our universal UI, using a magic javascript library, would simplify the creation of the UI.  Ideally if we had common inputs that were used across workflows they could be defined in a global configuration file and reused/referenced by some of the workflow specific property files. </p>

<p>I looked at the following but could use some direction:
-JsRender/JsViews
-Knockout.js
-Angular.js</p>

<p>I'm working with the datastore in the <code>DatastoreService</code> layer (I'm not using such persistence framework right now).</p>

<p>During my unit test I get the correct count of object sometimes and sometimes not. Which is expected. </p>

<p>This is my JUnit helper configuration:</p>

<p>Now, even if I have placed the put/get methods in a do-while loop with retries (with retry count of 4), it still misses to put/get entities. </p>

<p>So right now, for those specified frameworks, were they able to assure that if I put 3 object I will get 3 objects? If so how was it implemented? </p>

<p>The only thing I can think of is to use Memcache, that is, my methods will try to get the entity from it first, and if it misses that's the only time it will check the datastore. Is this a sound approach, or there is a better approach or right approach?</p>

<p>to remove the nodes in my XML document where the <code>product</code> string I'm searching for doesn't occur. Here is a sample of my XML structure:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;root&gt;
   &lt;string id = ""Hithere""&gt;
      &lt;product&gt;
         &lt;type&gt;orange&lt;/type&gt;

<p>So I need to look under the <code>product</code> element of each <code>string</code> element AND at each of the <code>type</code> elements therein to see if the value of string <code>product</code> (input to the method where this is contained) occurs. At present, it looks like my code only removes the node if the <code>product</code> string I'm searching for matches the value of just the first <code>type</code> element.</p>

<p>The whole point is to remove all string nodes from this xdoc that don't have the product I'm looking for listed under their <code>product</code> element.</p>

<p>I'm learning to work on lex/yacc using Ply (Python 3 / Win 8.1 system), but I've run into a snag: I can't seem to make yacc read the input file correctly.</p>

<p>If I hard-code the contents of the input file, I get the expected results, but if I try to read from it, yacc just reaches the end of file from State 0, stopping the syntactic analysis before it's really begun.</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == ""__main__"":

yacc.yacc()
inputfile = open(sys.argv[1], 'r', encoding=""UTF-8"")
lexer.input(inputfile.read())
for token in lexer: #for this part, the file is read correctly
    print(""line %d : %s (%s) "" % (token.lineno, token.type, token.value))

result = yacc.parse(inputfile.read(), debug=True)
print(result) #Stack immediately contains . $end and the p_error(p) I've defined confirms EOF was reached

I'd like to parallelize it across address spaces and physical machines.  Is it feasible to create a scheduler that would parallelize already multithreaded code across multiple physical computers under the following conditions:</p>

<ol>
<li>The code is already multithreaded and can scale pretty well on SMP configurations.</li>
<li>The fact that not all of the threads are running in the same address space or on the same physical machine must be transparent to the program, even if this comes at a significant performance penalty in some use cases.</li>
<li>You may assume that all of the physical machines involved are running operating systems and CPU architectures that are binary compatible.</li>
<li>Things like locks and atomic operations may be slow (having network latency to deal with and all) but must ""just work"".</li>
</ol>

<p>Edits: </p>

<ol>
<li>I only care about throughput, not latency.</li>
<li>I'm using the D programming language, and I'm almost sure there's no canned solution.  I'm more interested in whether this is feasible in principle than in a particular canned solution.</li>

<li>Comparison is done using an algorithm and result is written as a
new entity to db</li>
<li>At the end of one Mapreduce job, i programatically create another
job    </li>
<li>The previous record variable helps the job to compare with next
candidate record with rest of the data</li>
</ol>

<p>I am ready to increase any amount of GAE resources to achieve this in shortest time.</p>

<p>My Questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Will the accuracy of dedupe (checking for duplicates) affect due to
parallel jobs/tasks?</li>
<li>How can this design be improved?</li>
<li>Will this scale to 20 million records</li>
<li>Whats the fastest way to read/write variables (not just counters)
during map iteration which can be used across one mapreduce job.</li>
</ol>

<p>Freelancers most welcome to assist in this.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

Should I unescape it first? Is Angular capable of unescaping html with some available service?</p>

<p>The shop itself seems to be working fine, however when shop pages are called, they don't  seem to refresh properly. You need to F5 refresh on each shop page/category/taxonomy/single product etc, to get various page elements to fall in to line properly. For example, plus and minus add to cart form/ header page slider - and, sometimes the entire style sheet.</p>

<p>I'm about the 5th freelancer to work on this site, and I've only been working on the styling of the woocommerce shop - TBH I'm not exactly positive as to what the problem is here - I believe it to be a 'Current Theme Vs Woocommerce' issue and AJAX not updating the whole page when called.</p>

<p>Not being an 'expert' with PHP or AJAX, I'm looking for some ideas and ways forward to try to resolve these issues.</p>

<p>You can see the issues here:</p>

<pre><code>http://www.teamworksdesign.com/clients/playforce
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Just click on 'shop'</li>
</ul>

<p>Issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>shop header slider not working, unless page refreshed</p></li>
<li><p>on first load, style sheet sometimes does not load, unless page refreshed</p></li>
<li><p>On product page + and - for amount doesn't appear, unless page refreshed</p></li>
<li><p>remove from cart button on the view cart page results in an endless loop, until refreshed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I believe all these problems to be related to the way AJAX is working, I'm just not bright enough to put 2 and 2 together to find a starting point to rectify these issues.</p>

<p>Any help or insights you guys might have would be really helpful.</p>

I'm working on a project where I've checked out a working copy of the repository onto my hard drive.  I find that as I'm working with a particular file, I'll periodically break/fix things.  I'd like to get something working, commit that change so I know at least some functionality is working, so when I break something the next time I don't have to start from scratch again and wonder where the breakage occurred.  Does Tortoise SVN work by when I click on SVN Commit that it commits changes to the repository that everyone is using?  If so, is it typically a problem to have tons of commits?</p>

<p>I've previously managed doing the same by writing my own HttpWebRequest's. However, it then only works when I manually fetch the cookie from my browser and insert a fresh cookie-string to the request each time I'm doing a new ""session"". Now I'm trying to use BrowserSession to get smarter navigation.</p>

<p>Here's the current code:</p>

<pre><code>BrowserSession b = new BrowserSession();

b.Get(@""http://www.facebook.com/login.php"");
b.FormElements[""email""] = ""some@email.com"";
b.FormElements[""pass""] = ""xxxxxxxx"";
b.FormElements[""lsd""] = ""qDhIH"";

</code></pre>

<p>The above works fine. Trouble comes when I try to use this BrowserSession again to fetch another page. I'm doing it this way since BrowserSession saves the cookies from the last response and inserts them into the next request, thus I should not have to manually inser cookiedata fetched from my browser anymore.</p>

<p>However, when I try to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var profilePage = b.Get(@""https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1111111111"");

<h2>Multiprocessing Attempts</h2>

<p>I've been able to parallelize this (sort of) by adding the following:</p>

<pre><code>pool = mp.Pool(processes=mp.cpu_count())
m = mp.Manager()
q = m.Queue()

for index, row in table.iterrows():
    pool.apply_async([Toy(row) for _ in range(row['number'])])
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that this would be faster if the numbers in <code>row['number']</code> are substantially longer than the length of <code>table</code>. But in my actual case, <code>table</code> is thousands of lines long, and each <code>row['number']</code> is relatively small. </p>

<p>It seems smarter to try and break up <code>table</code> into <code>cpu_count()</code> chunks and iterate within the table. But now we're at the edge of my python skills.</p>

<p>I've tried things that the python interpreter screams at me for, like:</p>

<pre><code>pool.apply_async(
        for index, row in table.iterrows(): 
        [Toy(row) for _ in range(row['number'])]
        )
</code></pre>

<p>Also things that ""can't be pickled""</p>

<pre><code>Parallel(n_jobs=4)(
    delayed(Toy)([row for _ in range(row['number'])]) \
            for index, row in table.iterrows()
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Edit</h3>

<p>This may gotten me a little bit closer, but still not there. I create the class instances in a separate function, </p>

<pre><code>def create_toys(row):
    [Toy(row) for _ in range(row['number'])]

....

Parallel(n_jobs=4, backend=""threading"")(
    (create_toys)(row) for i, row in table.iterrows()
)
</code></pre>

<p>but I'm told 'NoneType' object is not iterable.</p>

<p>For example, the SWF contains these images:</p>

<pre><code>/assets/foo/bar/img1.jpg
/assets/foo/bar/img2.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>And it includes an AS file which is like this:</p>

public static const IMG_1:Class;

[Embed(source=""/assets/foo/bar/img2.jpg"")]
public static const IMG_2:Class;

<p>I would like to create a CSS declaration which uses these two images, but I don't want to embed the full path.  Is it possible to do something <em>like</em> this?</p>

        upIcon:   Assets.IMG_1;
        downIcon: Assets.IMG_2;
    }
&lt;/mx:Style&gt;

<p>At the moment, this particular syntax is invalid -- I'm getting compile errors for the ""."" character in the style declaration.</p>

<p>Is there another way of doing this <em>without</em> embedding the path (e.g. <code>upIcon: Embed(source=""/assets/foo/bar/img1.jpg"")</code>) in the CSS?</p>

<p>I use some caroufredsel slider on my website. After changing</p>

<p><strong>auto : sliderAuto ? sliderAuto : <em>false</em>;</strong></p>

<p>into</p>

<p><strong>auto : sliderAuto ? sliderAuto : <em>true</em>,</strong></p>

<p>every single slider is now on auto. Is there a way to say “this slider should start automatically and the other one not”? Like a rule or sth like that!?</p>

<p><strong>To extend the assignment we are supposed to use the same application but this time we are to create a MySQL database to store the information from the forms.</strong></p>

<p>This is something I do not have experience with... I am okay with HTML and some PHP, but do not know how to convert to MySQL or go about that? If someone can point me in the right direction!</p>

<p>Here is an image of my form... everything works besides ""Save to Database"" and ""View Contacts in Database"", as well as the save new contacts to file.

So if someone could give me some input!</p>

<p><strong>Next we are supposed to write an SQL script that you run &amp; generates and populates the appropriate tables for the application with at least 100 contacts. Please provide a brief explanation for each field of the table (or tables) in your DB...</strong></p>

<p>After this is all complete you go through the security measures it took for the web application. </p>

<p>I'm trying to make some kind of shared code ""repository"" so I don't have to copy the files to around 20 projects or something I'm having to maintain.</p>

<p>Environment: Win7, IIS 7, VS2010, ASP.NET 4.0 Website (not Web Application).</p>

<p>I've set my directory structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>App_Code
  - Shared.Web (virtual dir -&gt; C:\Apps\Shared\Shared.Web)
  - BasePage.cs &lt;- this one has problems :(
Bin
  - Shared.Bin (virtual dir -&gt; C:\Apps\Shared\Shared.Bin)
    - Shared.Web.dll
    - Shared.Web.pdb
MasterPage.aspx
MasterPage.cs
Default.aspx
Default.cs
Web.config
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works fine on the ASPX files, but the BasePage.cs has problems, because it has an </p>

<pre><code>using SharedWeb;
</code></pre>

<p>Which should work but it doesn't, stating that the assembly or namespace isn't found. I've set my web.config this way:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;

&lt;configuration&gt;

  &lt;system.web&gt;
    &lt;compilation debug=""false"" targetFramework=""4.0"" /&gt;
    &lt;pages maintainScrollPositionOnPostBack=""true"" /&gt;
  &lt;/system.web&gt;

  &lt;runtime&gt;
    &lt;assemblyBinding xmlns=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1""&gt;
      &lt;probing privatePath=""Bin;Bin\Shared.Bin;"" /&gt;
      &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;
        &lt;assemblyIdentity name=""SharedWeb"" /&gt;
        &lt;codeBase version=""1.0.0.0"" href=""FILE://C:/Apps/Shared/Shared.Bin/Shared.Web.dll"" /&gt;
      &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;
    &lt;/assemblyBinding&gt;
  &lt;/runtime&gt;

&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing fancy as you can see.</p>

<p>Now, the question: Any ideas on how to make the BasePage.cs file can get the assembly as an using directive for the assembly inside Bin/Shared.Bin?</p>

<p>Specific example:</p>

<pre>
#lang scheme

(require web-server/servlet)

(provide/contract (start (request? . -&gt; . response/c)))

(define (start request)
  (blog-dispatch request))

   ((""posts"" (string-arg)) review-post)
   ((""archive"" (integer-arg) (integer-arg)) review-archive)
   (else list-posts)))

(define (list-posts req) `(list-posts))
(define (review-post req p) `(review-post ,p))
(define (review-archive req y m) `(review-archive ,y ,m))

(require web-server/servlet-env)
(serve/servlet start
               #:launch-browser? #t
               #:quit? #f
               #:listen-ip #f

               #:servlet-path """")</pre>

<p>Assuming the above code, <code>localhost:8080/</code> goes to a page that says ""list-posts"". Going to <code>localhost:8080/posts/test</code> goes to a Racket ""file not found"" page (I'd expect it to go to a page that says ""review-post test"").</p>

<pre><code>function clean_str($str){
    return preg_replace('#[^a-z_ 0-9@.-]#i', '', $str);
}

if ($_POST){
    foreach ($_POST AS $key =&gt; $val){
        $_POST[$key] = clean_str($val);
    }
}

if ($_GET){
    foreach ($_GET AS $key =&gt; $val){
        $_GET[$key] = clean_str($val);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet would simply be run at the beginning of each http request. The clean_str function can be developed to allow other chars and replace characters etc (this is just an example). But I think the first goal are to simply prevent sql injection. The only bad thing I can see with this approach right now is if your ""plugin"" need to send sql commands from user input. The appraoch above could we wrapped in a function of course and be called if needed. Post and Get are global vars so that would not be a problem.</p>

<p>I'm actually writing my own framework (still a lot of work) that I will release if I ever be able to finish it. The thing is that I often see novice developers add $_POST['userinput'] inside DB queries. The code above should make even that okay. Well that was some background of what I'm up to and why I bring this up.</p>

<p>I would be very happy to hear your thoughts. This might not be the best question for stack overflow, I suppose I want to open more like a discussion to this approach to share thoughts and inputs. But to formulate my question(s) to this, it would be something in line with: Are there any other approaches that would be faster or more scalable than this, or is equal to this, or can another function complement this approach? Is this approach good practice? Is it okay to overwrite the global vars of post and get data like above?</p>

<p>I know the code above is not objectoriented, but it's about the approach of cleaning the users inputdatas automatically before running checks on them. I think this will save a lot of code and headaches.</p>

<p>Please share your thoughts with me and everyone who comes across this thread. As comments are limited here on stack overflow, I would appreciate if you reply as answers if you bring new thoughts to this table. Comments are to comment on specific thoughts/answers in this case. Please also upvote my question if you find this interesting and would like to hear more inputs on this.</p>

<p>I've also noticed that within my worker thread, thread_func, that StartService returns even though the service continues to run.  I figured that the call to StartService would block until myService exits.</p>

<p>Why is the thread id in myService.OnStartCommand not the same as thread_func's, isn't thread_func its parent being that is where the call to StartService is made ?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>1) Calculate some coordinates clicking button 1</p>

<p>2) Click button 2 to draw a line with the numbers from button 1</p>

<p>3) Click button 1 to get new coordinates</p>

<p>4) click button 2 to draw the previous line AND the new line. </p>

<p>5) click button 3 to clear the graph. </p>

<p>So I decided to draw everthing on top of a Panel, called panel1. I have a routine that draws on screen called drawlines,</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub drawlines(ByVal g As Graphics, ByVal c As Color)
  Dim p As New Pen(c, 1)
  g.DrawLine(p, xStart, yStart, xEnd, yEnd)
  p.Dispose()
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>and the other routines:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
  'AddHandler Panel1.Paint, AddressOf DrawLine
  GraphicsHandler = Panel1.CreateGraphics
End Sub

Private Sub drawlines(ByVal g As Graphics, ByVal c As Color)
  Dim p As New Pen(c, 1)
  g.DrawLine(p, xStart, yStart, xEnd, yEnd)
  p.Dispose()
End Sub

Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
  'GraphicsHandler = Panel1.CreateGraphics
  GraphicsHandler.DrawLine(myPen, 10, 10, 200, 100)
End Sub

Private Sub Button2_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click
  xStart = CInt(Math.Ceiling(Rnd() * 200))
  yStart = CInt(Math.Ceiling(Rnd() * 100))
  xEnd = CInt(Math.Ceiling(Rnd() * 200))
  yEnd = CInt(Math.Ceiling(Rnd() * 100))
  Me.Panel1.Invalidate()
End Sub

Private Sub Panel1_Paint(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As PaintEventArgs) Handles Panel1.Paint
  drawlines(e.Graphics, Color.Blue)
End Sub

Private Sub Button3_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles Button3.Click
  GraphicsHandler.Clear(Color.White)
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>So far, only using the GraphicsHandler thing is working, but everytime I try to minimize the window or draw a new line, the previous lines are erased. Can some kind soul explain to me proper way to do the simple 1-5 above? For example, how can I call drawlines()from the button?</p>

<p>Following are the view and projection matrices:</p>

<pre><code>var w2 = ScreenWidthInPixels/2;

<pre><code>var m = Vector3.Unproject(p, 0, 0, ScreenWidthInPixels, ScreenHeightInPixels,

<li>What parameters do I have to pass for <code>x,y,width,height</code> in <code>Unproject(...)</code>?</li>
<li>What significance has the <code>minZ</code> and <code>maxZ</code> parameter in <code>Unproject(...)</code>?</li>

"5506914","1","5735166","","2011-03-31 22:07:24","","2","81","<p>I'm using Django and have a MySQL database filled with arbitrary RGB colors. The RGB values are stored as Integers.</p>

<pre><code>| Name  | R | G | B |
+-------+---+---+---+
| Green | 0 |255| 0 |
| Cyan  | 0 |255|255|
| ...   | . | . | . |
| Foo   |123| 45| 2 |
| ...   | . | . | . |
</code></pre>

<p>Given an arbitrary RGB value <code>(a,b,c)</code> I want to calculate what colors in the database are ""close to"" <code>(a,b,c)</code>. I'll predefine what ""close to"" means in my query but for now let's call it <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>You can think of the RGB color space as a three dimensional space with colors as points in that space. So <code>(a,b,c)</code> and <code>x</code> define a sphere in that space with a center point <code>(a,b,c)</code> and radius <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>Pythagorus tells us that the following is true for all of the points within this sphere:</p>

<pre><code>(R-a)**2 + (G-b)**2 + (B-c)**2 &lt;= x**2
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to translate this into a valid Django Query. And, failing that, a MySQL query.</p>

<p>I'm no MySQL expert but I have some suspicions that the Django Query syntax may be very limiting in this context. Would writing a raw SQL query be the way to go here? Would it be better because the code would be more clear? Could it actually be faster/more efficient?</p>

<p>Django Color Model looks like:</p>

<pre><code>class Color(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=32)
    r = models.IntegerField()
    g = models.IntegerField()
    b = models.IntegerField()
</code></pre>

<p>An example query:</p>

<pre><code>c = (234, 23, 45)
x = 25

nearby_colors = Color.objects.filter(....) # Awesome-sauce

<p><strong>Here's problem #2:</strong> You cannot select different 'Quantities' for items in your cart because the  tag is in the <code>while loop</code> i.e. </p>

<p><strong>Potential solution I thought:</strong> Create three different  tags outside of the <code>while loop</code> allowing you to select a 'Quantity' for each item in the cart, separately. </p>

<p><strong>Problem with my solution</strong>: It's not robust and functional because if I want to add more then 3 products in my cart I'll have to code <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> tag myself for every new item in cart(!).</p>

<p><strong>What is the most optimal way to show the items in a cart retrieved from the database i.e. <code>prod_desc</code> and also users to pick a quantity for each item separately?</strong> </p>

FD_ZERO(&amp;rfds);
FD_SET(sockDesc, &amp;rfds);

throw SocketException(""error"", true);
}
return rtn;
</code></pre>

<p>So.<br />
Depending the type of data i return i need to implement timeout or not.<br />
If i just send text data i dont need, if i send one file i need...<br />
To explain more or less i'm sending some data trough socket and processing on the other side.<br />
So, if i send one tar<br /></p>

<pre><code>while(readtar){

  senddata
  get processed data
}
</code></pre>

<p>but sometimes the data sent is just the header, so when the other side process data it doesn't needs to return data and the socket stops on read.<br />
To ilustrate<br />
cat file.tar | myprogram -c ""tar -zvt""<br />
So it dont returns nothing until receive enough data to return the name of file.<br /></p>

<p>If i just send one file and returns the ""cat"" i dont have this problem <br />
echo ""asjdoiajdlaijdkasdjlkas"" | myprogram -c ""cat""<br />
or<br />
cat HUGEFILE.tar | myprogram -c ""cat"" | tar -zvt<br />
In this case it does the same thing, but is not on the server side... so it dont work for me.<br /></p>

<p>Now.... If i just use the recv without the select when i return the data using the cat it works... no problems with that.<br />
BUT if i implement the select the data comes messed up<br /></p>

<p>WITHOUT SELECT</p>

<p>send ""command line text temp test""<br />
recv ""command line text temp test""</p>

<p>WITH</p>

<p>send ""command line text temp test""<br />
recv ""commmand lin/ˆ<br />
1k5d99ck""</p>

<p>its just to ilustrate what is hapenning</p>

<p>Client loop:</p>

<pre><code>while(size = read(fileno(stdin), thebuffer, 10000)){
  sock-&gt;send(thebuffer, size); // if this data is not enough the other side never sends the data back
  sock-&gt;recv //receive data
}
</code></pre>

<p>On the other side i do</p>

<pre><code>if(pid == 0){
//stuffs closes, dup2
execlp(""bash"", ""bash"", ""-c"", ""run.c_str(), NULL); // if i use one tar -zvt i need a bunch of data to generate the return
  }
else
while(size = read(fout[0], buffer, 10000) &gt; 0)){
  sock-&gt;send(buffer, size);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So.. if the data sent is not enough to generate on 
If i could check if read have anything or on the stdin side if the execlp send a terminator i could solve the problem</p>

<p>I looked at the location it was accessing and there is no build file inside the google-play-services_lib folder.

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I modified the set up so that I now reference a copy of the project in the location of my project, however the issue remains the same that ant is looking for a build file for the google play services project that does not exist.</p>

<p>The problem which I am facing is that whenever the video is played, it only plays with sound when the earphones are connected and sometimes the audio can also be heard from the top-speaker (the speaker used during calls).</p>

<p>I have checked for the ringer and volume controls. Everything is at maximum.
My app supports iOS versions 5.0 and above.
Could this be iOS related issue?</p>

<p>Kindly provide some direction.</p>

<p>Thanx</p>

<p>I have a website that I want to deploy to my web server, so I'm using IIS 7 and followed these steps to authenticate logging into it:</p>

<p>1- Open IIS</p>

<p>2- Add Website (with random port number)</p>

<p>3- Set the application pool for it to a specific Identity </p>

<p>4- Disable Anonymous authentication then enable Windows Authentication.</p>

<p>5- Remove ""Allow All users"" rule </p>

<p>6- Add allow rule for an admin user and give him full control access </p>

<p>When I try to access it it asks for a username and password which must be the same user as the one added in step 6 .</p>

<p>The problem is whenever I click ok the logging window keeps popping up and can't access the website as a result </p>

<p>I also tried to add deny rule for anonymous users </p>

<p>Is there anything must be added to web.config file or something ? Do I need to install something or disable something ?</p>

<p>Any suggestion is very appreciated </p>

This is my web.config file authorization section </p>

<p>I'm learning basic Swing and doing <a href=""http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c6/ex3-ans.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this exercise</a> from the online book Introduction to Programming with Java.</p>

<p>I haven't followed the instructions to the letter and instead am trying to do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a window that shows a visual representation of two dice</li>
<li>when you click on one of the dice, it 'rolls' and shows the new value</li>
</ul>

<p>My implementation:</p>

<ul>
<li>a very basic JDie object that extends JPanel</li>
<li>overridden paintComponent method to draw the die representation</li>
<li>change die color every time value is changed just for a visual clue </li>
<li>added a listener to 'roll' the dice when mouse is pressed and then<br>
repaint</li>
</ul>

<p>The bug is quite specific:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run the DieTest main method</li>
<li>Resize the window to fit the two die</li>
<li>Click on the second die to roll it</li>
<li>Now click on the first die to roll it</li>
<li>The second die's value <strong>changes back to its original value</strong></li>
<li>If you resize the window the second die's value will also change back</li>
</ol>

<p>If I click on the dice to roll them, <strong>before</strong> I resize the window, the bug won't appear...</p>

<p>I guess I'm making a basic mistake somewhere which has just disguised itself as this strange behaviour.</p>

<p>--------------EDIT-----------------</p>

<p>Running the code again, I've now noticed it doesn't happen 100% of the time, but the bug is still there. Here's a gif that I just took of it bugging that might illustrate the problem better:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LkoB3.gif"" alt=""Strange bug""></p>

<p>You can clearly see the original value with the original color is being redrawn when I click the first die again.
When I resize the window, the second die's value jumps back one, to the previous value it had...
I really don't understand this...</p>

<p>---------------EDIT 2---------------------</p>

<ul>
<li>Tried the same code on another computer (mac) but couldn't replicate
the problem.</li>
<li>Compiled and ran the code on my computer outside of Eclipse, couldn't
replicate the problem.</li>
<li>Ran the code that Eclipse had compiled from command line, only got
the problem once, couldn't replicate it today.</li>
<li>Running the code from Eclipse, I still get the problem about 1 in
5-10 times? If it doesn't show up on the first 'pass' as it were, it
doesn't show up at all. The gif illustrates it well.</li>
</ul>

<p>So it seems my computer set up has some bearing on this as well, details are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 7 64 bit</li>
<li>Eclipse Kepler Service Release 1</li>
<li>Java Version 7 Update 51</li>
<li>Java SE Development Kit 7 Update 3 (64 bit)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a tricky one as I know longer know whether it's my code or some other program's that is causing the problem. As a newb how can I know whether any future problems are a result of my bad programming or something else... frustrating.</p>

<p>----------EDIT 3-----------</p>

<p>As a quick investigation into the concurrency side of things:
I set all the instance fields to volatile
I set all the methods including paintComponent to synchronized
I removed the Math.random() call (although I read another thread saying that this was the thread safe implementation) and replaced it with instance Random objects instead</p>

<p>Unfortunately I still get the visual switchback.</p>

<p>Another thing I've noticed is that it seems to be happening a lot less often now about 1 in 10 times. I keep on getting my hopes up that it's fixed, and then the next attempt bugs again. In my original program I was working on, it seemed more like 1 in 3 (I've completely changed that program now so don't have it to hand).</p>

<p>--------EDIT 4---------
I have come up with a slightly more stripped down version which no longer uses any random values and still produces the visual switchback. It seems to happen more often with this code:</p>

<pre><code>import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

        //color starts off black
        //once it is changed should never be 
        //black again
        private Color color = Color.BLACK;

        ColorPanel(){
            //add listener
                    //click on panel to rotate color
            addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter(){
                @Override
                public void mousePressed(MouseEvent arg0) {
                    color = rotateColor();
                    repaint();
                }
            });
        }
        //rotates the color black/blue &gt; red &gt; green &gt; blue
        private Color rotateColor(){
            if (color==Color.BLACK || color == Color.BLUE)
                return Color.RED;
            if (color==Color.RED)
                return Color.GREEN;
            else return Color.BLUE;
        }

        @Override
        public void paintComponent(Graphics g){
            g.setColor(color);
            g.fillRect(0, 0, 100, 100);
        }
    }
ColorPanelsWindow(){
    setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

    setLayout(new GridLayout(1,0));
    add(new ColorPanel());
    add(new ColorPanel());
    //the size must be set so that the window is too small
    // and the two ColorPanels are overlapping
    setSize(40, 40);

        }

    });
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>A couple of observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>afaict the panels must be overlapping at first</li>
<li>if I use a flow layout, increase the size of the window, or any way
that stops the panels from overlapping initially, then I don't seem
to get the problem (or maybe it just happens much less often?)</li>
</ul>

However, one site that I look after is getting bombarded by registration spam lately. It is an extremely low traffic site and was a bit neglected which meant it was running an old version of EE.</p>

<p>I've now updated the site to the latest EE version and gone through double checking that everything was locked down. I've even tried installing Low NoSpam but I'm still getting the attempted registrations.</p>

<p>When the user submits a form, I wish to output some data to the Firebug console and FirePHP is perfect for the job.</p>

<p>This all seems to work fine, except that when my server code processes the form, it then redirects to another page - using Zend's _redirect() - causing Firebug to clear the console.  So I never get to see the logged output.</p>

<p>If I prevent the redirect, then I see the output (but that's not a typical workflow for form submission - I submit to the same action, validate and process and then redirect where I want the user to end up.)  This is an established web app.</p>

<p>Is there any workaround for this?  I might have to resort to logging to a database or file, but the Firebug console is the ideal place for what I'm logging.</p>

    init(names:[String], keys:[String]) {

<pre><code>""fatal error: use of unimplemented initializer 'init()' for class...""

<p>So I can can avoid this error, by adding the arrays optionals (not what I want as they are the tableView's dataSource) and adding an override init() call:</p>

<pre><code>class TableController: NSObject, NSTableViewDataSource, NSTableViewDelegate {

var paintingNames:[String]?
var paintingKeys:[String]?

override init() { // this gets called after the first custom init function

    // a breakpoint here shows the arrays are now both nil

init(names:[String], keys:[String]) { //this gets called first
    paintingNames = names
    paintingKeys = keys
    //      breakpoint here shows both arrays have values
}
...
}

<p>Without the nil check on the arrays in the override init() call, the arrays are nil. Even with this bit of logic added:</p>

<pre><code>override init() { // this gets called after the first custom init function
    if paintingNames != nil {
        paintingNames = [String]()

    if paintingKeys != nil {

<p>My app once purchased runs on tablets devices WITHOUT internet connection. GP allows users to install this on as many devices as they like using the same account details.</p>

<p>Increasingly my app is being used for commercial corporate use and I want a way to insure I get paid when the app is installed by commercial companies more than once. For example a Bar or Hospital has many tablets running my app, but they only paid once.</p>

<p>As far as I can see there is no specific billing to fit my purpose.</p>

<p>One thought was to display some kind of commercial user agreement at startup that stated that for non personal use they would have to purchase licenses directly to allow them to use it legitimately for each additional device they install it on.</p>

<p>This would rely on honesty, so can be ignored.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<p>Is there a billing method I've overlooked that could handle this situation?
Is there an alternative way to handle this?
Would I be in breach of GP if I had an commercial user agreement that sort of contradicts the GP billing model. eg paid apps can be installed on multiple devices owned by the same user account? And request additional payment for each device its installed on not using billing.</p>

<p>Currently I have code using <strong>Win32_PnPEntity</strong> which can extract a list of pnp devices with either modem or COM in the name but unfortunatley when I return the COM devices they do not carry the modem name and when I extract modem device they do not associate with a COM port (so if I have two modems attached I do not know which is in COM port 3). I have also found a <strong>Win32_SerialPort</strong> function but this does not return all devices attatched to my computer via serial ports.</p>

<p>When I attempt this method for some URLs that have legitimate (intended by the URL site) redirects, I receive an error when trying to obtain the Request object.</p>

<p>For example, when this URL is entered into a browser:

...the browser will ultimately arrive at this address:
<a href=""http://www.te.com/en/home.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.te.com/en/home.html</a></p>

<p>However this VBA code will return  Error -2147012744: ""The server returned an invalid or unrecognized response"". The error is thrown on the .Send statement.</p>

<p>How is my browser able to get to the destination: <a href=""http://www.te.com/en/home.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.te.com/en/home.html</a>, if an HTTP request with that URL returns an error?</p>

<p>I can use the browser's application to get the final destination URL like this:</p>

<pre><code>Function sGetFinalURL(sURL As String) As String
 Dim oAppIE As Object
 Dim sReturn As String

 Set oAppIE = CreateObject(""InternetExplorer.Application"")

 With oAppIE
   .Navigate sURL

   Do While .Busy
   Loop
   sReturn = .document.url
   .Quit
 End With
 Set oAppIE = Nothing

 sGetFinalURL = sReturn
End Function

Because in the namespace Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AdomdClient we have a <strong>sealed</strong> class:  </p>

<p>a) Why is it restricted to use a sealed class as a generic parameter (!<em>parameter</em>, not <em>constraint</em>!)?<br>
b) How to workaround this?<br>
c*) Was it a good idea to make that class sealed?</p>

<p>PS. Maybe you have a lot of reasons to consider that this generic DbManager is not a good idea, but, anyway, I would like just to understand if it is possible to workaround this sealed class in generic param... Thanks!</p>

<p>PPS. Error message: </p>

However, the class I'm using comes from an <a href=""https://github.com/koraktor/steam-condenser-php/blob/master/lib/SteamCondenser/Community/SteamId.php"" rel=""nofollow"">external package</a>. The class <code>SteamId</code> requires an argument to be passed.</p>

<pre><code>$steam = new \SteamCondenser\Community\SteamId('1234');
</code></pre>

<p>So, although this works, it is not testable or mockable. I get the id required from the URL once the user has ""logged in"", so I cannot bind the class to an instance of SteamId on boot, since I don't know the ID then. E.g</p>

<pre><code>App::bind('SteamCondenser\Community\SteamId', function() {
    return new SteamCondenser\Community\SteamId('1234');
});

class SteamController extends BaseController {

    public function __construct(\SteamCondenser\Community\SteamId $steam) {

    }

<p>I don't the ID until a method on my <code>SteamController</code> has been called.</p>

<p>I suppose that <code>QuerySyntaxException: QueueConfiguration is not mapped</code> means that my</p>

<pre><code>@javax.persistence.Entity
@javax.persistence.Table(name = ""queue_configuration"")
public class QueueConfiguration { /* ... */ }
</code></pre>

<p>class is not recognized as an entity by Hibernate. Indeed, when I run the application in JBoss 4, the startup logs contain rows like</p>

<pre><code>INFO  [org.hibernate.cfg.AnnotationBinder] Binding entity from annotated class: se.sunstone.workflow.queues.QueueConfiguration
</code></pre>

<p>but no such rows appear in the log when I try to deploy it in JBoss 7. If I comment out the <code>engine</code> bean from <code>jboss-spring.xml</code>, the application happily deploys without exceptions.</p>

<p>I'm using JBoss 7's built-in Hibernate module and I'm deploying my webapp using the Snowdrop module. I have monkeyed around with this for a few days now, including trying to use Hibernate 3 instead, but the problem persists.</p>

<p>If I explicitly specify <code>&lt;class&gt;se.sunstone.workflow.queues.QueueConfiguration&lt;/class&gt;</code> in <code>persistence.xml</code>, the application deploys and the logs now contain the same AnnotationBinder rows as when running on JBoss 4. However, the application also has a bunch of other annotated entities, whose DAOs are omitted from the configs below, and they are not detected unless I specify them too in <code>persistence.xml</code>. Apparently the AnnotationBinder does not detect my annotated entities unless I specify them in <code>persistence.xml</code>. Why is that?</p>

I want to find the 1st and 2nd largest eigenvalues of a big, sparse and symmetric matrix (in python). scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh with k=2 gives the second largest eigenvalue with respect to the absolute value - so it's not a good solution. In addition, I can't use numpy methods because my matrix is too big and numpy is too slow... <br>

<p><strong>EDIT [2]:</strong>
brpara is my counter so I know which is number of row which is being added. I have a max of 20 rows.
Also, my loop is working perfectly for deleting one row, but when I delete multiple rows at once, it only changes my row numbers for the first time and after that only deletes rows.</p>

        &lt;OverlayElement 2/&gt;

        &lt;.../&gt;
    &lt;/Canvas&gt;        
&lt;/Canvas&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Image's Source is a WriteableBitmap. Every time a new camera image (type byte[]) is available, the main Canvas' Dispatcher is invoked to write the image data by using WriteableBitmap.WritePixels().</p>

<p>The inner Canvas contains all Overlay Elements, being 
- a contour (PolyLine)
- a circle (Path with EllipseGeometry) and
- a set of Rays (Path with one Figure containing LineSgements).
The number n of Points in the contour equals the number of line Segments in the last mentioned Path. n is usually around 1,000 - 3,000.</p>

<p>Depending on the count and length of Lines shown in the overlay the CPU load for showing a live image varies (increases if length or count go up) even if the overlay does not change. At some point this affects the frame rate and makes the program unusable. Line length is mostly correlated with line intersection, so maybe the Path is struggling to calculate it's fill area despite it is not painted?</p>

<p>So how could I improve the performance here? 
What bugs me most is that even if the overlay does not change, the render time increases with it's primitive count. I would expect to have constant render time once the overlay has been drawn in it's last set state. What could I do to achieve that aside from rendering the whole overlay to a bitmap?</p>

<p>I am also open minded for suggestions on how to get the byte[] onto the screen more efficiently. Just keep in mind this problem is part of a bigger Application and i cannot change all paradigms concentrating on how to get the image drawn.</p>

<p>What I have tried so far:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Override the OnRender() method of the inner Canvas, drawing the overlay myself. This works fine but has the performance issue that brings me here ;)</p></li>
<li><p>Use Shapes (PolyLine, Ellipse, Path) as the inner Canvas' children to hold the overlay elements. This works, too. It is faster to redraw the overlay when it changes but on the other hand worsens the performance issue when updating the background image.</p></li>
<li><p>Like 2., but use Freeze() on Geometries wherever possible. Has no or little performance impact.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for your help in advance.</p>

<p>Before I added <code>packagesToScan</code>, I had a minimal <code>persistence.xml</code>, and set the <code>persistenceXmlLocation</code>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;property name=""persistenceXmlLocation""
    value=""classpath:META-INF/persistence.xml""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which worked fine. So what am I doing incorrectly now?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> added <code>jpaVendorAdapter</code>, error remains.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> removed persistenceUnitName per a deleted comment; renamed beans to the persistence unit name (for <code>@PersistenceContext</code>)</p>

<p><strong>update</strong> this error seems to depend upon which kind of application context loader is used. The code works in a spring/junit test via <code>@ContextConfiguration</code>, but not via <code>ClassPathXmlApplicationContext</code></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> </p>

<p><em>Case 0</em>-> Close the window where I am now and after this there is no chance of executing other cases. As Second Window is the Window containing 4 Quadrants.</p>

<p><em>Case(1-4)</em>-> All are executable but can be executed one at a time.</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableArray* s = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
stack = s;
[s release];
</code></pre>

<p>should have been</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableArray* s = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
stack = s;
</code></pre>

<p>However, stack is a retained property of my class. It's declared like so:</p>

<pre><code>@interface StateStack ()
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableArray* stack;
@end
</code></pre>

<p>I was under the impression that when you assign a 'retain' variable, it automatically increments the retainCount of the object. So you are supposed to start by releasing your pointer (as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/156243/object-allocate-and-init-in-objective-c"">here</a>).</p>

<p>Why are these two cases different? Thanks!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, the 'files' variable contains a JSON array of file paths. for each index in the array, the Search_file function is run on that path, which should display a list of search results for that file - calling &amp; displaying the search_file.php page. </p>

<p>When the user clicks on any of those results in the displayed list, it should attempt to insert (via the InsertIntoDB Function, which calls the update_movie.php file) a record into the database. </p>

<p>If that insert is successful (update_movie returns 0) (or the EnterManually function is triggered) then the functions should all exit, and the .each loop should move onto the next iteration, starting the whole process off again.</p>

<p>If that insert function is not successfull (so update_movie will return 1), then nothing should happen - the each loop should not increment. Instead, we should wait for the user to click on another result.</p>

<p>At the moment, I cannot get the .each loop to wait until  the user has clicked on a result, it just keeps incrementing straight until the last item in the loop.</p>

The form has some simple drop down options to filter the content on the page, so the page just reads these form filter vars to change the data shown-- very simple.</p>

<p>The problem is that when caching (<code>memcached</code>) is enabled, the whole page is cached-- so any time you submit the filter, it just reloads the last time the page was viewed and you get the same values for everything (including the filter you just changed).</p>

<p>I've tried using javascript to inject the form <code>action</code> and append <code>Date.now()</code> to the URL string, but this seems to get cached along with everything else. I've set <code>no-cache</code> page headers, expired the page at a date in the past, etc. but nothing seems to work.</p>

<p>It's confusing me since when I have my Chrome dev tools open (with the ""don't cache when this is open"" option set) the page doesn't get cached-- which suggests that it's being cached in the browser? Except it's not.</p>

<p>How can I attach an event of an element to a method of a class? More specifically, the same class? Is there a better way?</p>

<p>Using a Qt widget style approach, I've been trying to create self-contained ""widget"" objects in javascript. I'm using the Prototype javascript framework and building my widget as a class. Then, using Event.observe, I've tried to attach the event to a method of the class. But the Event assignment unbinds the assigned method. Here's an example of a simple table I'm trying to build that has clickable column headers:</p>

<pre><code> Objectify.Grid.Table = Class.create({
    initialize: function(headers) {
        this.columns = headers;
        this.rows = [];
    }, 
    addRow: function(GridData) {
        var len = this.rows.push(GridData);
        return len-1;
    },
    getRow: function(rowIndex) {
        return this.rows[rowIndex];
    },
    build: function(parent) {
        this.mainTable = new Element('table',{'class':'Objectify-Grid'});
        $(parent).update(this.mainTable);

        var tableBody = new Element('tbody',{});
        this.mainTable.update(tableBody);

            var headerRow = new Element('tr',{'class':'Objectify-Grid-header-row'});
            tableBody.update(headerRow);

                this.columns.each(function(val,id) {
                    var hcell = new Element('td',{'class':'Objectify-Grid-header-cell'}).update(val);
                    headerRow.insert(hcell);
                    // EVENT ASSIGNMENT //

				    this.columns.each(function(columnName,index) {

<p>This is the <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=harmonic%20mean"">WolframAlpha definition</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/TOX7u.gif"" alt=""Harmonic Mean Definition from WolframAlpha""></p>

<hr>

<p>And this is the equivalent implementation in PHP:</p>

<pre><code>function harmonicMeanV1()
{
    $result = 0;
    $arguments = func_get_args();

    foreach ($arguments as $argument)
    {
        $result += 1 / $argument;
    }

    return func_num_args() / $result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if any of the arguments is <code>0</code> this will throw a division by 0 warning, but since <code>1 / n</code> is the same as <strong><em>n</em><sup>-1</sup></strong> and <code>pow(0, -1)</code> gracefully returns the <code>INF</code> constant without throwing any errors I could rewrite that to the following (it'll still throw errors if there are no arguments, but lets ignore that for now):</p>

<pre><code>function harmonicMeanV2()
{
    $arguments = func_get_args();
    $arguments = array_map('pow', $arguments, array_fill(0, count($arguments), -1));

    return count($arguments) / array_sum($arguments);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Both implementations work fine for most cases (example <a href=""http://codepad.org/pi38gWAL"">v1</a>, <a href=""http://codepad.org/0kza3RDS"">v2</a> and <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=harmonic%20mean%20%7B40,%2060%7D"">WolframAlpha</a>), but they fail spectacularly <em>if the sum of the</em> <strong>1 / n<sub><em>i</em></sub></strong> <em>series is 0</em>, I should get another division by 0 warning, but I don't...</p>

<p>Consider the following set: <code>-2, 3, 6</code> (<a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=harmonic%20mean%20%7B-2,%203,%206%7D"">WolframAlpha</a> says it's a complex infinite):</p>

<pre><code>  1 / -2    // -0.5
+ 1 / 3     // 0.33333333333333333333333333333333
+ 1 / 6     // 0.16666666666666666666666666666667

= 0
</code></pre>

<p>However, both my implementations return <strong><code>-2.7755575615629E-17</code> as the sum</strong> (<a href=""http://codepad.org/RkcCklUo"">v1</a>, <a href=""http://codepad.org/ZLdEwU1C"">v2</a>) instead of <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>While the return result on CodePad is <code>-108086391056890000</code> my dev machine (32-bit) says it's <code>-1.0808639105689E+17</code>, still it's nothing like the <code>0</code> or <code>INF</code> I was expecting. I even tried calling <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.is-infinite.php""><code>is_infinite()</code></a> on the return value, but it came back as <code>false</code> as expected.</p>

<p>I also found the <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.stats-harmonic-mean.php""><code>stats_harmonic_mean()</code></a> function that's part of the <code>stats</code> PECL extension, but to my suprise I got the exact same buggy result: <code>-1.0808639105689E+17</code>, if any of the arguments is <code>0</code>, <code>0</code> is returned but no checks are done to the <strong>sum</strong> of the series, <a href=""http://svn.php.net/viewvc/pecl/stats/trunk/php_stats.c?revision=313529&amp;view=markup"">as you can see on <strong>line 3585</strong></a>:</p>

"28123375","1","28252102","","2015-01-24 07:37:18","","6","96","<p>It's my understanding of atomicity that it's used to make sure a value will be read/written in whole rather than in parts. For example, a 64-bit value that is really two 32-bit DWORDs (assume x86 here) must be atomic when shared between threads so that both DWORDs are read/written at the same time. That way one thread can't read half variable that's not updated. How do you guarantee atomicity?</p>

<p>Furthermore it's my understanding that volatility does not guarantee thread safety at all. Is that true?</p>

<p>I've seen it implied many places that simply being atomic/volatile is thread-safe. I don't see how that is. Won't I need a memory barrier as well to ensure that any values, atomic or otherwise, are read/written before they can actually be guaranteed to be read/written in the other thread?</p>

<p>So for example let's say I create a thread suspended, do some calculations to change some values to a struct available to the thread and then resume, for example:</p>

<pre><code>HANDLE hThread = CreateThread(NULL, 0, thread_entry, (void *)&amp;data, CREATE_SUSPENDED, NULL);
data-&gt;val64 = SomeCalculation();
ResumeThread(hThread);
</code></pre>

<p>I suppose this would depend on any memory barriers in ResumeThread? Should I do an interlocked exchange for val64? What if the thread were running, how does that change things?</p>

<p>I'm sure I'm asking a lot here but basically what I'm trying to figure out is what I asked in the title: a good explanation for atomicity, volatility and thread safety in Windows. Thanks</p>

<p>As you can see here I am wrapping the ""os"" object for encryption, compression etc., and then re-assigning ""os"" variable with a different object (created using new) inside each of wrapOStreamWithCheckSum, wrapOStreamWithCipher and wrapOStreamWithCompress methods. I was wondering if this leads to memory leaks by any chance? What would actually happen to the older ""os"" objects created? To rephrase, there are 4 objects created using ""new"", but being re-assigned to the same ""os"" variable. I am finding it hard to understand because the new object creation/functioning itself is dependent on the old object internally.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>

Those two stacks are constant in size, persisted and updated lazily, and are often accessed together by some computationally cheap methods that, however, can be called a large number of times (tens to hundred of thousands of times per second).</p>

<p>All objects are already in good state (code is clean and does what it's supposed to do), all sizes kept under control (64k to 128K most cases for the whole chain of ops including results, rarely they get close to 256k, so at worse an L2 look-up and often L1).</p>

<p>some auto-vectorization comes into play, but other than that it's single threaded code throughout.</p>

    std::vector&lt;ControlPoint&gt; m_controls;

<p>Bear with the verbosity, please, I'm trying to educate myself and make sure I'm not operating by some half-arsed knowledge:</p>

<p>Given the operations that are run on those and their actual use, performance is largely memory I/O bound.
I have a few questions related to optimal positioning of the data, keep in mind this is on Intel CPUs (Ivy and a few Haswell) and with GCC 4.4, I have no other use cases for this:</p>

<p>I'm assuming that if the actual storage of controls and segments are contiguous to the instance of Curve that's an ideal scenario for the cache (size wise the lot can easily fit on my target CPUs).
A related assumption is that if the vectors are distant from the instance of the Curve , and between themselves, as methods alternatively access the contents of those two members, there will be more frequent eviction and re-populating the L1 cache.</p>

<p>1) Is that correct (data is pulled for the entire stretch of cache size from the address first looked up on a new operation, and not in convenient multiple segments of appropriate size), or am I mis-understanding the caching mechanism and the cache can pull and preserve multiple smaller stretches of ram?</p>

<p>2) Following the above, insofar by pure circumstance all my test always end up with the class' instance and the vectors contiguous, but I assume that's just dumb luck, however statistically probable. Normally instancing the class reserves only the space for that object, and then the vectors are allocated in the next free contiguous chunk available, which is not guaranteed to be anywhere near my Curve instance if that previously found a small emptier niche in memory.
Is this correct?</p>

<p>3) Assuming 1 and 2 are correct, or close enough functionally speaking, I understand to guarantee performance I'd have to write an allocator of sorts to make sure the class object itself is large enough on instancing, and then copy the vectors in there myself and from there on refer to those.
I can probably hack my way to something like that if it's the only way to work through the problem, but I'd rather not hack it horribly if there are nice/smart ways to go about something like that. Any pointers on best practices and suggested methods would be hugely helpful (beyond ""don't use malloc it's not guaranteed contiguous"", that one I already have down :) ).</p>

<p>Anyway, I want to customise the error message for not accepting one of the boxes so I added the following into en.yml</p>

<p>You'll see that profile is nested under user - this is to stop ""Profile"" being put at the front of the error message <a href=""http://railsengineer.com/post/3920777973/rails-nested-form-validation-message"">(as explained here).</a></p>

<p>This gives me the error: </p>

The glow effect comes from two <code>DropShadowEffects</code>, which I wish to bind to the <code>Foreground Property</code> of the content control. The <code>Foreground Property</code> is of type <code>Brush</code> and the <code>DropShadowEffect.Color</code> is of type <code>Color</code>, so I need to convert between those two.</p>

<p>Whenever I try to set the glow color via the converter the glow effect stays black. It seems like the converter code never even gets passed. I did return a pre-defined color (no conversion) in the converter and even added a Debug.Break(), to no avail.</p>

<p>Can you tell me what I am doing wrong, or whether there are alternative, possibly better ways to implement a label with a glowing background.</p>

<p>The converter:</p>

<pre><code>public class ColorToBrushConverter : IValueConverter
{
    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture)
    {
        if (value == null) return null;

        if (value is Color)
        {
            Color color = (Color)value;
            BrushConverter bc = new BrushConverter();
            return bc.ConvertFrom(color);
        }

        Type type = value.GetType();
        throw new InvalidOperationException(""Unsupported type [""+type.Name+""]"");            
    }

    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture) {

        if (value is Brush)
        {
            Brush brush = (Brush)value;
            BrushConverter bc = new BrushConverter();
            return bc.ConvertTo(brush, typeof(Color));
        }

        Type type = value.GetType();

My question is how can i make it so that when the user clicks the next page in the pagination, the content is refreshed but the same tab is left open.</p>

<p>My plan on how to incorporate this into my current code is to use the url <code>mail.php?page=2&amp;tid=2</code></p>

<p>Where the page=2 is reference for the pagination that works fine but i want the tid (tab id) to make it so that that tab is the open one.</p>

<p>Here is the javascript for the tabs you might recognise it</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

    //Default Action
    $("".tab_content"").hide(); //Hide all content
    $(""ul.tabs li:first"").addClass(""active"").show(); //Activate first tab
    $("".tab_content:first"").show(); //Show first tab content

    //On Click Event
    $(""ul.tabs li"").click(function() {
        $(""ul.tabs li"").removeClass(""active""); //Remove any ""active"" class
        $(this).addClass(""active""); //Add ""active"" class to selected tab
        $("".tab_content"").hide(); //Hide all tab content
        var activeTab = $(this).find(""a"").attr(""href""); //Find the rel attribute value to identify the active tab + content
        $(activeTab).fadeIn(); //Fade in the active content
        return false;
    });

});
</code></pre>

<p>And the html for the tabs (had to comment out for the lists)</p>

<pre><code>//&lt;div id=""tabsX""&gt;   &lt;div id=""tabContent""&gt;   &lt;ul class=""tabs""&gt;
   // &lt;!--&lt;li&gt;&lt;a id=""all"" href=""#all"" class=""all""&gt;All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;--&gt;

    //&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#trash"" class=""trash""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   // 

   // &lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>AND the html for the tab content (only showing one as an example with no content as there will be too much to show)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""inbox"" class=""tab_content""&gt;
      &lt;div id=""inbox_header"" style=""display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle""&gt;

<p>I need some clarification on verifing if before the 'IN', there'are not any other strings or chars, just blank spaces.</p>

"11232604","1","11233712","","2012-06-27 18:21:22","","4","973","<p>I'm working on a simulation system that, among other things, allows for the execution of tasks in discrete simulated time steps.  Execution all occurs in the context of the simulation thread, but, from the perspective of an 'operator' using the system, they wish to behave asynchronously.  Thankfully the TPL, with the handy 'async/await' keywords, makes this fairly straightforward.  I have a primitive method on the Simulation like this:</p>

<pre><code>    public Task CycleExecutedEvent()
    {
        lock (_cycleExecutedBroker)
        {
            if (!IsRunning) throw new TaskCanceledException(""Simulation has been stopped"");
            return _cycleExecutedBroker.RegisterForCompletion(CycleExecutedEventName);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This is basically creating a new TaskCompletionSource and then returning a Task.  The purpose of this Task is to execute its continuation when the new 'ExecuteCycle' on the simulation occurs.</p>

<p>I then have some extension methods like this:</p>

<pre><code>    public static async Task WaitForDuration(this ISimulation simulation, double duration)
    {
        double startTime = simulation.CurrentSimulatedTime;
        do
        {
            await simulation.CycleExecutedEvent();
        } while ((simulation.CurrentSimulatedTime - startTime) &lt; duration);
    }

    public static async Task WaitForCondition(this ISimulation simulation, Func&lt;bool&gt; condition)
    {
        do
        {
            await simulation.CycleExecutedEvent();
        } while (!condition());
    }
</code></pre>

<p>These are very handy, then, for building sequences from an 'operator' perspective, taking actions based on conditions and waiting for periods of simulated time.  The issue I'm running into is that CycleExecuted occurs very frequently (roughly every few milliseconds if I'm running at fully accelerated speed).  Because these 'wait' helper methods register a new 'await' on each cycle, this causes a large turnover in TaskCompletionSource instances.</p>

<p>I've profiled my code and I've found that roughly 5.5% of my total CPU time is spent within these completions, of which only a negligible percentage is spent in the 'active' code.  Effectively all of the time is spent registering new completions while waiting for the triggering conditions to be valid.</p>

<p>My question: how can I improve performance here while still retaining the convenience of the async/await pattern for writing 'operator behaviors'?  I'm thinking I need something like a lighter-weight and/or reusable TaskCompletionSource, given that the triggering event occurs so frequently.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've been doing a bit more research and it sounds like a good option would be to create a custom implementation of the Awaitable pattern, which could tie directly into the event, eliminating the need for a bunch of TaskCompletionSource and Task instances.  The reason it could be useful here is that there are a lot of different continuations awaiting the CycleExecutedEvent and they need to await it frequently. So ideally I'm looking at a way to just queue up continuation callbacks, then call back everything in the queue whenever the event occurs.  I'll keep digging, but I welcome any help if folks know a clean way to do this.</p>

<hr>

<p>For anybody browsing this question in the future, here is the custom awaiter I put together:</p>

<pre><code>public sealed class CycleExecutedAwaiter : INotifyCompletion
{
    private readonly List&lt;Action&gt; _continuations = new List&lt;Action&gt;();

    public bool IsCompleted
    {
        get { return false; }
    }

    public void GetResult()
    {
    }

    public void OnCompleted(Action continuation)
    {
        _continuations.Add(continuation);
    }

    public void RunContinuations()
    {
        var continuations = _continuations.ToArray();
        _continuations.Clear();
        foreach (var continuation in continuations)
            continuation();
    }

    public CycleExecutedAwaiter GetAwaiter()
    {
        return this;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And in the Simulator:</p>

<pre><code>    private readonly CycleExecutedAwaiter _cycleExecutedAwaiter = new CycleExecutedAwaiter();

    public CycleExecutedAwaiter CycleExecutedEvent()
    {
        if (!IsRunning) throw new TaskCanceledException(""Simulation has been stopped"");
        return _cycleExecutedAwaiter;

<p>It's a bit funny, as the awaiter never reports Complete, but fires continues to call completions as they are registered; still, it works well for this application.  This reduces the CPU overhead from 5.5% to 2.1%.  It will likely still require some tweaking, but it's a nice improvement over the original.</p>

And the mainline usage, has to get the compressed blog, and then decompress it. Some sort of wrapper or ZipInputStream is fine.</p>

<p>These numbers each come out normalized to [-1, 1], with mean at 0. I clamp them to avoid exceptions, which I think are due to floating-point accuracy issues, but I am fairly sure my scaling factor is good enough for restricting the noise output to exactly this neighborhood in the ideal case.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's all details. The point is, here is a 256-by-256 array of noise:</p>

<p>I would like this function to be implementable in C# and not take minutes to run.</p>

<p>Once again, it shouldn't matter where the numbers come from (the question is about transforming one distribution into another, specifically a normal-like one to uniform).

The app is largely HTML+CSS+JS+jQuery based.</p>

<p><code>div.appList</code> shows a list of apps, and when clicked the app should launch. Only there's some trouble with this; For the list to be scrollable, I have to add <code>overflow: scroll;</code> to its parent. This works fine in Android 3.0+. In Android 2.x the list is still not scrollable.<br />
I said it worked fine in Android 3.0? Well, the scrolling does. Now the problem is that it doesn't register clicks. If the user taps an item in the list, the click event simply doesn't get triggered, because, I'm guessing, it's registered as the user scrolling through the list. Making the list unscrollable again makes the items clickable, but then again, the list is useless because you can only access the top few items.</p>

<p>Everything works fine in Android 4.0+</p>

<p>My current build implementation (using cx_Freeze) is below.  It successfully packages my program into an .exe that works properly on my machine.  However, when I try to port it to another Windows machine and run it, the GUI works but the system calls do not.  I figure this is because my current approach requires scrapy to be installed on that machine bc it uses a system call, but I don't really know how to work around that.  Would I have more luck using execute from scrapy.cmdline?  When I do that I get build errors about scrapystats.  Or should I try packaging it using win2exe?</p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

"8573369","1","8585025","","2011-12-20 09:35:18","","1","200","<p>I was trying to read a page from the same site using PHP. I came across this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/3620702/583539"">good discussion</a> and decided to use the <em>cURL</em> method suggested:</p>

<pre><code>function get_web_page( $url )
{
    $options = array(
        CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER =&gt; true,     // return web page
        CURLOPT_HEADER         =&gt; false,    // don't return headers
        CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION =&gt; true,     // follow redirects
        CURLOPT_ENCODING       =&gt; """",       // handle all encodings
        CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER    =&gt; true,     // set referer on redirect
        CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT =&gt; 120,      // timeout on connect
        CURLOPT_TIMEOUT        =&gt; 120,      // timeout on response
        CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS      =&gt; 10,       // stop after 10 redirects
    );

    $ch      = curl_init( $url );
    curl_setopt_array( $ch, $options );
    $content = curl_exec( $ch );
    $err     = curl_errno( $ch );
    $errmsg  = curl_error( $ch );
    $header  = curl_getinfo( $ch );
    curl_close( $ch );

    $header['errno']   = $err;
    $header['errmsg']  = $errmsg;
    $header['content'] = $content;
    return $header;
}

//Now get the webpage
$data = get_web_page( ""https://www.google.com/"" );

//Display the data (optional)
echo ""&lt;pre&gt;"" . $data['content'] . ""&lt;/pre&gt;"";
</code></pre>

<p>So, for my case, I called the <code>get_web_page</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>$target_url = ""http://"" . $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] . ""/press-release/index.html"";           
$page = get_web_page($target_url);
</code></pre>

<p>The thing that I couldn't fathom is it worked on all of my test servers but one. I've verified that the <em>cURL</em> is available on the server in question. Also, setting `$target_url = ""http://www.google.com"" worked fine. So, I am pretty positive that the culprit has nothing to do with the <em>cURL</em> library.</p>

<p>Can it be because <strong>some servers block themselves from being ""crawled""</strong> by this type of script? Or, maybe I just missed something here?</p>

<p>Thanks beforehand.</p>

<p>I tried to resolve this issue by creating a function that iterates over an array (passed as an argument) and creates global variables via the ""variable variables"" feature, and then calling it in every page for <code>$_POST</code>, <code>$_GET</code> and <code>$_SESSION</code>. This is the code:</p>

<pre><code>function fix_global_array($array) {
  foreach($array as $key =&gt; $value){
    if(!isset($$key)) {
      global $$key;
      $$key = $value;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this function is that the condition <code>isset($$key)</code> is never true, thus the code inside the brackets is always executed and overrides the previous declarations.</p>

<p>Is there any explanation for this behaviour? I read the PHP documentation where it states that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please note that variable variables cannot be used with PHP's Superglobal arrays within functions or class methods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but I don't understand if it's related to my problem or not (to tell the truth, I don't understand what it means either, I couldn't find any example).</p>

<p>PS: please, don't bother telling me that using global variables and/or variable variables is bad programming, I know this only too well by myself, but the other option would be modifying about 2.700 files with a thousand lines of code each line per line, and I'm the only programmer here... But if you know a better solution to get rid of all those ""undefined variable"" warnings, you can make my day.</p>

<p>PPS: and be patient with my english too ^_^</p>

<p>I'm trying to simulate a player jump like in Super Mario Bros. First, I used a simple contact listener to have a boolean value false when contact occurs but the contact occurs with walls grounds, everything. So, I'm now trying to attach another small body to the bottom of player as foot sensor using WeldJoint. But I couldn't achieve that. The WeldJoint wouldn't stick at all. I tried to create the WeldJoint on an update thread, nothing. I tried with the setposition method to update the sensor position with the player's, but it just positions the sensor below ground.
Any suggestions would be appreciated. Here is how i tried to create WeldJoint.</p>

<p>Player and sensor</p>

<pre><code>mPlayer = new AnimatedSprite(100, 150, PlayerTextureRegion);
PlayerBody = PhysicsFactory.createBoxBody(this.mPhysicsWorld,mPlayer,BodyType.DynamicBody, PLAYER_FIXTURE_DEF);
this.mPhysicsWorld.registerPhysicsConnector(new PhysicsConnector(mPlayer, PlayerBody, true, true));
mScene.getLastChild().attachChild(mPlayer);

final Shape mSensor= new Rectangle(mPlayer.getX()+4,mPlayer.getY()+mPlayer.getHeight(),10,4);
final Body SensorBody = PhysicsFactory.createBoxBody(this.mPhysicsWorld,mSensor,BodyType.DynamicBody, SENSOR_FIXTURE_DEF);
this.mPhysicsWorld.registerPhysicsConnector(new PhysicsConnector(mSensor, SensorBody, true, true));
mScene.getLastChild().attachChild(mSensor);

mScene.registerUpdateHandler(new IUpdateHandler() {

        @Override
        public void reset() { }

        @Override
        public void onUpdate(final float pSecondsElapsed) {
             this.createJoint(PlayerBody,SensorBody);
             .......
</code></pre>

<p>Joint Method</p>

<pre><code>private void createJoint(Body Anchor, Body Sensor){
    final WeldJointDef join = new WeldJointDef();
    join.initialize(Anchor,Sensor,Anchor.getWorldCenter());
    this.mPhysicsWorld.createJoint(join);
}

<pre><code>TCHAR buff[256];
DWORD dwSz = 256;
GetUserNameEx(NameFullyQualifiedDN, buff, &amp;dwSz);

<p>The code above works at no time if I run it from a user-mode process (from a user desktop.) But when I call that API from a system service it does not return for 3-4 seconds! (I should say that the code above may be called on a system that is not a member of an Active Directory domain.)</p>

<p>So my first question is, why would calling it from a service be an issue?</p>

<p>And second question, if I call that API when my service starts and later cache the result in a global variable and later on use it instead, what are the chances that a Distinguished Name changes on that system?</p>

In c++, this may like:</p>

<p>Java calls by reference, so if we change a object in a method, the change is visible by the caller. But, int is not a class, so I could't make is like this in java:</p>

        Thickness thickness = new Thickness(101,-11,362,250);
        line.Margin = thickness;
        line.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Visible;
        line.StrokeThickness = 4;
        line.Stroke = System.Windows.Media.Brushes.Black;
        line.X1 = 10;
        line.X2 = 40;
        line.Y1 = 70;
        line.Y2 = 70;
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is I can draw 7 lines, then toggle their visibility as required for different numbers. I'm sure this can be done many ways, but why can't I draw lines in code like this?</p>

I'm new here and new to programming but I'm running into some trouble while doing things so let me explain.</p>

<p>I've tried to write a Python 2.7 script that my friends can run as an .exe, introduces itself when launched and asks the user if he/she wants to open a word document(outside the Python script in the same folder as the executable).
<strong>It would be awesome if there is a way to continue the script when the user clicks on the console window again instead of having to use the sleep(8)+sleep(5) after opening the word document.</strong></p>

<p>After that it should explain some things about the word document and then the user gets the option to reply whatever they want to a question. The reply of which will be sent to my own mail after pressing enter(used a smtp for that).
After that they get the option to either close the script or read a lame joke that I still need to think of.</p>

<p>Ok that's all for the script that I had in mind.</p>

<p>Now I know that no friend of mine knows how to open a .py script, that's why I'm trying to make a regular executable for them(when the windows version is complete I still need a .app version for mac but that's a later concern).</p>

<p>I've used cx_Freeze to make that happen and worked my way through until all the stuff that I wanted to work actually worked.</p>

<p>The word document opens in word with the cx freeze version(don't know if there's a more general way for it then webbrowser.open but I don't know what path the files will be on my friend's their computers so I can't work with the subprocess one that actually points to a path) and everything else works as well.
Now I made this on a 64 bit Win 8.1 PC.
I've tested this on my other 32 bit Win 7 PC and it worked perfectly.
But when I sent it to my dad who also has a 32 bit Win 7 PC it showed a <em>""this version of file is not compatible with the version of windows you're running""</em> error. Now I've had my fair shares of compatibility errors with downloaded games so I tried to use different Win compatibility modes but nothing worked.</p>

<p>So now I've tried to make an .exe using pyinstaller(including pywin32 stuffs) and the same problem persists. It works on my PC but not on the 32 bit Win 7 PC from my dad.
Running it as admin didn't work, changing compatibility stuff didn't work, trying different .exe stuffs didn't work. So basically I ran out of ideas.</p>

<p>Can any of you help me please?
If I need to install things, for instance, to add 32 bit dependencies or something then I would like to request some steps to install it since I'm really new to this.</p>

<p>For example, here is the class I am testing.</p>

<pre><code>using Microsoft.Practices.Unity;
using System.Threading;

namespace Client.Engine
{
    public sealed class Uploader : IUploader
    {
        private readonly IUnityContainer _container;

            _container = container;
        }

        public void PerformUpload(CancellationToken token, int batchSize)
        {
            token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
            _container.Resolve&lt;IUploadModule&gt;(""Clients"").Upload(token, batchSize);

            token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
            _container.Resolve&lt;IUploadModule&gt;(""Patients"").Upload(token, batchSize);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the unit tests I set up</p>

<pre><code>[TestClass()]
public class UploadClientsTests : UploadModuleTestsBase
{
    [TestMethod()]
    public override void UploaderRegrestrationTest()
    {
        PerformRegistrationTest(""Clients"");
    }
}

[TestClass()]
public class UploadPatientsTests : UploadModuleTestsBase
{
    [TestMethod()]
    public override void UploaderRegrestrationTest()
    {
        PerformUpladerRegistrationTest(""Patients"");
    }
}

public class UploadPatientsTests : UploadModuleTestsBase
{
    protected static void PerformUpladerRegistrationTest(string moduleName)
    {
        var container = new UnityContainer();
        var mocker = new AutoMoqer(container);
        var random = new Random();
        int batchSize = random.Next(int.MaxValue);
        var token = new CancellationToken();

        var uploadModuleMock = new Mock&lt;IUploadModule&gt;();
        uploadModuleMock.Setup(module =&gt; module.Upload(token, batchSize)).Verifiable();

        container.RegisterInstance(typeof(IUploadModule), moduleName, uploadModuleMock.Object, new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager());
        container.RegisterInstance(typeof(IUploadModule), Mock.Of&lt;IUploadModule&gt;());
        var uploader = mocker.Resolve&lt;Uploader&gt;();
        uploader.PerformUpload(token, batchSize);

        uploadModuleMock.Verify();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I run in to is Unity 2.0 does not fall back to the default instance if a named type is not available. So if I comment out the <code>_container.Resolve&lt;IUploadModule&gt;(""Patients"")</code> line the clients test works perfectly, and if I comment out  <code>_container.Resolve&lt;IUploadModule&gt;(""Clients"")</code> the patients test works perfectly, I just don't know how to make it so both can co-exist.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: In normal operation I am restringing the two objects like this.</p>

<pre><code>public static Bootstrap(IUnityContainer container)
{
    container.RegisterType&lt;IUploadModule, UploadClients&gt;(""Clients"", new HierarchicalLifetimeManager());
    container.RegisterType&lt;IUploadModule, UploadPatients&gt;(""Patients"", new HierarchicalLifetimeManager());
}

I put something together from a tutorial but have additional question bec a few things dont seem right. What I have so far is a WPF application with a shell.xaml window that has section placeholders using prism regions. In addition, I have a bootstrapper class that register modules which will fill in the different regions in the shell.xaml window. In the modules which are class libraries I have the initialize function setting the views and viewmodels. I have only two regions in this application the navigation and the workspace. I have 2 buttons on the navigation and they change the view in the workspace. The workspace views are in their own modules. So at this point each workspace view has its own class library module. In a big application this seems unreasonable of having each view have its own class library. I wanted to know how can I have multiple views and viewmodels in one class library and swap them in and out. If you have a good step by step tutorial that would be great.</p>

<li>Call the thread <code>eventLoop</code>;</li>
<li><code>eventLoop</code> locks the mutex by <code>pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;s_startupMutex)</code>;</li>

<p>My understanding is the following (correct me if wrong):</p>

<ol>
<li>Lock the mutex exclusively for this task. If the mutex is not available right now, it will sleep until it can get it.</li>
<li>The mutex must later on be released by the same task that acquired it. Recursive locking is not allowed.</li>

<p>Whenever I have both tests running in the same session and in parallel by Selenium via Webinator, IE seems to hang when I send any click action to the page.</p>

<p>I'm not able to use the solution suggested <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/7854838/1464825"">here</a>, since SpecFlow generates the underlying C# code automatically. My solution is designed like <a href=""https://gist.github.com/3100313"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> (the full code is available as a gist):</p>

<pre><code>_multipleBrowsers.RunTest(web =&gt; web.GoToUrl(""http://localhost/PROJECT/Authentication/Registration""));
</code></pre>

<p>What happens is that I instantiate a new IWebManager for every browser I need to test. Then, I call the delegate action, using the browser instance. It goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>        foreach (var web in _webManagers)
        {
            Debug.WriteLine(""Running test with "" + web.Config.Browser);

            action(web);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>This way the tests run almost in parallel. It pops up a browser, execute the action, then the other browser, and so forth.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on how to overcome this ChromeDriver issue? Should I change my testing approach with SpecFlow for multiple browsers?</p>

<h2>INSTALLATION</h2>

<p>To configure, use</p>

<pre><code>DIR/configure OPTIONS
</code></pre>

<p>in the directory in which you want to build, where DIR designates the 
directory in which you have unpacked the source (can be .).  Use</p>

<pre><code>DIR/configure --help
</code></pre>

<p>to see the options.</p>

<p>Next, you can simply type</p>

<pre><code>make
</code></pre>

<p>to build,</p>

<pre><code>make install
</code></pre>

<p>to install, and </p>

<pre><code>make install-doc
</code></pre>

<p>to compile and install the documentation file gjdb.pdf.</p>

<p>To use gjdb from Emacs, arrange to load it in your initialization
(.emacs) file with the command</p>

<pre><code>(load ""DIR/gjdb"")
</code></pre>

<p>where DIR is the directory in which 'make install' put gjdb.el (see the 
output of configure --help), or just</p>

<pre><code>(load ""gjdb"")
</code></pre>

<p>if you have put DIR on Emacs's load path.</p>

<p>Does this mean there will be two types of caching: fragment and active support caching for two different types of data?</p>

<p>For example. In the view I could have:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% cache 'videos_and_photos', :expires_in =&gt; 24.hours do %&gt;

I'm more interested in a secure web socket connection (<strong>wss</strong>) for Node.js and socket.io</p>

<p>I don't use Node.js for HTTP requests. I use the socket.io module that works with Node.js to deliver messages in real time to my applications. I only use node for the web socket connection.</p>

<p>I'll explain breifly what my setup is. I use Django as my HTTP backend. Users make a request to Django, Django forwards the contents of that request to Redis, Node.js listens in on one of Redis' channels, it processes the contents and sends the message to the appropriate recipient.</p>

<p>Pretty simple and straight forward. Everything works fine. But I'm afraid that the websocket connection to Node.js is unsecure. When Node.js sends a message to the recipient, I don't want anyone snooping in between and intercepting the message. I would like to make sure my users feel safe and trust the service I have built for them.</p>

<p>I looked into self-signed certificates and certificates from a CA. Both provide the same level of security. Since I am only using Node.js for socket.io and not serving HTTP content, a self-signed certificate will work absolutely fine (the service I have built is for mobile, not for browsers!)</p>

<p>Below is my implentation of socket.io:</p>

<pre><code>var io = require('socket.io').listen(8000);
var redis = require('socket.io/node_modules/redis')
var redisChannelConnection = redis.createClient(6000, ""12.345.678.9"");
var redisServer = redis.createClient(6000, ""23.456.789.1"");

// Subscribe to Redis Channel
redisChannelConnection.subscribe('messages');

io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {
     socket.emit('message', 'Hello World');
     }
</code></pre>

<p>I have just written up a simple connection function so far. It works as a normal websocket connection. But I would like to make it a <strong>secure websocket connection</strong>. How many I go about doing this?</p>

<p>We're totally new to submitting anything to Paypal, I read the guide on <a href=""https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/lifecycle/goingLive/#register"" rel=""nofollow"">this link</a> and it couldn't be less clear on how to fill the form. </p>

<p>I filled the form to upload the mobile app, but we tripped with several doubts along the way, here I will list them:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>our app is cross platform and we can only choose one platform, do we
have to submit both Android and iOS for revision separately? Even
though it's the same app?</p></li>
<li><p>we filled the form but there was nowhere to place an ipa or apk, only
a field asking for additional files like ad hoc stuff and such, how
do we submit our build for them to test?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have to be honest, PayPal guides aren't clear and don't explain deeply many of the processes, as if we have already the knowledge of what to do, we searched the web for guides on how to go live but nothing came across our search.</p>

<p>We developed our app using Titanium Studio and the PayPal supports documents treat every submitted app as if they were natively developed, we are using <a href=""https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_modules/tree/master/paypal"" rel=""nofollow"">a Titanium's module to make all the PayPal work</a>, so we have no idea what API calls are made, apparently the module uses Adaptive API calls but we're not sure on this, we only make simple payments, do we still need to submit the app or should we be doing something else?.</p>

<p>As you can see we have zero experience with PayPal and while we wait for a response from PayPal and finish to pass every service we use to Production, we are trying to understand  what to do with this submitting app phase.</p>

<p>We contacted PayPal support asking for a detailed explanation on what to do on our situation but no one has contacted us at all.</p>

<p>On top of that, the one or two times I had to turn over something written using XLST to someone else, it represented a huge barrier to entry. Functional programming is unfamiliar to the average coder or scripter and the learning curve is very steep.</p>

<p>XML is here to stay, and there will always be a need to manipulate it somehow. There are frameworks that use XML that are perhaps less used than they could be because they lean heavily on XSLT for presentation.</p>

<p>I am not opposed to XPATH. In fact, I consider it to be straightforward and quite useful.</p>

<p><img src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/151329/schema.png"" alt=""An ER diagram with 5 entities: messages, submissions, attachments, assignments, and lectures""></p>

<p>Notice that the <code>attachments</code> table will subsequently be used for the messages', submissions', assignments', and lectures' attachments.</p>

<p>The problem is with the 3 one-to-one relationships between <code>attachments</code> and <code>messages</code>, <code>submissions</code>, and <code>assignments</code>. According to CakePHP's conventions, <code>Message belongsTo Attachment</code> (and <code>Attachment hasOne Message</code>) because <code>Message</code> contains the foreign key (the same thing applies to the other 2 relationships). Of course, it makes more sense to say that <code>Message hasOne Attachment</code> (and that <code>Attachment belongsTo Message</code>). If we only had <code>messages</code> and <code>attachments</code>, it would be easy to ""<em>properly orient</em>"" the relationship by moving the foreign key to <code>attachments</code>.</p>

<p>But the problem again is that <code>messages</code>, <code>submissions</code>, <code>assignments</code>, and <code>lectures</code> have relationships with the same <code>attachments</code> table. One way to get the ""<em>semantically correct</em>"" relationships is to have 4 different <code>Attachment</code> models: <code>MessageAttachment</code>, <code>SubmissionAttachment</code>, <code>AssignmentAttachment</code>, and <code>LectureAttachment</code>.</p>

<p>Assuming we are only interested in retrieving the attachment of a certain message, submission, or assignment, <strong>is it OK to use these <em>semantically reversed</em> associations, or should we <em>properly orient</em> them by separating <code>Attachment</code> into 4 different models as mentioned above?</strong></p>

<p>It seems simple but when i used a $.each method in my success function, I created a paragraph tag for every object that had the attribute I was organizing the objects by, and when I tried to use the sort method, I could only compare two or three objects at a time and not iterate through a long list of several objects.</p>

<p>Say the desired output looked something like this</p>

<pre><code>     &lt;div id=""accordion""&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Electrition&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;jon&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;jill&lt;/li&gt;         
       &lt;/ul&gt;
       &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Engineer&lt;/p&gt;
       &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;jerry&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;laura&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

<p>Without authentication (i.e. with anonymous authentication) on the server I have successfully retrieved data in JSON format with the CORS ""Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *"" header in place and in JSONP format without the header.</p>

<p>Now I'm trying to understand the behaviour when authentication and the CORS header is in place with JSON (not JSONP) format data.</p>

<p>The following jQuery code will send a request to the server, which in turn responds with ""HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"".</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    url: myUrl,
    dataType: 'json',
    cache: false,
    complete: function () { /* do stuff */ },
    timeout: 5000,
    data: myData
});
</code></pre>

<p>The following jQuery code does not make a request to the server and immediately throws an exception ""Access to restricted URI denied"", code 1012.</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    url: myUrl,
    dataType: 'json',
    cache: false,

    timeout: 5000,
    username: ""chris"",
    password: ""password"",
    data: myData
});

<p>I understand and expect the first case. Can anyone explain to me the exception in the second case? I would have expected the request to be made at least.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;controlsToolkit:ListBoxDragDropTarget mswindows:DragDrop.AllowDrop=""True"" HorizontalContentAlignment=""Stretch"" VerticalContentAlignment=""Stretch""&gt;
        &lt;ListBox ItemsSource=""{Binding MyItemControls}"" ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollBarVisibility=""Disabled""&gt;

            &lt;/ListBox.ItemsPanel&gt;
        &lt;/ListBox&gt;
&lt;/controlsToolkit:ListBoxDragDropTarget&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works as expected at runtime and looks fine in Visual Studio 2008. However, when I try to open my UserControl in Blend I get <strong>XamlParseException: [Line: 0 Position: 0]</strong> and I can not see anything in the design view. More specifically Blend complains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The element ""ListBoxDragDropTarget"" could not be displayed because of a problem with System.Windows.Controls.ListBoxDragDropTarget: TargetType mismatch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My silverlight application is referencing System.Windows.Controls.Toolkit from the Nov. 2009 toolkit release, and I've made sure to include these namespace declarations for the ListBoxDragDropTarget:</p>

<pre><code>xmlns:controlsToolkit=""clr-namespace:System.Windows.Controls;assembly=System.Windows.Controls.Toolkit""
xmlns:mswindows=""clr-namespace:Microsoft.Windows;assembly=System.Windows.Controls.Toolkit""
</code></pre>

<p>If I comment out the ListBoxDragDropTarget control wrapper and just leave the ListBox I can see everything fine in the design view without errors. Furthermore, I realized this is happening with a variety of Silverlight Toolkit controls because if I comment out ListBoxDragDropTarget and replace it with</p>

<pre><code>&lt;controlsToolkit:BusyIndicator /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>the same exact error occurs in Blend. What is even weirder is that if I start a brand new silverlight application in blend I can add these toolkit elements without any kind of error, so it seems like something dumb that is happening with my project references to the toolkit assemblies.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure this has something to do with loading the default styles for the toolkit controls from its generic.xaml, since the error has to do with the TargetType and Blend is probably trying to load up the default styles.</p>

<p>Has anyone encountered this issue before or have any ideas as to what may be my problem?</p>

Most of the pertinent metadata for these records is maintained in a single partitioned table by date (month).  We are going to start receiving up to 20 individual codes associated with this data. The intent is to ultimately allow searching by these codes.</p>

<p>What would be the most effective way to store this data to minimize search response time?  The database is Oracle 11gR2.</p>

<p>Some options I was taking into consideration:</p>

<p>(1) Create a separate table with main record id and code values.  Something like</p>

 2        CC
 2        DD

<p>Concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li>would probably require a bitmap index on the code column, but the table is highly transactional so no bitmap</li>
<li>table would get huge over time with up to 20 codes per main record</li>
</ul>

<p>(2) Create a separate table partitioned by code values.</p>

<p>Concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li>partition maintenance for new codes</li>
<li>search performance</li>
</ul>

<p>(3) Add a XMLType column to existing table and format the codes for each record into XML and create an XMLIndex on the column:  Something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;C1&gt;AA&lt;/C1&gt;

An idea behind the filter is to iterate to estimate best results (similar to Monte Carlo). I have a base class <code>ExperimentalData()</code> which has basic methods to gather the data etc. I am going to build another classes to have different filters. A filter's class is always derived from <code>ExperimentalData()</code>. </p>

<p>Inside my <code>class ParFilter(ExperimentalData)</code> I have the method <code>def particleFilter(self, N=1000)</code> to run filter and get the desired estimation. As I need to have access to the data during iteration, inside I build <code>class Iterator(object)</code> where I going to proceed the data.</p>

<p>I have a problem with passing data into class <code>Iterator()</code>. I try most case what I thought should work but has <code>AttributeError: 'Iterator' object has no attribute 'myData'</code>. Eventually I am able to pass some data but it is not the same data-object I expected. </p>

<p>My code reduced to illustrate example:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class ExperimentalData(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.xTrueSource = 100
        self.yTrueSource = -7
        print 'source %s  %s' % (self.xTrueSource,self.yTrueSource)
        xSampPoints = np.arange(0,200)
        yTrueSignal = 100/(np.sqrt((self.xTrueSource - xSampPoints)**2 + (self.yTrueSource)**2))
        ySampPoints = yTrueSignal+np.random.randn(200)
        self.myData = pd.DataFrame({'x':xSampPoints,'ySamp':ySampPoints,'yTrue':yTrueSignal})
        #print self.myData
    def __str__(self, rows=2):           
        dfPrintStart = (self.myData[:rows]).to_string()
        dfPrintEnd =(self.myData[-rows:]).to_string()
        stringToPrint='\nPRINTNG INITIAL DATAFRAME FIRST %d ROWS and LAST %d ROWS \n %s\n...\n%s\n'\
                        % (rows, rows, dfPrintStart, dfPrintEnd)
        return stringToPrint

class ParFilter(ExperimentalData):

    def particleFilter(self, N=1000):
        '''function runs particle filter'''
        class Iterator(object):
            def __init__(self):
                '''initialise all values for iteration'''
                self.iteration = 0
                frameToWork = ParFilter().myData                
                print 'FROM CLASS Iterator.__init__ \n%s' % frameToWork
            def iterate(self):
                '''performing one step at the time'''
                self.iteration += 1
                print self.iteration
        myPartFilter = Iterator()
        for n in range(N):
            myPartFilter.iterate()
        return myPartFilter

if __name__ == '__main__':
    data = ParFilter()
    print data
    data.particleFilter(10)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when I initialise my class I have dataFrame with particular values, but when I do the step: <code>frameToWork = ParFilter().myData</code> instead of taking the same data-object I produce new object with different data. Snapshot of the output:</p>

<pre><code>PRINTNG INITIAL DATAFRAME FIRST 2 ROWS and LAST 2 ROWS 
   x     ySamp     yTrue
0  0  0.510414  0.997559
1  1  1.522934  1.007585
...
       x     ySamp     yTrue
198  198  1.508216  1.017815
199  199  2.409181  1.007585

FROM CLASS Iterator.__init__ 
   x     ySamp     yTrue
0  0  0.727060  0.997559
1  1  0.631976  1.007585
</code></pre>

<p>The first value of <code>ySamp</code> in initialisation is 0.510414 and it should be the same in <code>Iterator</code> instead of 0.727060. So I create new object.</p>

<p>I cannot figure out how to get the original <code>myData</code> object into <code>Iterator</code> I try:</p>

<pre><code>    class Iterator(ParFilter):
        def __init__(self):
            '''initialise all values for iteration'''
            self.iteration = 0
            frameToWork = self.myData 
</code></pre>

<p>with <code>AttributeError: 'Iterator' object has no attribute 'myData'</code>. </p>

<p>I try: <code>class Iterator(self.ParFilter)</code> with <code>AttributeError: 'ParFilter' object has no attribute 'ParFilter'</code> and some more but no results. </p>

<li><strong>At the end of this operation, I need to determine if the Cache by the name of 'dSummary' has been re-inserted or refreshed from database since the long operation began (i.e. while the operation was in progress).</strong></li>

<p>The code I use to insert cache item is as below:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong> </p>

<p>After getting so many replies, I think a possible foolproof approach would be to store a guid string along with the List object in Cache. Then I could simply compare the guid string property of the object stored in Cache before and after the long operation. If they are the same then Cache[""dSummary""] has not been re-inserted, else it has been re-inserted.
So I would need  to use the following extended class of 'Doc' class.</p>

<pre><code>public class DocX : Doc
 {

<pre class=""lang-scala prettyprint-override""><code>/* producer creates an observable and sends it to the worker */
object Producer extends Actor {
  val toTwenty : Observable[Int] = Observable.interval(1 second).take(20)

  def receive = {
    case o : Observable[Int] =&gt;
      o.subscribe( onNext =&gt; println )
  }

  worker ! toTwenty
}


/* worker which returns squares of even numbers */
object Worker extends Actor {
  def receive = {
    case o : Observable[Int] =&gt; 
       sender ! o filter { _ % 2 == 0 } map { _^2 }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Please treat this as pseudo-code; It doesn't compile). Note I am <code>send</code>ing Observables from one actor to another. I'd like to understand :</p>

<ul>
<li>Would Akka and RX synchronize access to the Observable automatically?</li>
<li>The <code>Observable</code> can't be sent over a distributed system - it's a reference to an object in local memory. However, would it work locally?</li>
<li>Suppose in this trivial example, work would be scheduled on the <code>subscribe</code> call in the <code>Producer</code>. Could I split the work so that it was done on each actor separately?</li>
</ul>

<p>Digression : I've seen some projects that look to combine RX and Actors:</p>

<p><a href=""http://jmhofer.johoop.de/?p=507"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jmhofer.johoop.de/?p=507</a> and
<a href=""https://github.com/jmhofer/rxjava-akka"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jmhofer/rxjava-akka</a></p>

<p>But these are different in that they don't simply pass the <code>Observable</code> as a message between actors. They first call <code>subscribe()</code> to get the values , then send these to an actors mailbox, and create a new <code>Observable</code> out of this. Or am I mistaken?</p>

<p>I have a job composed of 3 different workings (3 out of 5, which is the maximum workings I can have for a job). 
In my SQL database, the table.field corresponding to those workings is job.phase, so when I put, in my report details, the field ""job.phase"", I get 3 rows for that job.</p>

<p>The point is that my report printout always has to show 5 different text objects (one below the other), corresponding to the descriptions of all the 5 possible table.field-records, and a 'X' should appear next to text objects when each one of the workings listed there is a part of my job (otherwise nothing should appear). </p>

<p>What I have done is the following:
- created a subreport containing the ""job.phase"" field
- put it near my first text object
- specified in my subreport the following ""show string"" formula: 
  <em>if <code>job.phase</code> = 'working1' then 'X' else ''</em> 
and it works: a X appears if working1 is part of my job, nothing appears if working1 is not part of my job.
Then I have created 4 subreports more, equal to the first one, and specified the same for job.phase = working2, working3, working4 and working5, <strong>BUT</strong>, after doing that, no X is shown (even though working 1, 2 and 3 are part of my job)...</p>

<p>Is there anybody who can help me, please? It's so frustrating...</p>

It doesn't recognize basic groovy, for instance I start typing ""def"" to define a variable then hit space and it will autocomplete to ""Default"", similarly if I try to type in ""return"" it autocompletes to ""RETURN"" while I am typing as soon as I hit space, which is very annoying.</p>

<p>So I have that function <code>getData</code>.  I use it to load the data in using the soundcloud api.  I have a form at the top that uses getData to load a new user's Soundcloud data in.  I also call the getData function in the controller so that there is an example on the page upon loading.</p>

<p>The problem is when I try to load a new user's data from a <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> I want to be able to click on the user to see and sort their likes.</p>

<p>How do I 'clear' the function or the global namespace (am I even refering to the right thing)? How can I reuse the getData function with a new variable?</p>

<p>Here is the method that makes the call that fails.</p>

<pre><code> //This method is in the class that extends DataHelper (See note on tutorial)
    public void createSample(Sample sample)//next action form
    {

                        SAMPLE_NAME + "") "" + "" VALUES ("" + id + "","" + name + "")"";

<p>2-Instead of changing the pixels just draw stuff over other stuff with the graphics methods, and cleaning the canvas each frame (e.g to draw a rectangle just use graphics.drawRect(...) </p>

<p>But this raises a 500 Internal Server Error - checking Apache2's <code>error.log</code> and <code>rewrite.log</code>, this is because <code>.htaccess</code> is causing an infinite redirect, and is appending <code>app/webroot</code> to the URI.</p>

<p>From my understanding, the <code>L</code> flag here should indicate 'last rule' - I'm assuming that this error is due to my poor understanding of <code>mod_rewrite</code>, but I'm not sure exactly where this is happening.

<p>Update: On a side note: Instead of immediately trying GetObject, one could try to check if the key actually exists in the cache and only then retrieve it from the cache. However, if I am not mistaken, there is no other way to do a check other than calling GetObject and catching the exception like in the sample above. For a scenario where one would just want to know if an item exists, that doesn't seem to be ideal. Maybe an ""Exists()"" method would be a nice to have in Akavache? Or maybe I am missing something?</p>

<p>Update2: Changing the example to not use an async method in the constructor. Just to prove a point that that is not the issue.</p>

<p>Update3: Removing the call from the constructor. When I call BlockingGetExternalUser from anywhere in my code, the await will still hang.</p>

I have a utility method to get a parameter from a http request, or an empty string if the http request is null and am trying to test it with spock. My test looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>package foo.bar.test

import foo.bah.HttpRequestPropertyLoader
import spock.lang.Unroll
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest
import spock.lang.Specification

class HttpRequestPropertyLoaderTest extends Specification {

    HttpRequestPropertyLoader subjectUnderTest
    def result

    def setup() {
        subjectUnderTest = new HttpRequestPropertyLoader()
    }

    @Unroll(""When my http request is #nullOrNot then when I get parameter from it the response=#response"" )
    def ""Test load data from request""() {
        given:
        HttpServletRequest mockHttpRequest = Mock()
        mockHttpRequest.getAttribute(""foo"") &gt;&gt; ""bar""
        when:
        result = subjectUnderTest.loadStringFromHttpRequest(httpRequest, ""foo"")
        then:
        result == response
        where:
        httpRequest     | response | nullOrNot
        null            |  """"      | ""null""
        mockHttpRequest | ""bar""    | ""not null""

<p>However, when I run this test, I get the following error:</p>

<p><code>groovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: mockHttpRequest for class: foo.bar.test.HttpRequestPropertyLoaderTest at foo.bar.test.HttpRequestPropertyLoaderTest.Test load data from request(HttpRequestPropertyLoaderTest.groovy)</code></p>

<p>After doing some research, I understand that the <code>where</code> block is run before the <code>given</code> block, hence the error, but was just wondering if there was a workaround?</p>

<p>I know that to use a variable from outside the test, I would need to annotate the variable with the <code>@Shared</code> annotation, which seems bad practice to me. Every test should run completely separate from the others, so don't really want to have an object that keeps it's state between tests.</p>

<p>Is it possible to setup Mock objects to be returned from the where block any other way?</p>

<pre><code>public class StringActivity {

public String getArtist() {
    return(artist);

public void setArtist(String artist) {
    this.artist=artist;

public String toString() {

<pre><code>public class AlbumActivity extends Activity {
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    StringActivity sA = new StringActivity();

    String asd = sA.getArtist();
    TextView textview = new TextView(this);
    textview.setText(""Hello "" + asd + "" World!"");
    setContentView(textview);
}}
</code></pre>

<p>The hello world is there just because to see that there is nothing wrong with the textview. Maybe the problem is that it don't refresh (it's stay the same from the launch of the program - because when I give a value for the artist string in the StringActivity class then it shows, but when I click on an item it stay the same) or there is another problem?

<p>We have a Mule flow that alternates reads from one database with inserts to another, all wrapped inside a transactional scope.  In this particular case, one of the later insertions fails and we expect everything to roll back.  </p>

<p>When we look in the logs, we see an exception (e.g., duplicate PRIMARY KEY) for the second insertion (i.e., BulkInsertInstanceToCache in the example below). When we look in the database, we see the data from the first insert (BulkInsertActivityToCache in the example below).  We expected all data to be gone.</p>

I want to retrieve the top 15 messages (unread or read, it doesn't matter) and display just the subjects and sender name (or address) but don't know how to display the contents of the inbox.</p>

<p>Here is my code so far (successful connection)</p>

<pre><code>import imaplib

mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com')
mail.login('mygmail@gmail.com', 'somecrazypassword')
mail.list()
mail.select('inbox')

#need to add some stuff in here

mail.logout()
</code></pre>

<p>I believe this should be simple enough, I'm just not familiar enough with the commands for the imaplib library.  Any help would be must appreciated...</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
thanks to Julian I can iterate through each message and retrieve the entire contents with: </p>

<pre><code>typ, data = mail.search(None, 'ALL')
for num in data[0].split():
   typ, data = mail.fetch(num, '(RFC822)')
   print 'Message %s\n%s\n' % (num, data[0][1])
mail.close()
</code></pre>

<p>but I'm wanting just the subject and the sender. Is there a imaplib command for these items or will I have to parse the entire contents of data[0][1] for the text: Subject, and Sender?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
OK, got the subject and sender part working but the iteration (1, 15) is done by desc order apparently showing me the oldest messages first.  How can I change this?  I tried doing this:</p>

<pre><code>for i in range( len(data[0])-15, len(data[0]) ):
     print data
</code></pre>

<p>but that just gives me <code>None</code> for all 15 iterations... any ideas? I've also tried <code>mail.sort('REVERSE DATE', 'UTF-8', 'ALL')</code> but gmail doesnt support the .sort() function</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
Figured out a way to do it: </p>

<pre><code>#....^other code is the same as above except need to import email module
mail.select('inbox')
typ, data = mail.search(None, 'ALL')
ids = data[0]
id_list = ids.split()
#get the most recent email id
latest_email_id = int( id_list[-1] )

#iterate through 15 messages in decending order starting with latest_email_id
#the '-1' dictates reverse looping order
for i in range( latest_email_id, latest_email_id-15, -1 ):
   typ, data = mail.fetch( i, '(RFC822)' )

   for response_part in data:
      if isinstance(response_part, tuple):
          msg = email.message_from_string(response_part[1])
          varSubject = msg['subject']
          varFrom = msg['from']

   #remove the brackets around the sender email address
   varFrom = varFrom.replace('&lt;', '')
   varFrom = varFrom.replace('&gt;', '')

   #add ellipsis (...) if subject length is greater than 35 characters
   if len( varSubject ) &gt; 35:
      varSubject = varSubject[0:32] + '...'

   print '[' + varFrom.split()[-1] + '] ' + varSubject
</code></pre>

<p>this gives me the most recent 15 message subject and sender address in decending order as requested! Thanks to all who helped!</p>

<p>When the cancel button is clicked, the following Javascript (with a bit of jQuery) is run:</p>

<pre><code>function undo_changes(el) {

  // Restore the previously-stored original innerHTML and event handler
  el.innerHTML = cell_contents;
  cell_contents = undefined;
  $(el).bind('click', box_click);

  // Restore the form's action and events
  $(main_form).attr('action',main_form_destination).attr('onchange', 'return true');

<p>The cancel button is implemented as follows (<code>this.parentNode</code> refers to the cell):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button onclick=""undo_changes(this.parentNode)""&gt;Cancel&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I click the cancel button, nothing appears to change. When I step through the code in the debugger, the changes happen as expected. However, upon reaching the end of the function, suddenly all the changes are reverted. What's going on?</p>

<p>I'm running Chromium under Ubuntu and jQuery 1.10.2.</p>

<h2>Further details</h2>

<p>The debugger shows the following below my function on the call stack. I don't pretend to understand it.</p>

<pre><code>(function() {with (this[2]) {with (this[1]) {with (this[0]) {return function(event) {undo_changes(this.parentNode)
};}}}})
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason, upon leaving my function, execution jumps to jQuery at line 4761. Following that, jQuery somehow calls my function <code>box_click()</code> which creates what I'm trying to delete.</p>

<h2>By request</h2>

<p>As I type this edit, the problem has been solved. Nevertheless, I was asked to show <code>box_click()</code>, which creates the editing interface. Here's the version that was current when I originally posted the question:</p>

<pre><code>function box_click() {
  if(cell_contents) {
    alert('Please deal with the other place you\'re editing first.');
    return false;
  }
  var id = this.id;
  var student_id = $(this).attr('student_id');
  var class_date = $(this).attr('date');
  var html = make_radio('attendance','None',get_current(this) == 'None');
  html += make_radio('attendance','Present',get_current(this) == 'Present');
  html += make_radio('attendance','Absent',get_current(this) == 'Absent');
  html += make_radio('attendance','Tardy',get_current(this) == 'Tardy');

<p>Atm I've cut out a great amount of the code as I've managed to find out where the error comes from; if I comment out the following parts in the code below it runs (but then of no use for me). I've tried to print out the indices used in the arrays to see if one of them turns negative, but no luck there. So I really can't find the error. Most likely something silly, but I just can't find out what the error is. I also use the same code snippet below in another function (for a LMS filter), and there it works as it should. The main difference between the two functions is the amount of temporary arrays required for processing. So the big question is: does anyone see any obvious mistake in the code which should lead to a seg. fault? (Otherwise I know that the code is probably not as good as it can, but that will come with time when I've written some more C I assume).</p>

<p>Afterwards I created a class in my DAL that you can view below:</p>

<pre><code>public class Studies

        var soap = new ListsSoapClient();

        MessageBox.Show(studyResponse.ToString());

        return TranslateResponse(studyResponse); //&lt;-- Not yet implemented
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here's my App.config:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?&gt;

  &lt;startup&gt;

<p>Now, for the actual issue. Whenever I run my application and I call the GetStudies() method I get an error saying:   </p>

<pre><code>An unhandled exception of type 'System.ServiceModel.Security.MessageSecurityException' occurred in mscorlib.dll

Additional information: The HTTP request is unauthorized with client authentication scheme 'Ntlm'. The authentication header received from the server was 'NTLM'.
</code></pre>

<p>With an InnerException that says:</p>

<pre><code>The remote server returned an error: (401) Unauthorized.
</code></pre>

<p>Now that all that has been said, I think the problem is that the request I'm sending out isn't authorized (duh). But I thought it would be.. (see code from Studies.cs). </p>

<p>So my first question is: Do I still need to authorize for the request, and if so, how do I do that?</p>

<p>If not, how would I be able to get the ListItems that I want?</p>

<p>I'm sorry for the long post but this is my first time using C# to get SharePoint data and I have no idea what data is actually important and what isn't so I just posted everything (I think). So if anyone has some feedback as to what information is obsolete and which necessary, I'm happy to edit the post.</p>

I've even gone so far as to create a stripped down version of the site which only logs in a user, pulls up their profile and then logs off.   That still fails under stress.

<p>I am new to npm and in an attempt to make a widget reusable I have made it an npm module. This widget is an AngularJS module that has 2 controllers, 2 services, and 2 directives. It also has two dependencies (AngularJS and UI.Bootstrap). The goal is to have another application (which is just an AngularJS module) consume it, this is to simulate my widget being consumed by an even larger application that uses the npm to manage its dependencies.</p>

<p>The file structure is the following for my project:</p>

<pre><code>--index.html
 --package.json
 --app
    --test.module.js
 --node_modules
    --angular
    --my-widget
        --package.json
        --node_modules
        --src
            --templates
            --my.module.js
            --myDirective1.js
            --myDirective2.js
            --...rest of controllers/services...

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is where I get confused, everywhere I look the examples are different, it seems there is no standard for my scenario, and since my-widget is just an AngularJS module with some controllers, directives, and services, I am unsure if I need an ""main"": ""index.js"" within the package.json for my-widget.</p>

<p><strong>node_modules/my-widget/index.js</strong> :</p>

<pre><code>require('angular');
require('angular-bootstrap-npm');
require('./src'); //this is to require my-widget and all its components
module.exports = 'mywidgetmodule'//this is the name of the angularjs module that 'contains' all of the controllers and directives
</code></pre>

<p>I also have some templates that my-widget depends on, they are part of the widget and are located in node_modules/mywidget/src/templates - butt I get 404 not found when I have a templateUrl of ""./templates/template1.html"" in myDirective1 - am I supposed to provide a url of ./node_modules/my-widget/src/templates instead? I am hesitant of this because in a really big application, couldn't it be configured to install the modules elsewhere?</p>

<p>Do I have to put everything into one long file and use that instead of index.js, how would I then 'export/import'? Am I doing this right by loading all these dependencies in the head of index.html, including the node_modules within each folder inside of the root node_modules folder... or is there a more elegant way to do this?</p>

<p>If anyone can shed some light into what I am doing wrong, and point me in the right direction, I would be grateful beyond words.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking time out of your day to pass by my question, and if you read it this far I appreciate it even if your solution does not solve my problem, please share your thoughts.</p>

<p>I found a strange (possibly CoreData related) problem regarding said bottom scroller. When I open the article page, I fetch the related articles, allocate a series of <code>articleViewControllers</code> and add their views to the scroll view. When I switch from the article page, I remove all the views from the scroller and release the <code>articleViewControllers</code>. Upon using Instruments and a couple of heapshots (one before tapping an article and another when switching back to the main page), I found that a substantial amount of memory remains allocated (see images)</p>

<p><code>tempArticle</code> is an instance of the <code>Article</code> class, a subclass of NSManagedObject.

<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/P8KRv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>First of all when my game start,in viewdidload i move  my red ball using NStimer from top to bottom.below when i click on my aeroplan its firs the missels using NStimer...first i check the intersection then create new balls.</p>

<pre><code>          if ((CGRectIntersectsRect(missels.frame,Ball.frame))
         {
          [self performSelector:@selector(createball) ];
          }
</code></pre>

<p>when my missels hit the ball its split into two parts as i show in screen shot.here is code for these two new balls.</p>

<pre><code> -(void)createball{
  imageMove1 = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(x,y,50 ,50)];        
  UIImage *imag = [UIImage imageNamed:@""ball1.png""];
  [imageMove1 setImage:imag];
  imageMove1.tag=i;
  [self.view addSubview:imageMove1];
  [ballArray addObject:imageMove1];

  imageMove2 = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(x,y,50 ,50)];        
  UIImage *imag1 = [UIImage imageNamed:@""ball1.png""];
  [imageMove2 setImage:imag1];
  imageMove2.tag=k;
  [self.view addSubview:imageMove2];
  [ball1Array addObject:imageMove2];
  [self performSelector:@selector(moveball) ];
 }
</code></pre>

<p>after that i give the movement to these new balls using CAKeyframeAnimation .here is code.</p>

<pre><code>-(void)moveball{

<p>My this methods only works for me to create first two balls after missels and ball intersection.once when my balls gets movement after that its not works for intersection.so in short in this games i face two main problems.</p>

<ol>
<li>How to create two new balls on every intersections of my ball and missels.</li>
<li><p>After creation of these balls how to get frames of these balls during movement for intersection with missel.just like this..</p>

<pre><code>  if ((CGRectIntersectsRect(missels.frame,mynewballs.frame))

<p>The problem is to make a temporary storage for my statistics (text features, extracted from each text). For each text I have two arrays: int[numOfFeatures] (the indexes of features presented) and double[numOfFeatures] (the weight of each feature). In case of <code>numOfFeatures == 3000</code>, it's about 36 Kb size, or 36 Gb for all the base.</p>

<p>I tried to do it with SQLite database, packing the arrays as BLOBs:</p>

<p><code>CREATE TABLE 'docBlobs' ('docId' INTEGER, 'featureIndexes' BLOB, 'featureWeights' BLOB );</code></p>

<p><code>CREATE INDEX 'docIdIndex_docBlobs' ON 'docBlobs' ('docId' ASC);</code></p>

<p>The main use case of such statistics is sequential iterative loading of BLOBs of given category. The information of what document IDs are of each category, is stored in memory, and I tried some ways of loading BLOBs by a set of known IDs.</p>

<p>First, I tried performing</p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM 'docBlobs' WHERE 'docBlobs'.'docId' = '?'</code></p>

<p>in a cycle. It gave about 20 rows per second.</p>

<p>Then, I tried to make a temp table in memory, put there the needed IDs and use it as IN list:</p>

<p><code>PRAGMA temp_storage = MEMORY</code></p>

<p><code>CREATE TEMP TABLE 'tempTable' ('docId' INTEGER)</code></p>

<p><code>INSERT INTO 'tempTable' VALUES (?)</code></p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM 'docBlobs' WHERE 'docBlobs'.'docId' IN (SELECT 'tempTable'.'docId' FROM 'tempTable')</code></p>

<p>It gave me about 20 rows per second.</p>

<p>Then I tried to make a JOIN with temp table. Is also gave me about 20 rows per second.</p>

<p>Don't you know a way to get a normal reading speed for my task?</p>

<p>P.S. In case of <code>SELECT * FROM 'docBlobs'</code> the reading speed was about 1000 rows per second, just like the speed of my HDD.</p>

<p>The case statement in the plugins class is what I'd like to be returned to the original switch statement. So in the plugin class I can add additional cases that can be included in the original switch statement.</p>

<p>Long version: In my project I have custom annotation action <code>@AuthenticationRequired</code> which loads <code>User</code> object from the database and puts it into <code>context.args</code>. It uses DAO class that implements <code>UserDAO</code>. Now I want to use DAO class injected into <code>Action</code> by Google Guice. I can use Guice and inject instances in controllers and tests, but I have difficulties injecting DAO class inside Action.</p>

<p>Injector is a field on <code>GlobalSettings</code> instance.</p>

<p>I tried to override <code>GlobalSettings#onRequest()</code> and put UserDAO instance to <code>context.args</code> and then retrieve it from inside <code>AuthenticationRequired</code> action, but it turns out that Action returned by <code>GlobalSettings#onRequest()</code> being called last in the chain of action used with @With and/or custom annotations, so, it is to late.</p>

<p>I also tried to inject DAO instance by annotating action constructor, but but it uses no-args constructor to create an instance of action.</p>

<p>Any ideas how can I achieve this?</p>

<li><p>Relaunch MATLAB using the -jdb flag from a command prompt. For example:</p>

<p>matlab -jdb</p>

<p>(by default this flag will enable debugging support in the VM on port 4444)</p></li>
<li><p>You can either launch a Java debugger from a Java IDE such as Eclipse and Intellij, or call jdb from the system command prompt. MATLAB displays the message “JVM is being started with debugging enabled” and provides the appropriate information. For example:</p>

<p>jdb -connect com.sun.jdi.SocketAttach:port=4444</p></li>
<li><p>After attaching the debugger you will be able to set breakpoints as you normally would.</p></li>

The subclass has all the methods of  rotation identified (shouldAutoRotate, supportedOrientations and preferredOrientation).</p>

<p>As part of the tabbar, I have a UINavigationController which has my viewController as the initial view on the stack hierarchy.</p>

<p>I also created a Category of UINavigationController and provided the right methods of orientation.</p>

<p>Problem in iPad only (working fine in iPhone):
The UIViewController#1 supports Landscape while UIViewController#2 supports all orientations.
When I navigate from UVC#1 to UVC#2, the UVC is able to rotate correctly in any of the orientations. However, from inside UVC#2 when I rotate from L->P and hit the back button on the nav bar, the UVC#1 is shown in portait while expected is Landscape. I have mentioned as part of UVC#1, the supported interface to be only Landscape (and the method is being called, I verified). I tried changing the values of shouldAutoRotate but no difference.</p>

<p>This works fine in iPhone, but iPad is giving trouble.</p>

<p>This currently will print the following values:</p>

<pre><code>{'q1': {'blue': 1, 'orange': 3, 'red': 2},
 'q2': {'female': 4, 'male': 2},
 'q3': {'18-25': 3, '26-30': 3}}

<p>I would like to instead pretend that I have the following demographics:</p>

<ul>
<li>50% male</li>
<li>50% female</li>
<li>40% 18-15</li>
<li>60% 26-30</li>
</ul>

<p>How would automatically generate weights for this data given what I want to represent?  For given values that don't match a demographic I'll just assume a weight of 1.</p>

<p>I'm interested in using pandas/numpy if they are helpful but will use whatever tool works best.</p>

<p>For single value weighting I would probably do it like this (I need multiple variables):</p>

<p>That is, anything that starts with <code>&lt;</code> and ends with <code>&gt;</code> is getting stripped or filtered and no longer appears in ColdFusion's <code>FORM</code> scope when it's posted.</p>

<p>Our server with BlueDragon JX does not suffer this problem.</p>

<p>If we bypass using the default <code>FORM</code> scope and use this code, the tag-like content appears:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;cfscript&gt;

    RAWREQUEST = GetHttpRequestData();
    // split the string on ""&amp;"" character, each variable should now be separate
    // note that at this point duplicate variables will get clobbered
    RAWFORMFIELDS = ListToArray(RAWREQUEST.content, ""&amp;"");
    // We're creating a structure like ""FORM"", but better
    BetterFORM = StructNew();
    // Go over each of the raw form fields, take the key
    // and add it as a key, and decode the value into the value field
    // and trap the whole thing if for some reason garbage gets in there
    for(i=1;i LTE ArrayLen(RAWFORMFIELDS);i = i + 1) {
        temp = ListToArray(RAWFORMFIELDS[i], ""="");
        try {
            tempkey = temp[1];
            tempval = URLDecode(temp[2]);                 
            StructInsert(BetterFORM, tempkey, tempval);
        } catch(Any e) {
            tempThisError = ""Malformed Data: "" &amp; RAWFORMFIELDS[i];
            // Log the value of tempThisError here?

        }
    }
&lt;/cfscript&gt;
&lt;cfdump var=""#BetterFORM#""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If we do this, and use the created <code>BetterFORM</code> variable, it's there, so it does not seem to be a problem with the requests being filtered at some other point in the stack. I was thinking maybe it was URLScan, but that appears not to be installed. Since BD.NET runs on .NET as the engine, perhaps there's some sanitization setting that is being used on all variables somehow?</p>

<p>Let's say I have a PHP website which has an API (SOAP, REST, etc.) and this API serves almost the same things that are available through the pages (<em>e.g.</em> blog post, comments, statistics, etc.).</p>

<p>In order to avoid code redundancy/duplication I'm thinking of using the API even for the site itself because, although most of code factorization is already done by using MVC's Model, some logic is still in double if a site has to offer an API.</p>

<h2>Example when a visitor retrieves a given blog's post:</h2>

<h3>Classic GUI:</h3>

<ol>
<li>HTTP request: sent by browser</li>
<li>PHP Controller: read user input</li>
<li>PHP Model: fetch the post from database</li>
<li>PHP Controller: populate the view</li>
<li>PHP View: render HTML</li>
<li>HTTP response: sent to browser</li>
</ol>

<h3>GUI using API:</h3>

<ol>
<li>HTTP request: sent by browser</li>
<li>PHP ""posts"" Controller: read user input</li>
<li>HTTP API request: sent by PHP Controller to site's API URL</li>
<li>PHP ""api"" Controller: read API request</li>
<li>PHP Model: fetch the post from database</li>
<li>PHP ""api"" Controller: populate the ""api"" view</li>
<li>PHP ""api"" View: render (XML, JSON, etc.)</li>
<li>HTTP API response: sent to PHP Controller of point 2.</li>
<li>PHP Controller: populate the view</li>
<li>PHP View: render HTML</li>
<li>HTTP response: sent to browser</li>
</ol>

<p>My opinion is that GUI <strong>should</strong> be a layer that consumes API (a new layer) but I am concerned about performances issues because, in PHP websites, an API call goes through an HTTP request which takes time.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that I copied this code, almost verbatim (changed the form names and fields, obviously) from another page that has basically the same functionality and works 100%. Code below: </p>

<p>This is the page containing the form where the transaction is being submitted:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$script = '&lt;script&gt; 
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("".datepicker"").datepicker();

                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;?php   };?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the query itself, aka ""transadded.php"":</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$title = ""Project Added - "";
include('inc/header.php');
$query = ""INSERT INTO newtransaction (moveid, inout, units, transdate, refno) VALUES('$_POST[moveID]','$_POST[inorout]','$_POST[numberofunits]','$_POST[dateoftransaction]','$_POST[rrdt]')"";

if(!mysqli_query($con,$query))
{
die ('Error: ' . mysqli_error($con));
}
echo '&lt;div class=""transstatus""&gt;' . '1 record added' . '&lt;/div&gt;';

mysqli_close($con);
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The header, obviously, contains the function for connecting to the database, and as I said, another query works just fine with it, so I know that that isn't the problem. Upon clicking the submit button, the error I get on the page is as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'inout, units, transdate, refno) VALUES ('1234567','Storage In','81','09/11/2013'' at line 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, ""1234567"", ""Storage In"", etc are the values I enter into the form. </p>

<p>I hope you can help me out. I'm so stuck!</p>

<p>Also, I know that I'm not protected against injection right now. I plan to work on that later, but I'm trying to get the functionality straightened out first. </p>

I'm trying to externalize my properties file, currently placed in my user home. I'm loading the properties file using <code>@PropertySource</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Configuration
@PropertySources(value = { @PropertySource(""file:#{systemProperties['user.home']}/.invoice/config.properties"") })
public class PropertiesConfig {

    @Bean
    public static PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer propertiesPlaceHolderConfigurer() {
        return new PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But unfortunately, that is not loading the properties file. Throws <code>FileNotFoundException</code>. But if I change the path to:</p>

<pre><code>@PropertySources(value = { @PropertySource(""file:/home/rohit/.invoice/config.properties"") })
</code></pre>

<p>it works properly. And that is the path which the earlier path resolves to. I've logged it to verify. So it seems to me that SpEL is not getting evaluated in the <code>@PropertySource</code> annotation. Is it supposed to work that way?</p>

<p>If yes, then is there any other way to read the external properties file, which sits in <code>/home/rohit</code>? I don't want to give absolute path, for obvious reasons. And I would like to avoid extending <code>PropertyPlaceHolderConfigurer</code> class.</p>

<p>One other option I tried was adding the <code>/home/rohit/.invoice</code> folder to tomcat classpath. But seems like Spring doesn't use System Classpath to resolve <code>classpath:</code> suffix. Any pointers on this?</p>

<p>I am using Storyboards, with my first view controller defined as <code>LogbookFirstViewController</code>.</p>

<p>The contents of this controller are inside of a <code>UIControl</code>. That way I can detect taps. </p>

<p>However, I can see no easy way to determine when a user has started swiping across the screen. All I want to do is get the touches x-coordinate. Essentially track it.</p>

<p>I dropped a <code>UIPanGestureRecognizer</code> inside <code>LogbookFirstViewController</code>, and attached it's outlet too:</p>

<p>In <code>.h</code></p>

<pre><code>@property (assign) IBOutlet UIGestureRecognizer *gestureRecognizer;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, I then synthesized it and set the delegate:</p>

<p>In <code>.m</code></p>

<pre><code>[gestureRecognizer setDelegate:self];

-(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event
{

    UITouch *touchLoc = [touches anyObject];
    CGPoint beginCenter = self.view.center;
    CGPoint touchPoint = [touchLoc locationInView:self.view];

    deltaX = touchPoint.x - beginCenter.x;
    deltaY = touchPoint.y - beginCenter.y;
    NSLog(@""X = %f &amp; Y = %f"", deltaX, deltaY);
}

- (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event {
    UITouch * touch = [touches anyObject];
    CGPoint touchPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view];

    // Set the correct center when touched
    touchPoint.x -= deltaX;
    touchPoint.y -= deltaY;

    self.view.center = touchPoint;

I don't even know where to begin, so I guess I'll just dump all the related code. If I put breakpoints pretty much everywhere in the code below, the following two things get called at startup (in this order):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>StubContentProvider.OnCreate()</code> </li>
<li><code>AndroidApp.InitSyncService()</code> (called explicitly when my app starts up).</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's it. Nothing else related to the <code>SyncAdapter</code> ever gets called (Seriously, I've put breakpoints at the top of every method of every class related to it.)</p>

<p>I've worked on this aspect of the app off and on for about a month and a half and at various times had it more functional than it is now, but I'm not sure how I made it less functional. I've tried tweaking every aspect of it. I've changed <code>ACCOUNT_TYPE</code> and <code>AUTHORITY</code> to various values. As I've read documentation and learned more, I'll tweak here and there, but it just doesn't seem to want to come together for me. </p>

"10600698","1","","","2012-05-15 12:30:51","","1","12696","<p>I am implementing an Entity Attribute Value based persistence mechanism. All DB access is done via Hibernate. 
I have a table that contains paths for nodes, it is extremely simple, just an  id, and a path (string) The paths would be small in number, around a few thousand.</p>

<p>The main table has millions of rows, and rather than repeating the paths, I've normalized the paths to their own table. The following is the behaviour I want, when inserting into main table</p>

<p>1) Check if the path exists in paths table (query via entity manager, using path value as parameter)</p>

<p>2) if it does not exist, insert, and get id (persist via entity manager)</p>

<p>3) put id as foreign key value to main table row, and insert this into main table. </p>

<p>This is going to happen thousands of times for a set of domain objects, which correspond to lots of rows in main table and some other tables. So the steps above are repeated using a single transaction like this:</p>

<pre><code>    EntityTransaction t = entityManager.getTransaction();
    t.begin();
    //perform steps given above, check, and then persist etc..
    t.commit();
</code></pre>

<p>When I perform step 2, it introduces a huge performance drop to the total operation. It is begging for caching, because after a while that table will be at most 10-20k entries with very rare new inserts. I've tried to do this with Hibernate, and lost almost 2 days. </p>

<p>I'm using Hibernate 4.1, with JPA annotations and ECache. I've tried to enable query caching, even using the same query object throughout the inserts, as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>Query call = entityManager.createQuery(""select pt from NodePath pt "" +
                ""where pt.path = :pathStr)"");
        call.setHint(""org.hibernate.cacheable"", true);  
        call.setParameter(""pathStr"", pPath);
        List&lt;NodePath&gt; paths = call.getResultList();
        if(paths.size() &gt; 1)
            throw new Exception(""path table should have unique paths"");
        else if (paths.size() == 1){
            NodePath path = paths.get(0);
            return path.getId();
        }
        else {//paths null or has zero size
            NodePath newPath = new NodePath();
            newPath.setPath(pPath);
            entityManager.persist(newPath);
            return newPath.getId();
        }
</code></pre>

<p>The NodePath entity is annotated as follows:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Cacheable
@Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)
@Table(name = ""node_path"", schema = ""public"")
public class NodePath implements java.io.Serializable {
</code></pre>

<p>The query cache is being used, as far as I can see from the statistics, but no use for second level cache is reported:</p>

<pre><code>queries executed to database=1
query cache puts=1
query cache hits=689
query cache misses=1
....
second level cache puts=0
second level cache hits=0
second level cache misses=0
entities loaded=1
....
</code></pre>

<p>A simple, hand written hashtable as a cache, works as expected, cutting down total time drastically. I guess I'm failing to trigger Hibernate's caching due to nature of my operations. </p>

<p><strong>How do I use hibernate's second level cache with this setup?</strong> For the record, this is my persistence xml:</p>

<p>http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_0.xsd""

        &lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>my goal is to extract various data points from these chunks of xml that i get out of the master XML file by using a </p>

<pre><code>.SelectNodes(""//div/span['pp-headline-item pp-headline-phone']/../.."")
</code></pre>

<p>with this i am expecting to get all the sections outlined above so i can iterate them and extract things like website, phone, address...</p>

<p>problem is when i iterate this nodeset i cant get to the data points i want as if the node set is not the one outlined on top.</p>

<p>my logic is to extract a nodeset from the top most div into the nodset and when iterating them to xpath into the data points i want.</p>

<p>i do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (HtmlNode n in BuizRowsgoogMaps)
                {                    
                    //get phone number
                    if (n.SelectSingleNode(""span/nobr"").InnerHtml != null)
                    {
                        strPhone = n.SelectSingleNode(""span/nobr"").InnerHtml;

                        //get phone site
                        strSite = n.SelectSingleNode(""//span['pp-headline-item pp-headline-authority-page']/span/a/span"").InnerHtml;
                     }
                }
</code></pre>

<p>i suspect my xpaths dont mesh together to get what i want but when i validate my expression i get the desired results... i used this to validate my thinking and it works leaving me at wits end:</p>

<pre><code>//div/span['pp-headline-item pp-headline-phone']/../../span['pp-headline-item pp-headline-phone']/span/nobr

<blockquote>
  <p>SetUp</p>
  
  <p>TestSuite</p>
  
  <p>content.txt + properties.xml (just ""!contents"" inside)</p>

        <p>PositiveTest</p>
        
        <p>content.txt + properties.xml (just ""!contents"" inside)</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>OneAdultWithChild</p>
          
          <p>here content.txt + properties.xml for the actual test containing 18 fixture    tables</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>When we start fitnesse and navigate to the deepest folder (""OneAdultWithChild"") it takes roundabout 10 seconds until the page is displayed. Now, when I move the content up one hierarchy level (into ""PositiveTest"") the page takes 3 seconds to render. When I put the test content on the second level (""UseCase2204"") it almost displays in a instant.</p>

<p>The same behaviour happens during test executing. After pressing the ""test"" button the tests take:</p>

<ul>
<li>second level: 12 seconds</li>
<li>fourth level: 14 seconds</li>
<li>fifth level:  40 seconds! (plus, it takes ages until the ""result captured"" button appears)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I am stuck with this. We need this deeply nested structure to group all the tests. But if there is no solution or workaround we can't use fitnesse and i will be a big idiot for promoting the framework. In the past I've had positive results with fitnesse but we didn't have these deeply nested structures.</p>

<p>Edited: As Frank Conijn mentions it is not really working with Safari. I now solved it with Javascript (Check all number input fields if they contain a number and if it is within the specified bounds):        </p>

<pre><code>$(""input[type='number']"").change(function(){
    var maxValue = parseInt($(this).attr('max'));
    var minValue = parseInt($(this).attr('min'));
    var enteredValue = parseInt($(this).val());

    if($.isNumeric(enteredValue)) {
        var enteredValue = parseInt($(this).val());
        if (enteredValue &gt; maxValue) {
            $(this).val(maxValue);
        } else if (enteredValue &lt; minValue) {
            $(this).val(minValue);
        }
    } else {
        $(this).val(minValue);
    }


});

}
public String getSelectedCopyValue() {

<p>What I'm trying to do is when the user clicks on a number on the drop down list, it will change the selectedCopyValue to the number they click. Then I want the drop down list to pull the selectedCopyValue and set the number they just selected as it's default. This way, if the user selectes 4 copies then presses add the GUI will be refreshed and when it comes back the list can repopulate with its showing/default value now set to 4 instead of 1 so the user will not have to re-select 4 another time.</p>

<p>I need a simple way to manage my 433mhz devices with my raspberry pi 2 in order to <strong>send</strong> or <strong>receive</strong> codes through 433mhz radio waves.</p>

<h1>My issue</h1>

<p><em>No error</em> in the console, but <em>code is not sent</em></p>

<h1>What i've done</h1>

<p>I've made an NodeJS(0.12.x) Addon that wrap the <a href=""https://github.com/ninjablocks/433Utils/tree/master/RPi_utils"" rel=""nofollow"">RCSwitch class</a> with two simples methods : <strong>send(code)</strong> and a <strong>receive(Function(code))</strong></p>

<p>My addon code is inspired by this one <a href=""https://github.com/marvinroger/node-rcswitch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/marvinroger/node-rcswitch</a> (i only tried with <strong>codeSend</strong>) :</p>

<h1>The code</h1>

<p><strong>rfnode.cpp</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include ""RCSwitch.h""
#include &lt;node.h&gt;
#include &lt;v8.h&gt;

using namespace v8;

void CodeSend(const v8::FunctionCallbackInfo&lt;v8::Value&gt;&amp; args) {

  Isolate* isolate = Isolate::GetCurrent();
  HandleScope scope(isolate);

  int PIN = 0;
  RCSwitch mySwitch = RCSwitch();
  mySwitch.enableTransmit(PIN);
  mySwitch.send(args[0]-&gt;IntegerValue(), 24);

  args.GetReturnValue().Set(String::NewFromUtf8(isolate, ""ok""));

}

void init(Handle&lt;Object&gt; exports) {

  NODE_SET_METHOD(exports, ""Send"", CodeSend);

}

NODE_MODULE(rfnode, init)
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I need a <code>binding.gyp</code> file to build my Addon : <code>node-gyp configure build</code> (with the flag : <code>-lwiringPi</code>)</p>

<p><strong>binding.gyp</strong></p>

<pre><code>{
  ""targets"": [
    {      
      'target_name': 'rfnode',
      'sources': [ 'src/rfnode.cc', 'src/RCSwitch.cpp' ],
      'include_dirs': [ '/usr/local/include' ],
      'ldflags': [ '-lwiringPi' ]
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>And, i test my node addon with this file :</p>

<p><strong>index.js</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var rfnode = require('./build/Release/rfnode');
console.log(rfnode.Send(5204));
</code></pre>

<p>When i execute it with <strong>sudo node index.js</strong> i get no error but the code is not sent. Any help is appreciate !!</p>

One of the classes uses a jax.xml.datatype.Duration.  Here is the Java code where I create a bean with test data using the duration:</p>

<pre><code>DatatypeFactory df = DatatypeFactory.newInstance();
Duration duration = df.newDuration(RANDOM.nextLong());
testObject.setDuration(duration);
</code></pre>

<p>DWR doesn't like that duration in the object:</p>

<p>ERROR [org.directwebremoting.dwrp.DefaultConverterManager] - No converter found for 'com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.jaxp.datatype.DurationImpl'</p>

<p>and occasionally I see the same message (I think it was when I was going from JavaScript back to Java) for the class com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.jaxp.datatype.DurationImpl</p>

<p>Defining a regular converter doesn't help:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dwr:convert type=""bean"" match=""com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.jaxp.datatype.DurationImpl""/&gt;
&lt;dwr:convert type=""bean"" match=""javax.xml.datatype.Duration""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm sure the above doesn't work because they're not really beans.  But I'm at a loss as to how to get it to work.  I've read in several places that you can define a custom converter, but the details seem very vague and in most cases out dated.  The DWR website says there's a link that explains it all, but it just links you to the javadoc which doesn't help me with the actual implementation. </p>

<p>Can anybody help me figure out how to handle a duration?</p>

I have 2 buttons 1 for setting depart date and the other for setting the return date. clicking on the depart button pops one datepicker dialog and clicking on the return button pops out second datepicker dialog. In the depart date picker dialog, I need to disable the dates when the user tries to select a date which is less than todays date. In the return date picker dialog, there two conditons has to be checked. First one, if a user has not selected a depart date from depart date picker dialog, the return date picker dialog should show the date as current date in it. And when a user tries to select a date which is less than todays date, I need to disable the user from doing so. Secondly, if a user has set the depart date using the depart date picker dialog, then the return date picker dialog,should show the date same as the depart date. And when the user tries to select a date below the depart date, he should be tried to stop it. I have implemented all these successfully in my app for ginger bread and below versions. But the problem is that, when I try to implement this from versions above honeycomb, the app is force closing. How can I set the minimum date in the date picker dialog for versions above honeycomb. Also my app is made to work over all versions from froyo to kitkat and so I have set the min sdk version as that of froyo.

I was able to create the layout of my program and can load in the png files in a specific place within the window and I have place the map where I want in the window to.
I found some approach to dragging images and it was ok but it broke and was not efficient. 
I came across the ""dragging objects in processing"" question on this website(found here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15305722/dragging-objects-in-processing"">dragging objects in processing</a>). Mike 'Pomax' Kamermans' code is really efficient and I was able to incorporate my current code with his so that I almost have what I want. The issue is that I am dragging stings. I have tried to adapt the code so that I can load in and drag images instead but it is beyond my level of knowledge. I do think that his approach to redrawing is the way to go.

Image quality is really WORSE there, so I've started researching this issue, created simple application which shows the image using 2D graphics on the top part of the window, and the same image on the bottom part using 3D graphics. I noticed that image looks much worse on 3D surface than on 2D. The colors on the 3D surface are less saturated and do not have clear boundaries.  Note, that I applied <strong>linear bitmap scaling</strong> mode to the root Grid. Other weird thing is that when I'm changing bitmap scaling mode to 'Fant' or 'NearestNeighbor' it affects 2D graphics, but image on the 3D surface REMAINS THE SAME! I'm using image for this sample with Height = 466px, Width = 490px. I'm zooming out it in the code (both 2D and 3D implementation) a little bit to see the scaling quality degradation.

    myClass mc;
    mc.funcA();
    mc.printStr();

    cin &gt;&gt; done;

<p>The reason my original code didn't work was because I had split the declaration and implementation of funcB into two parts (.h &amp; .cpp), and in the .h I did this</p>

<pre><code>void funcB(std::function&lt;void (myClass*)&gt; otherFunc = NULL)

Is it something that my application should handle or android system will scale the image as per my screen configuration. My image on the server never changes and is of the fixed size and I have allocated some space on the screen of my application to display it.</p>

<pre><code>NSURL *theURL = (NSURL *)[info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerReferenceURL];

<p>I have tried to implement hiding of fields and labels, and at the moment it seems like a very cumbersome process (I am not sure if it can be improved). Example of how I do it is in code below...</p>

<p>As you can see it can get pretty messy. What I am doing there is first generate a boolean control array, and using that array I first hide specified fields and then move everything up to remove empty spaces. I am trying to find a better way to do this.</p>

<p>I also looking for someways to possibly have control on arrangement of those GUI elements. Let's say I want to have LastName filed come up first, not FirstName field. How could I do it without having to rewrite the code in this form?</p>

<pre><code>// Generate boolean array to control visible status of each field
bool[] hideControl = new bool[13];
for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 12; i++)
{
   hideControl[i] = Convert.ToBoolean(MobileConfiguration.Settings[i]);
}
// Difference in pixels between two input panels
int diff = this.txtLastName.Location.Y - this.txtFirstName.Location.Y;
// Hide Fields
hideFields(hideControl);

// Movie Fields
moveFields(hideControl, diff);
..................
// hideFields function
if (hideValue[0] == true)
{
    // Hide Install
    this.txtFirstName.Visible = false;
    this.lblFirstName.Visible = false;
}
// And so forth for each 12 fields
...................
// moveFields function
if (hideValue[0] == true)
{
    // LastName -- 2nd field
       this.txtLastName.Location = new Point(this.txtLastName.Location.X, (this.txtLastName.Location.Y - diff));
    this.lblLastName.Location = new Point(this.lblLastName.Location.X, (this.lblLastName.Location.Y - diff));
    // So forth for 11 fields
}
if (hideValue[1] == true)
{
    // Move up other 10 fields
}
if (hideValue[2] == true)
{
    // Move up other 9 fields
}

I am using Entity Framework (3.5) and returning a bunch of custom POCO objects to the client. The service needs to be alive as it provides cross-client communication and hence Duplex binding is used. I would like dispose all the POCO objects created once they are serialized to the client. 
As the session and hence the service is still alive, it looks like Framework is not doing any Garbage collection on these objects and over time the service is crashing with ""Insufficient Memory"" like error (after about 2GB).</p>

<p>I don't think dispose can be called before return statement, as the objects are not yet serialized by then.</p>

<p>Please suggest a solution.</p>

I registered my app with instagram and have everything working so far. When the user clicks the ADD ACCOUNT button, I load the instagram auth url (<a href=""https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=CLIENT-ID&amp;redirect_uri=REDIRECT-URI&amp;response_type=token"" rel=""nofollow"">https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=CLIENT-ID&amp;redirect_uri=REDIRECT-URI&amp;response_type=token</a>) into a webview and the instagram login page appears. </p>

<p>I can then successfully login, my redirect then redirects correctly, and I can then exchange the code for an access token, close the webview, and display an alert saying that login was successful. But when the user clicks the ADD ACCOUNT button again and the webview loads the auth url, instead of seeing the instagram login page, it automatically authorizes and the successful login alert appears.</p>

<p>Is the webview caching something? How would I prevent this?</p>

<p>The fontsize and fontstyle properties are bound to a special user settings class that implements iNotifyPropertyChanged, which allows changes to font size and fontfamily to immediately propogate throughout my application.</p>

<p>However, in a UserControl I've created (Ironically, the screen that allows the user to customize their font settings), I want the font size and fontfamily to remain static.  No matter what I try, my global font settings override what I set in my user control:</p>

<p>I've tried setting Style to {x:Null}, setting custom font sizes inline, and setting a style in the resources of this control.   None take precedence over the styles in my resource dictionary.</p>

When I install the application onto my phone, it downloads the file correctly and loads the information, no exceptions thrown or anything.</p>

<p>However, when I upload the apk into the Android Market Place and download it onto the phone, the application downloads the database and then crashes, saying that the sqlite handler was not able to open up the database.</p>

<p>Here's the progression of code:</p>

<p>In the SQLiteOpenHelper:</p>

<pre><code>this.FULL_DB_PATH = new String(this.getWritableDatabase().getPath());
this.getWritableDatabase();

// Code for retrieving the database off of the server:

private void copyDataBase(){
        InputStream myInput=null;

        try{
            // opening connections
            URL url = new URL(""server_url_here"");
            URLConnection ucon=url.openConnection();
            myInput = ucon.getInputStream();     
            myOutput = new FileOutputStream(this.FULL_DB_PATH);

            // write to the db here
            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024*1024];
            int length;
            while ((length = myInput.read(buffer))&gt;0){
                myOutput.write(buffer, 0, length);
            }

            myOutput.flush();
            myOutput.close();
            myInput.close();
        }
         catch(Exception e)
         {

                try{
                    myOutput.flush();
                    myOutput.close();
                    myInput.close();
                }
                catch(Exception es){}
         }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know why my colleague is saving the db with a mp3 extension but...it works when we're installing the apk ad-hoc.</p>

<p>For:</p>

<pre><code>myOutput = new FileOutputStream(this.FULL_DB_PATH);
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried:</p>

<pre><code>myOutput = this.getApplicationContext().openFileOutput(this.FULL_DB_PATH, Context.MODE_WORLD_READABLE);
</code></pre>

<p>But that doesn't work either.</p>

<p>I know that it's saying AESObfuscator is being added twice, but I'm not sure of all the various places that it is being pulled in to my project. Other posts referencing this problem resulted in people providing many different possible solutions. I'm hoping someone can tell me definitively what to remove.</p>

<p>LVL's jar file is listed under ""Reference Libraries."" I manually copied the jar file to the libs folder to resolve other errors I encountered. Right-clicking my project and selecting ""Properties"" -> ""Java Build Path"" -> ""Libraries"" has the LVL jar file, Android 2.2, and com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.LIBRARIES. Initially ""Libraries"" had Android 2.2 and ""Reference Libraries"" but I manually removed reference libraries at someone else's suggestion, but this caused errors in Eclipse. I then manually added the LVL jar back in ""Libraries"" by selecting ""Add external JAR"" and the result was the 3 items above.</p>

<p>What do I need to do to resolve this? Thanks.</p>

<p>I don't want to show html tags. </p>

<p>This is my code to show detail page:</p>

<pre><code>private void detailScreen(News news){
    Form form = new Form(news.getTitle());

    StringItem detail = new StringItem("""", news.getBody().toString());
    mBackCommand = new Command(""Back"", Command.BACK, 0);

    form.append(detail);
    form.addCommand(mBackCommand);
    form.setCommandListener(this);

    //Canvas c = new MyCanvas(this, news);

    mDisplay.setCurrent(form);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Please can someone tell me what's I'm doing wrong here?</p>

"14341982","1","","","2013-01-15 16:15:26","","0","169","<p>I am quite new to Android and Java. Basically, I would like to realize an encapsulation of a background thread of Android, and inside this background thread, I have an infinite loop which will periodically take some operations of getting data(like from Internet, or from some hardware devices). </p>

<p>The encapsulated class must provide only a function like <code>getData()</code> for others to get data. But everytime when i call this <code>getData()</code> function from other classes, it never gives me the changing values, but only the initialized values.
I've studied both of the <code>AsyncTask</code>, <code>Handler</code> and <code>Message</code> ways to realize multithread. And both of them give me the initialized values.</p>

<p>Here is the encapsulated class of Handler and Message:</p>

<pre><code>public class getDataFromUSB{

private int usb_data;

private Handler handler = new Handler(){
    @Override
    public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
        super.handleMessage(msg);
        if(msg.what==1){

            usb_data=msg.arg1;


        }
    }
};

private Thread thread = new Thread(){
    @Override
    public void run(){
        while(!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted())
        {
                            int a=read_usb();
            Message msg = new Message();
            msg.arg1 = a;
            msg.what = 1;
            handler.sendMessage(msg);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(15);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.err.println("""");
                this.interrupt();
            }
        }
    }
};
public void start(){
    thread.start();

}
public int get_data(){
    return usb_data;
}
public int read_usb()
{ 
    int a=10;
    return a;
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>And then in another class, here is the code of calling <code>getDataFromUSB</code>:</p>

<pre><code>getDataFromUSB usb1= new getDataFromUSB();
usb1.start();
int a=usb1.getData();
Log.e(TAG,""a = "" +a);
</code></pre>

<p>Then everytime i call this <code>usb1.getData()</code>, the value is always 0. I don't understand why.</p>

<p>Now I proceed to do some more realistic things. I add an object of random in my getDataFrom USB class to provide different numbers, I also change the way of assigning values to usb_data, I think it's better to do it just in the background thread, there is no need to move it to the handlemessage. So it becomes:</p>

<pre><code>public class getDataFromUSB{

private int usb_data;
    private Random random = new Random(555L);

private Handler handler = new Handler(){
    @Override
    public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
        super.handleMessage(msg);

    }
};

private Thread thread = new Thread(){
    @Override
    public void run(){
        while(!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted())
        {
            int a=read_usb();
            usb_data=a;
            Message msg = new Message();
            handler.sendMessage(msg);
        }
    }
};
public void start(){
    thread.start();

}
public int get_data(){
    return usb_data;
}
public int read_usb()
{ 
    return random.nextInt();
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I call it from another class like what Nikita suggested:</p>

<pre><code>    Handler h = new Handler();   
    for (int i=0;i&lt;20;i++){
    h.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            int data=usb1.get_data();
            Log.e(TAG,""data= "" +data);  
            }
        },500); 
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The strange thing is that it then gives sometimes all the same numbers, sometimes several some numbers, sometimes all different numbers. As I understand, the usb_data has always been changed inside the background thread, so we are not obliged to wait for handlemessage to proceed. Everytime I call getData(), it should give me the newest value. Isn't that right?</p>

<p>When I run this each row from eurusd_m1 is copied to a new row in obsh4 (rather than all three rows being collapsed into a single row with each loop iteration)</p>

<p>I tried to use UPDATE for adding the second and third row of data using the following script however I get a syntax issue on FROM and I'm not sure how to remedy that either :/</p>

<pre><code>update obsh4
set  Open2 = open,
     High2 = high,
     Low2 = low,

</ol>

<p>I can see three options: </p>

<p>1) the update statement needs to be remedied</p>

<p>2) there needs to be row specification added to the insertion of the second/third rows</p>

<p>3) binning and generating something from scratch.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on either of these would be most welcome.
Thank you</p>

<p>Edit: the loop itself operates correctly and has been tested independently of the current problem.</p>

<p>So, my question: is there a real possibility that an attacker can decode the data written without encryption using NSKeyedArchiver, and understand the key-value pairs? And also modify the score data, reconnect to the network and waiting for automatic Leaderboard update from ABGameKitHelper? Or is useless to encrypt data?</p>

I have searched for that and I found out the I need to add some libraries in order to able to use action bar for android 2.X.

<p>I should get three folders samples, library, and website. But I didn't get them. </p>

<p>So I couldn't follow the rest of the tutorial. Here is the list of the files and folders I have got after extracting the folder : </p>

<p>I then tried to call this via Jquery in phonegap and it failed:
here is my jquery in phonegap using Eclipse:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

I tried wrapping my javascript with console.log(javascript above) and I could not get that to work. As you can see above I just used the alert function to output the failed error message. Any ideas? I think i may try using a try catch and then seeing if I can output the exception...</p>

<p>The first request works well (see Webrick console below)</p>

<pre><code>Started POST ""/redmine/uploads.json?attachment_id=1&amp;filename=testFile.txt"" for &lt;server_IP_address&gt; at 2014-04-04 11:37:58 +0200

Parameters: {""attachment_id""=&gt;""1"", ""filename""=&gt;""testFile.txt""}

Rendered attachments/upload.api.rsb (1.2ms) 
Completed 201 Created in 661.6ms (Views: 82.6ms | ActiveRecord: 15.6ms)
</code></pre>

<p>Then the second request is executed:</p>

<pre><code>Started POST ""/redmine/documents/150/add_attachment.xml"" for &lt;server_IP_address&gt; at 2014-04-04 11:37:59 +0200

Current user: anonymous 
Filter chain halted as :authorize rendered or redirected 
Completed 401 Unauthorized in 132.6ms (ActiveRecord: 3.0ms)
</code></pre>

<p>I get this error because the Current user here is <code>anonymous</code> (I think), I don't understand why, if I print a <code>User.current</code> after the first request the user is still logged.</p>

<p>I created the first request using the <code>net/http</code> library ant the second using <code>RestClient</code>, here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>uri = URI.parse(""http://&lt;server_IP_address&gt;/redmine/uploads.json"")

http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
file = File.new(""/home/testFile.txt"") 
@csrfToken = session[:_csrf_token]
@apiKey = User.current.api_key

@request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri.path+""?attachment_id=1&amp;filename=testFile.txt"", initheader = {'Content-Type' =&gt; ""application/octet-stream"", 'X-CSRF-Token' =&gt; @csrfToken, 'X-Redmine-API-Key' =&gt; @apiKey})
@request.body = @file.read
@response = http.request(@request)

@upToken = ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(@response.body)['upload']['token']

@secondResponse = RestClient.post 'http://&lt;server_IP_address&gt;/redmine/documents/150/add_attachment.xml', {:multipart =&gt; true, :utf8 =&gt; ""\u2713"", :authenticity_token =&gt; @csrfToken, :attachments =&gt; { ""1"" =&gt; {:filename =&gt; ""testFile.txt"", :description =&gt; ""Dropbox blabla"", :token =&gt; @upToken}}, :commit =&gt; ""Add""}, 'X-Redmine-API-Key' =&gt; @apiKey, 'X-CSRF-Token' =&gt; @csrfToken, 'Cookie' =&gt; cookies[:_redmine_session]
</code></pre>

<p>As you see I tried to set the <code>Cookie</code> header with the data of my session but it doesn't work.</p>

<p>I tried to write the second request with the same library as the first one but I get the same error. Do you know why my user is not recognized? How can I change that? </p>

<p>There isn't a plugin with user upload function in face-to-face sessions, nor there is something similar. 
Where to place the right code lines (in the different files of the plugin), or better said, which is the right way to proceed?
I would preffer to make a custom plugin, if that is easier,just need a guidence for the structure of it. The functionality is still similar to face-to-face, the sessions atendees are just uploaded. </p>

The Service layer accesses the Database using repositories accessed via the UnitOfWork pattern.</p>

<p>I just installed StructureMap to take care of injecting my Services into the MVC3 project.  An Example controller would look like this</p>

<pre><code>public class AccountManagementController : Controller
{

    public AccountManagementController(IAccountService accountService)
    {
        this.accountService = accountService;
    }

<p>Now, my problem is that my AccountService class needs to have the UnitOfWork injected when structure map creates it.  Currently I handle this by having 2 controllers.  One takes an interface, the other instantiates a concrete class.</p>

<pre><code>public class AccountService : IAccountService, IDisposable
{
    private IUnitOfWork unitOfWork;

    internal AccountService(IUnitOfWork unitOfWork)

    this.name = name;
    this.marks = marks;
    this.contacts = {};

<p><strong>1. How is this possible such that, I can preserve a copy of an object with the initial values, inside that object when its created?</strong></p>

<p>Is it possible to enable copy/past feature at any time? </p>

Often times the data come back will nil or empty fields for some users. As a result each service consumer needs to code to check each Parameter for nil. I'm looking for some strategies to tackling this at a global app level instead of by each service consumer. Some strategies / architectures consist of the services layer always mapping to a model similar to POJO's where the service is parsed and then populated into a global model object which consists of getters and setters. The getters have code in it to return """" if the value is nil. Therefore the consumer will never get a nil value passed to it. This makes it easier to handle however still has limitations.</p>

To create, read back, remove links to directories (as of now) in win32 platform.<br>
The approach that am following in my python code is, in order<br>
        a. Tries to create real symlink, if supported (via mklink cmd)<br>
        b. If unsupported, falls back to creating junction pt, if it's supported(via linkd cmd)<br>
Reading and removal follows same approach. </p>

<p>Problem:<br>
Creation and removal of both symlink and junc pt is straightforward, but i couldn't figure out how to read the target i.e. pointing directory.</p>

<p>Progress:<br>
a. For junction points, i can use 'linkd ' and parse the stdout in an ugly manner to get target dir.<br>
b. For symlink there seem to be no such solution.<br>
c. I see that there is native support in python 3.1.1[1] for win32 symlinks but am using v2.7.1 and can't upgrade now.
d. There is method in pywin32 module to create symlink but nothing i could see to read it back</p>

<p>It works great and is super efficient... but it's a mess. It's not terribly readable, so it's difficult to discern what's going.</p>

<p>The operation in pseudo code goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Loop through every article in a list called articles<code>(List&lt;Article&gt;)</code></li>
<li>For every article, loop through every role in a list of roles <code>(List&lt;string&gt;)</code></li>
<li>Check to see if the current article has any roles <code>(Article.Roles = List&lt;string&gt;)</code></li>
<li>If yes, then loop through each role in the article and try to match a role in the article to the role in the current loop</li>
<li>If a match is found, add weight to the article. If the index of the role on the article and the role in the roles list are both index 0 (in primary position) add extra weight for two matching primaries</li>
<li>Repeat for topics, but with no bonus for primary matches</li>
</ul>

I have implemented the various NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate methods (e.g. <code>controllerWillChangeContent</code>, <code>controller:didChangeObject:atIndexPath:forChangeType:newIndexPath</code>, etc.) with code from this site: <a href=""http://www.raywenderlich.com/999/core-data-tutorial-how-to-use-nsfetchedresultscontroller"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raywenderlich.com/999/core-data-tutorial-how-to-use-nsfetchedresultscontroller</a></p>

<p>The problem is a row is never inserted in the UITableView when an object matching the predicate is inserted. However, when I do delete an object that is already presented in the table view, its corresponding row disappears correctly.</p>

<p>The below is the code for instantiating the NSFetchedResultsController:</p>

    multiTable();

<p>I also want to mention that instead of the function call, had I just included all of the code contained within the function body in main, I don't get the run-time error. Why is it that when it's contained within a function, I get the runtime error, but when it's just in main, I don't get the error? And of course, what would I have to change in order for the function call to not produce the error?</p>

<p>I am creating a UI in VB2010 to a SQL Server database that will allow users to edit tables in the database.

<p>Then I use the AddHandler function to run the click event sub. That works fine, but what I need to do is grab the actual text of the submenu item (""VehicleList"", ""Maintenance"", etc.) to use in the SQL SELECT string to open the selected table in the database, like so:</p>

<p>I've scoured the internet looking for this, but if it's there, I can't find it. Tried many ways, but I either get the top menu item (""Table"") or the last item on the list, or sometimes just a blank line.</p>

<p>Preferable would be to get the actual names, but even if there was an index value, I could use that to reference an array of the table names.</p>

<p>Other than being ugly, this example works.  But let's say that the IEnumerable contained 2 million elements, then the LINQ statement makes the program execute unbearably slow.  What I want is simple.  I just want the next element in an IEnumberable&lt;>.  All my problems would be solved if there was a function like:</p>

<pre><code>_nextChar = getAlphabet().moveNext() //or getNext()
</code></pre>

<p>It is much preferred if the solution keeps the same structure/layout/functionality of the example however, I am flexible.  My program is a file parser, and among the 2 million lines of text are some keys like ""money=324"" where ""money"" and ""324"" are neighbor elements in the IEnumberable and when the parser comes across ""money"" I want ""324"". (who doesn't? :D  Sorry for bad pun.)</p>

My lib of choice to make my code <em>modular</em> is require.js.</p>

<p>The app will be called Bobby :-)</p>

<p>My code is working if I don't <em>optimize</em> it to a single file. It would be nice to serve Bobby as a single Javascript file that can be included anywhere in the HTML code of the site.</p>

<p>I notice it: I'm a novice with require.js.</p>

<h1>Directory Structure</h1>

<p>The files are organized like this:</p>

<pre><code>bobby
  public
    js
      app -&gt; My custom JS
        bobby.js
        core.js

      lib -&gt; 3rd party JS
        backbone.js
        jquery-1.9.1-min.js
        require.js
        underscore.js

      bootstrap.js -&gt; Main file for require.js
      build.js -&gt; To create js/bobby.js

    index.html -&gt; uses non-optimized version
    index2.html -&gt; uses optimized version (js/bobby.js)
</code></pre>

<h1>The HTML files</h1>

<h2>index.html</h2>

<p>Here I'm trying to be sure that the site's libraries are not overriden with my own versions.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset=""UTF-8""&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Bobby&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.4.3/underscore-min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/0.9.10/backbone-min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

  &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""js/lib/require.js"" data-main=""js/bootstrap.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

  &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
  jQuery(function($){
    console.log(""Host's jQuery: "" + $.fn.jquery); // Should be 1.7.2
    console.log(""Host's Underscore: "" + _.VERSION); // Should be 1.4.3
    console.log(""Host's Backbone: "" + Backbone.VERSION); // Should be 0.9.10
    console.log(""Host's Backbone's jQuery: "" + Backbone.$.fn.jquery);
  });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;HOLA!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I load this file the console logs are correct:</p>

<pre><code>Host's jQuery: 1.7.2 index.html:23
Host's Underscore: 1.4.3 index.html:24
Host's Backbone: 0.9.10 index.html:25
Host's Backbone's jQuery: 1.7.2 index.html:26
Bobby's jQuery: 1.9.1 bobby.js:3
Bobby's Underscore: 1.4.4 bobby.js:4
Bobby's Backbone: 1.0.0 bobby.js:5
</code></pre>

<h2>index2.html</h2>

<p>This is the problematic version. This file uses an <em>optimized</em> version. Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""js/lib/require.js"" data-main=""js/bootstrap.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It uses:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""js/bobby.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the console logs are incorrect:</p>

<pre><code>Host's jQuery: 1.9.1 index2.html:14
Host's Underscore: 1.4.4 index2.html:15
Host's Backbone: 1.0.0 index2.html:16
Host's Backbone's jQuery: 1.9.1 index2.html:17
Bobby's jQuery: 1.9.1 bobby.js:11
Bobby's Underscore: 1.4.4 bobby.js:11
Bobby's Backbone: 1.0.0 bobby.js:11
</code></pre>

<p>but if you execute this in the console:</p>

<pre><code>$.fn.jquery =&gt; ""1.7.2""
bobby.$.fn.jquery =&gt; ""1.9.1""
</code></pre>

<p>it is OK. The same with:</p>

<pre><code>Backbone.VERSION =&gt; ""0.9.10""
bobby.B.VERSION =&gt; ""1.0.0""
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>_.VERSION =&gt; ""1.4.3""
bobby._.VERSION =&gt; ""1.4.4""
</code></pre>

<p>It fails only with the script executed right after the js/bobby.js one is included. That script is using the incorrect versions of the libraries (external instead of site ones).</p>

<h1>The JS files</h1>

<h2>bootstrap.js</h2>

<p>It is supposed that this is what is first loaded so I call noConflict() here for all my 3rd party libraries.</p>

<pre><code>require(['app/core', 'app/bobby'], function(core, bobby) {
    core._.noConflict();
    core.$.noConflict(true);
    core.B.noConflict();

    bobby.initialize();
});
</code></pre>

<h2>app/core.js</h2>

<pre><code>define(['lib/underscore', 'lib/jquery-1.9.1.min', 'lib/backbone'], function(){
    Backbone.$ = jQuery;
    return {
        _: _,
        $: jQuery,
        B: Backbone
    };
});
</code></pre>

<h2>app/bobby.js</h2>

<pre><code>define(['app/core'], function(core){
    var initialize = function() {
        console.log(""Bobby's jQuery: "" + core.$.fn.jquery);
        console.log(""Bobby's Underscore: "" + core._.VERSION);
        console.log(""Bobby's Backbone: "" + core.B.VERSION);

        core.$('body').html('Bobby initialized!');

        window.bobby = core._.extend(window.bobby || {options: {}}, core);
    };

    return {
        'initialize': initialize
    };
});
</code></pre>

<h1>The optimized version</h1>

<p>I use r.js installed globally via npm and a build.js file:</p>

<pre><code>cd bobby/public/js
r.js -o build.js
</code></pre>

<p>And it gives:</p>

<pre><code>Tracing dependencies for: /path/to/bobby/public/js/bobby.js

/path/to/bobby/public/js/app/core.js
/path/to/bobby/public/js/app/bobby.js
/path/to/bobby/public/js/bootstrap.js
</code></pre>

<h2>build.js</h2>

<p>To avoid conflicts with an existing require.js library I've included it namespaced inside <em>bob</em>.</p>

<pre><code>({
    baseUrl: ""."",
    out: ""bobby.js"",
    paths: {
        requireLib: 'lib/require'
    },
    include: [""requireLib"", ""bootstrap""],
    namespace: ""bob""
})
</code></pre>

<h1>Help needed</h1>

<p>Although bobby.js works well after is initialized and it returns the globals to the original libraries, it doesn't work when we execute:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
jQuery(function($){
  ...
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>just after loading the optimized bobby.js file.</p>

<p>The idea is not to force the owner of the site to put the bobby.js file in a concrete place.</p>

<p>What can I do? Thanks!</p>

<p>P.D.: Feel free to use this pattern if you find it useful...</p>

The header is divided into lines, each one ending by <code>\r\n</code>. After the headers, an empty line follows used to separate it from the payload.</p>

<p>Sounds like HTTP? Yes, but it isn't.</p>

<p>For now I'm using <code>byline</code>(<a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/byline"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.npmjs.com/package/byline</a>) to parse the header. My approach is that as soon as I'm parsing the empty line, I remove the current listener from the <code>byline</code> stream.</p>

<p>But as it seems, the stream has already consumed the entire rest of the buffer. So I cannot parse the rest of the data as ""raw"" as I would when only using <code>@socket.on 'data'</code></p>

<p>Here's the snippet in coffeescript I wrote so far (omitting <code>require</code>s etc.):</p>

<pre><code>linestream = byline self.socket
isFirstLine = true
message = null
bodyLength = 0 # &lt;-- This one is set later in the header section
linestream.on 'data', (data) -&gt;
  line = data.toString('utf8')
  unless line == """"
    # This must be a header, parse and process it.
    # ...

  else
    # Stop parsing headers.
    linestream.removeListener 'data', this

    # Consume the rest which is payload
    @socket.on 'data', (data) -&gt;
      payload = data.read bodyLength

(Is this because Coffeescript wraps all their code in an anonymous function?) Currently, I have the code duplicated on both files, but it's WET and smelly and generally unpleasant to be around.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PySide.QtGui.QCompleter can look for completions in tree models, assuming that any item (or sub-item or sub-sub-item) can be unambiguously represented as a string by specifying the path to the item. The completion is then performed one level at a time.</p>
  
  <p>Let’s take the example of a user typing in a file system path. The model is a (hierarchical) PySide.QtGui.QFileSystemModel . The completion occurs for every element in the path. For example, if the current text is C:\Wind , PySide.QtGui.QCompleter might suggest Windows to complete the current path element. Similarly, if the current text is C:\Windows\Sy , PySide.QtGui.QCompleter might suggest System .</p>
  
  <p>For this kind of completion to work, PySide.QtGui.QCompleter needs to be able to split the path into a list of strings that are matched at each level. For C:\Windows\Sy , it needs to be split as “C:”, “Windows” and “Sy”. The default implementation of PySide.QtGui.QCompleter.splitPath() , splits the PySide.QtGui.QCompleter.completionPrefix() using QDir.separator() if the model is a PySide.QtGui.QFileSystemModel .</p>
  
  <p>To provide completions, PySide.QtGui.QCompleter needs to know the path from an index. This is provided by PySide.QtGui.QCompleter.pathFromIndex() . The default implementation of PySide.QtGui.QCompleter.pathFromIndex() , returns the data for the edit role for list models and the absolute file path if the mode is a PySide.QtGui.QFileSystemModel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I can't seem to find an example showing how to do this. <strong>Can anyone point me at an example I can use as a starting point?</strong> (In my investigation it looks like maybe the hard part is the tree model rather than the QCompleter)</p>

<p>It looks like you would need to provide these functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>ability to split a string into segments (for the example given, <code>C:\Windows\Sy</code> to <code>['C:','Windows','Sy']</code> </li>
<li>the ability to specify the list of items that include the last segment (e.g. all the items included in <code>['C:','Windows']</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I found an example for the basic functionality of QCompleter and have been able to tweak the basics fine (see below), I just don't know how to go about implementing a tree model type application.</p>

<li>.</li>
<li>.</li>

<p>Now if a special_user could click on a name, sort or search by the fields, in the end he can view a user application form that a new user did apply for, and special user could have the posibility to accept, if he accepts then the user is no longer on the list of applications he is only visible on the list of that super_user.</p>

<p>Other restrictions: If a user did make a registration with his email, but now he wants to make a double account to apply again he cant apply as that time as a super_user didnt accept his application form</p>

<p>A user can be blacklisted with a reason: 1) not a good person 2) bad neighbour </p>

<p>I think a possible solution would be to compare the product of the two lists (multiply all values together), but there are problems with this solution. What to do with zero and negative numbers. A workaround would be adding 4 to every value before multiplying. Here's the code I have so far.</p>

<p>A 2-D array of 400000 * 400000 integers is not allowed, hence dynamic programming is not an option here. Neither will matrix multiplication help, since it will require storing of 400000 * 400000 2-D array. The Lucas theorem is of no use here since every integer is less than 1000000007, so the number of computations will be the same. I need to calculate:</p>

<pre><code>   SUM( (l+i)Ci * (m + n - i)Cm ) 
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>i</code> ranges from 0 to X; <code>X,l,m,n</code> are fixed. What would be the most efficient algorithm to do so?</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25552802/serving-compressed-assets-in-heroku-with-rack-zippy"">Serving Compressed Assets in Heroku with Rack-Zippy</a></p>

<p>but decided to give up on that service, since I couldn't get it to work.</p>

<p>I ran PageSpeed Insights on my website to determine the speed of my website.</p>

<p>The most important suggestion I received was to Enable Compression.</p>

<pre><code>Compressing resources with gzip or deflate can reduce the number of bytes sent over the network.
Enable compression for the following resources to reduce their transfer size by 191.2KiB 
(74% reduction).
</code></pre>

<p>I've followed the instructions on this website</p>

<p><a href=""https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/EnableCompression"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/EnableCompression</a></p>

<p>and it says to consult the documentation for your web server on how to enable compression:</p>

<p>I've used this website to find out my web server</p>

<p><a href=""http://browserspy.dk/webserver.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://browserspy.dk/webserver.php</a></p>

<p>It turns out that my web server is WEBrick.</p>

<p>The PageSpeed Insights Page only lists the following 3 servers</p>

<pre><code>Apache: Use mod_deflate
Nginx: Use ngx_http_gzip_module
IIS: Configure HTTP Compression
</code></pre>

<p>I've searched for documentation on gzip compression for WEBrick servers but couldn't find anything.</p>

<p>I've searched for how to enable compression in Rails and couldn't find anything. That's why I'm asking here.</p>

<p>I've tried using Rack Zippy but gave up on it.</p>

<p>Right now, I don't even know where to begin. My first step, is finding out what I should do.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I followed Ahmed's suggestion of using Rack::Deflator</p>

<p>I confirmed that I had it by running</p>

<pre><code>rake middleware
=&gt; use Rack::Deflator
</code></pre>

<p>and then</p>

<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m '-'
git push heroku master
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately PageSpeed still says it needs to be compress. I confirmed that by going into Developer Tools &lt;&lt; Network Settings and refreshing the page. Size and content were virtually identical for every resource meaning the files are not compressed.</p>

<p>Is there something wrong with one of my files?</p>

<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Here is my full config/application.rb file</p>

<pre><code>require File.expand_path('../boot', __FILE__)

require 'rails/all'

Bundler.require(*Rails.groups)

module AppName
  class Application &lt; Rails::Application

    config.middleware.use Rack::Deflater
    config.assets.precompile += %w(*.png *.jpg *.jpeg *.gif)
    config.exceptions_app = self.routes

    config.cache_store = :memory_store

  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>If there is a problem, the source is likely over there, right?</p>

<p>Do I need to install the deflator gem?</p>

I was indicated to implement a copy constructor to make the erase function work on a vector, something that is also mentioned in another question. It is essential to implement a function operator in my relevant class. On doing this I get another error on creating the copy constructor and I cannot find the reason for long. The error is “Player::Player(const Player&amp; otherPlayer) does not provide an initiallizer for:” . What am I doing wrong? Take into consideration that Player contains as class members map, pointers and a reference (bank is a reference) . Is a simple assignment adequate for the initialization? </p>

<p>What should I do? </p>

<pre><code>class Player
{
public:
Player(int,int,string, Bank&amp;);
Player(const Player&amp;); 
Player&amp; operator = (const Player&amp; rhs); 


Player::Player(const Player&amp; otherPlayer)
{
ID = otherPlayer.ID;  
pName = otherPlayer.pName;
pMoney = otherPlayer.pMoney;
doubleIndicator = otherPlayer.doubleIndicator;
position = otherPlayer.position;
bank = otherPlayer.bank;
colBought = otherPlayer.colBought;
housesColBuilt = otherPlayer.housesColBuilt;

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
I get a warning at the point of implementantion of the operator= as:""returning address of a local variable or temporary"". Does this evoke a real problem? If so, how could I modify it to get over this?</p>

<pre><code>Player&amp; Player::operator=(const Player&amp; rhs)
{
return Player(rhs);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this way, I still receive a warning that the recursive function will cause stack overflow:</p>

<pre><code>Player&amp; Player::operator=(const Player&amp; rhs)
{
*this = Player(rhs);
return *this;
}

<p>Things to note: The request response time was 924 ms.  But then some kind of strange error happened after that.</p>

<p>This is what that request looks like in terms of <a href=""https://gist.github.com/endymion/5b6dbe95d5d7c5db32be"" rel=""nofollow"">DB queries</a>.  There is nothing exciting happening there, and those DB tables only contain a few hundred rows of data.  There is no reason why the response should take 1 second sometimes, and 15+ seconds on other times.  Here's the code for the extremely simple controller action:</p>

<pre><code>class OverviewController &lt; ApplicationController

  def index
    @current_event = Event.recent
    @areas = Area.order(:position)
    @reservations = Reservation.find(:all,
      :conditions =&gt; { :event_id =&gt; @current_event.id },
      :order =&gt; 'created_at DESC',
      :limit =&gt; 5)
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the Event#recent method, just so that you can see that it's not doing anything that could potentially take 15+ seconds:</p>

<pre><code>def self.recent
  Event.last || Event.create
end
</code></pre>

<p>I'm at a loss for how to get this app stabilized, other than moving it off of Heroku.  I don't know of any way to troubleshoot the problem, and I guess Heroku won't help.  Am I simply stuck?  Do I have any options for troubleshooting the problem other than moving the app to Engine Yard?</p>

<p>For the already defined values, I use the syntax: <code>X1 is 5</code>, and I put this at the top of my code thinking that it would speed up lookup.</p>

<p>Without having to make my code drastically complex, are there any spots where I can make it somewhat more efficient?</p>

<p>Also, I noticed that changing the intdividelargerbysmaller and subtractsmallerfromlarger ""Result is"" to ""Result ="" makes the query take a very long time / not solve, whereas if I use a variable in the third slot it solves with both.</p>

<p>Additionally I noticed that queries take a very long time if I move the row and column checking up to near the beginning.</p>

<p>This is what user gives input as in text area field,</p>

<ol>
<li>The law requires all states to have exchanges, which are essentially online marketplaces where small businesses and individuals can shop for private health plans, in place by January 2014, when a requirement takes effect for most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty.</li>
<li>If states fail to submit plans for running their own exchanges by the deadline, the law calls for the federal government to set up and run one for them, with or without their help. People with incomes between 133 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level can get federal tax subsidies through exchanges to make the price of coverage more affordable</li>

<p>Also I was to preserve the links given in my text area fields along with formatting as entered by the user.</p>

<p>Also I don’t have any framework in my application.I know JSF has got the some features where it escapes the textarea data and renders it via pre elements maintaining the format as given by the users.How can this be done without any framework ?</p>

<p>I have a form with a number of records. In some textboxes I just present values from the underlying table - so they are bound to the corresponding fields.</p>

<p>But some textboxes should contain calculated values. Some calculations are complicated and involves many fields from the table. I write the calculation as a VBA function. I could enter something like this as ""Control Source"":</p>

<pre><code>=MyFunction([Field1], [Field2], [Field3] ...)
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't want to list dozens of fields in the function call. Instead, I want to send the whole form (or the current record) as a parameter, and let the function reference the fields it needs. I can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>=MyFunction([Forms]![MyForm])
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't like having to name the form in the call. Isn't there a way to send the ""current form"" as a function argument? In VBA, you just use the ""Me"" keyword, for exampel ""Me![Field1]"". But it seems like ""Me"" isn't accepted in an expression.</p>

<p>Is there some other way to reference the current form in an expression?</p>

<p>(It's a cosmetic question, I know. But it's not good programming to use ""[Form]![MyForm]"". Later on you copy the controls to another form and forget to change the name in the expression...)</p>

until the user checks the checkbox which has nothing to do with the label and the dropdown.  Once the user checks (or unchecks) the checkbox... the label gets populated with the selection from the dropdown.</p>

<p>All controls are in a table for structure.  I have the scriptmanager in place.</p>

<p>From what I've been reading on the net this maybe a bug... If not a bug does anyone see where I may be going wrong...?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>This board is where the puzzle will be displayed. I have a <code>JButton</code> <code>reset</code> whithin the <code>wheelGUI</code> class, which acts as the main class for the program that all other classes run through. </p>

<p>What I want to happen: Upon a user clicking the <code>JButton reset</code>, the program should read a line from a text file which will act as the puzzle for this round. It should put one character in each box of the board, and leave spaces blank. It should turn any box with a letter occupying it black, to signify that a letter that has yet to be guessed is positioned there. </p>

<p>What's not working: A <code>FileInputStream</code> and <code>BufferedReader</code> don't seem to be compatible with <code>swing</code> components such as a <code>JTextField[]</code>. I'm not sure of another way to read a file into a <code>JTextField[]</code>, or if it's even possible with the way the board is created. Thank you!</p>

Seeing some of the responses out there I learned that I can use environment variables, but this isn't quite what I want.</p>

<p>I'd really like intellij to be able to determine which module has focus, then run using that module's base directory as the runtime path. I have a group of modules that I want to run the same run configuration on at different times. I don't want to have to define separate run configurations for each individual module.</p>

<p>This is how I did it in eclipse, so I'm inclined to want to do it the same way. If perhaps there's a different way to accomplish the same goal, I'm all for it. Here's our use case: </p>

<p>We have a number of jars that each include javascript files. As part of the build process these javascript files are pulled out of the jar and aggregated together in an all.js file. During development we want to be able to update this all.js file on the fly while the server is running. Due to the aggregation step we can't use built-in hotswapping-like functionality to update client resources. For this we have created a run configuration, that when run will aggregate the js and copy it onto the local app server.</p>

<p>This run configuration for eclipse is currently used to do this for multiple projects and is also shared between many developers. Again, the main desire is a generic variable that is agnostic to both the project/module as well as the base path to that module.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, dgrid's configuration is column based, so I can have a column definition like</p>

<pre><code>editor({
    field: ""_dojo_textbox_505ee3a390d705_26717315"", 
    label: ""Name"",
    editorArgs: {
        name: ""order[products][{index}][name]"",
    }
}, TextBox)
</code></pre>

<p>This column definition will define set the same widget name for all rows, which does not work with the ZF2 collection data format requirement.</p>

<p>What I also tried is naming the column like this: </p>

<pre><code>order[products][]
</code></pre>

<p>which works, but does not allow the desired format </p>

<pre><code>order[products][][name]
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe there is a way to post the data like this: </p>

<pre><code>order[products][name][]
</code></pre>

<p>and have it converted afterwards, but the solution doesn't looks right. Beside this I am trying to produce reusable code and want to avoid per-form data modifications.</p>

<p>Since I am trying very hard to avoid onSubmit/onClick event handling for data conversion, there are 2 possible solutions:
1. Make dgrid able to set per-row widget names
2. Make ZF2 form understand some other-than-standard POST format for collections</p>

<p>Unfortunately I ran out of ideas, how either of those solutions can be done, so I will be most thankful, if you can give me a hand with this!</p>

<p>Since this is somewhat related with my current question, I will place it here as a side question:
What other than this UI solution do you use for your one-to-many form interfaces with dojo?</p>

<p>The detected smkx sequence is only ""\E="" which matches the ""infocmp rxvt"" (a poor terminfo entry?).</p>

<p>Now when I run my CLI server and connect to it with a telnet run on a rxvt terminal, the terminal receives the smkx sequence. 
When the user on the rxvt terminal presses a left-arrow key I would expect ""\E[D"" sequence be sent to the CLI server (since the application mode has been set). Unfortunately the sequence is always ""\EOD"" both when the smkx sequence has and has not been sent to the terminal client.</p>

<p>I tried hardcoding the smkx sequence to ""\E[?1h\E="" and sending this to client, but it did not change anything.</p>

<p>There are lots of good practice and one thing I never happen to know about is the <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ComponentCallbacks2.html#onTrimMemory%28int%29"">onTrimMemory(int level)</a> method called by the system on every Activity/Fragment to notify events on which memory should or could be released.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from that article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Notice that your app receives the onTrimMemory() callback with
  TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN only when all the UI components of your app
  process become hidden from the user</strong>. This is distinct from the
  onStop() callback, which is called when an Activity instance becomes
  hidden, which occurs even when the user moves to another activity in
  your app. So although you should implement onStop() to release
  activity resources such as a network connection or to unregister
  broadcast receivers, <strong>you usually should not release your UI resources
  until you receive onTrimMemory(TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN)</strong>. This ensures
  that if the user navigates back from another activity in your app,
  your UI resources are still available to resume the activity quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I only have a few question about it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>is <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ComponentCallbacks2.html#onTrimMemory%28int%29"">onTrimMemory(TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN)</a> called right after the onStop()?</p></li>
<li><p>what ""release your UI resources"" means in that context? just for instance clean the Bitmap cache, or actually remove and destroy every View in the View tree? i usually destroy the Views in the <em>onDestroy()</em> or <em>onDestroyView()</em> methods, i am now wondering if i'm doing it right.</p></li>
<li><p>is there a Twin/correspondent callback to <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ComponentCallbacks2.html#onTrimMemory%28int%29"">onTrimMemory(TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN)</a>? like <em>onCreate-onDestroy</em>, <em>onStart-onStop</em>, <em>onCreateView-onDestroyView</em>. I'am asking to undestand where and how i should restore the UI state after an Activity/Fragment as been brought in FG after <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ComponentCallbacks2.html#onTrimMemory%28int%29"">onTrimMemory(TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN)</a> has been called.</p></li>

<pre><code>httpClient.PostAsync(url, new StringContent(jsonString));
</code></pre>

<p>My server, which is written in java, is using the following code to read:</p>

<pre><code>BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream(), ""UTF-8""));
...
//Here I am using reader.readLine() and read until there is an empty line
...
//Then I get the Content-Length and use reader.read(charArray)
//where charArray have the size of Content-Length
...
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine if the message sent does not contain any strange characters. But if the message being sent contains for example the swedish letter ""ö"" the Content-Length is no longer correct.</p>

<p>Lets say for example that the message sent have a length of 100. If it contains one ö the Content-Length will be set to 101. Then in my server I will try to read 101 bytes but only get 100 (because I am reading as UTF-8) and therefore get stuck in my loop.</p>

<p>I have tried to set the StringContent like this:</p>

<pre><code>new StringContent(jsonString, Encoding.UTF8)
</code></pre>

<p>But it makes no different.
What is the best way to solve this problem so I get the correct Content-Length in the request. The best option for me whould have to change something in the WPF client if possible. However I do not know what should be changed.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I did a little more research and found out that when I receive the string in java it contains the following ""Ã¶"" which represents the letter ""ö"". In order to get the correct string I can then do the following:</p>

<pre><code>String correctString = new String(wrongString.getBytes(""ISO-8859-15""), ""UTF-8"");
</code></pre>

<p>But it feels like there must be a better way to solve this issue. Is there a way to tell WPF's HttpClient to send the data with the right wncoding to begin with?</p>

<p>As it uses ZfcUser as one of its dependencies, two DB tables are created/used by default:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `user`
(
    `user_id`       INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    `username`      VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL UNIQUE,

  `provider_id` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `provider` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`,`provider_id`),
  UNIQUE KEY (`provider_id`,`provider`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `user` (`user_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to add more fields to both tables. </p>

<p>The first step was to alter these tables in my DB server.</p>

<p>Next, I've override User and UserProvider entities/classes (adding properties and their getters and setters) and set up the config files (zfcuser.global.php and scn-social-auth.global.php) so they make use of these new entities. Up to here everything runs smoothly.</p>

<p>Now I want to get user's profile data and save them into these tables at auth time (even using this data to populate a new user record or to update an existing one).</p>

<p>Looking at the ScnSocialAuth\Authentication\Adapter\HybridAuth::authenticate() method I've realized that, when the user is authenticated, only the following fields are set:</p>

<pre><code>user.email
user.password
user.display_name
user_provider.user_id
user_provider.provider_id
user_provider.provider
</code></pre>

<p>leaving my added fields (for example: gender, birth_day, region, etc) blank.</p>

<p>Another thing I've noticed, by checking how \ScnSocialAuth\Authentication\Adapter\HybridAuth class works, is that the entities are hydrated in a ""hardcoded"" way. For example:</p>

<pre><code>protected function facebookToLocalUser($userProfile)
    {
        ...

        $localUser = $this-&gt;instantiateLocalUser();
        $localUser-&gt;setEmail($userProfile-&gt;emailVerified)
            -&gt;setDisplayName($userProfile-&gt;displayName)
            -&gt;setPassword(__FUNCTION__);
        $result = $this-&gt;insert($localUser, 'facebook', $userProfile);

        return $localUser;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone explain which is the best way to extend/override the authenticate() method so I could set these new fields with the values from user's profile? Of course, without modifying the original method.</p>

<p>This is one of the examples I've been looking at, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14455293/async-and-await"">Async and Await</a>. The implementation I've been looking for would look something like this</p>

<pre><code>protected async void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Render when done
    textBox1.Text += await WaitAsynchronouslyAsync(RandomNumber(2000, 4000));

    // Render when done
    textBox1.Text += await WaitAsynchronouslyAsync(RandomNumber(100, 1000));
}

public async Task&lt;string&gt; WaitAsynchronouslyAsync(int delay)
{
    await Task.Delay(delay);
    return string.Concat(delay, ""; "");
}
private int RandomNumber(int min, int max)
{
    Random random = new Random();
    return random.Next(min, max);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will however always render when everything is done, but at the same time. In the example above the desired result would be the second call to <code>WaitAsynchronouslyAsync</code> to render before the first call since it always will be less delay.</p>

<p>Or is it even possible using webforms? I do know how to do this in JavaScript using webapi's, websockets and whatnot and that's <strong>not</strong> the solution I desire at the moment.</p>

<p>Works fine:</p>

<pre><code>char *src1; int esi_out, eax;
__asm__
  __volatile__(
     ""lodsb\n\t;""
     : ""=&amp;S"" (esi_out), ""=&amp;a"" (eax)
     : ""0"" (src1)
);
printf(""src1 %c @ %p, esi_out: %x, eax: %x\n"", *src1, src1, esi_out, eax);
</code></pre>

<p>and prints:</p>

<pre><code>src1 w @ 0x7fffce186959, esi_out: ce18695a, eax: ce186977
</code></pre>

<p>So my understanding it that this code should load the value of src1 (which is an address) into ESI, copy that value into EAX, increment the address in ESI by 1 byte, and then upon exiting, output those values into local C variables esi_out and eax.  src1 and esi_out look correct, but eax seems like it's off.  What's going on here?</p>

<p>The second bit of code is where we see a segfault that I can't quite come to grips with:</p>

<pre><code>__asm__
  __volatile__(
        ""movl %%ebx, %%esi\n\t;""
        //""lodsb\n\t;""                                                                                                                  
        : ""=&amp;S"" (esi_out), ""=&amp;b"" (ebx), ""=&amp;a"" (eax)
        : ""1"" (src1)
);
printf(""src1 %c @ %p, esi_out: %x, eax: %x, ebx: %x\n"", 
                        *src1, src1, esi_out, eax, ebx);
</code></pre>

<p>With the lodsb command commented out, it produces:</p>

<pre><code>src1 w @ 0x7ffff093b959, esi_out: f093b959, eax: f093b959, ebx: f093b959
</code></pre>

<p>And with the lodsb command not commented out, it segfaults.  To my way of thinking, loading the ESI value directly, as in the first case above, and loading it into EBX and then movl'ing it into ESI should be equivalent, no?</p>

<p>What am I missing?  Why does the value written into EAX look off?  I wrote the equivalent program directly into assembly and stepped through it using gdb and it works fine.</p>

<p>Any insight would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I have a prototype site which is structured as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The main HTML page that I want to be available offline is at <code>/offlineDemo/</code>.</li>
<li>The resource files are in <code>/lib/offlineDemo/js/</code>, <code>/lib/offlineDemo/css/</code>, etc.</li>
<li>The cache manifest file is at <code>/lib/offlineDemo/assets/offlineDemo.appcache</code>.</li>
<li>The HTML page begins with:<br>
<code>&lt;html manifest='/lib/offlineDemo/assets/offlineDemo.appcache'&gt;</code><br>(after the doctype of course).</li>
</ul>

<p>This seems to be working fine in Chrome. Having loaded the page once, I can disconnect the network and I'm still able to reload it without any problems.</p>

<p>However on Firefox it's not working. I'm trying to debug it using the dev tools command-line, and odd things are happening.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Typing <code>appcache list</code> shows me a list of all the files in my site except for the main HTML page itself. The files that are listed show with file size 0 and don't appear to have actually been cached.</p></li>
<li><p>Typing <code>appcache validate</code> gives me a list of errors relating to trying to parse a 404 page as a manifest file. It appears to be trying to validate a manifest file at the following URL: <code>/offlineDemo//lib/offlineDemo/assets/offlineDemo.appcache</code></p>

<p>ie it's appending the manifest URL to the end of the page's URL without considering the fact that I've defined the manifest as an absolute URL. Obviously the URL it is trying to load is invalid and gives a 404.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn't seem like correct behaviour so I'm guessing it may be a Firefox bug, especially as it is working fine in Chrome. However all the examples I've found for AppCache show a relative URL in the html manifest attribute, so that leaves me wondering.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are absolute URLs valid for referencing a manifest file?</li>
<li>If they are, why is it not working in Firefox?</li>
<li>If they're not, why not, and is there a work-around?</li>
<li>Or am I just doing something stupid and mis-interpreting the debug info?</li>

<p>I'd like to be able to write</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""first.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""second.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>in my markup and, using the code in <code>first.js</code>, prevent or delay the execution of <code>second.js</code>. Is this possible, in any browser? What if the contents of <code>first.js</code> are inlined? (If it helps, assume that the second script tag has an <code>id</code> attribute.)</p>

<p>Since I've gotten a couple of answers that missed what I'm getting at, I should clarify:</p>

<ol>
<li>The solution must be entirely within <code>first.js</code>. Anything that require changes to the original HTML of the page, or to <code>second.js</code>, is not acceptable.</li>
<li>It <em>is</em> acceptable to load <code>second.js</code> via Ajax and execute it using <code>eval</code>. That's the easy part. The hard part is preventing the immediate execution of <code>second.js</code>.</li>
<li>Assume that you <strong>don't know</strong> what's in <code>second.js</code>. So, you can't just replace each global function called by <code>second.js</code> with a no-op function. (Plus, this would almost certainly lead to errors.)</li>
</ol>

<p>If you know of a solution that works in some browsers but not in others, I'd love to hear it.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: To make this a little more concrete, let's say that the code</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
  function func() {
    window.meaningOfLife = 42;
    window.loadSecond();
  };
  setTimeout(func, 10);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>precedes the two <code>script</code> includes, and that <code>second.js</code> contains the line</p>

<pre><code>if (window.meaningOfLife !== 42) {throw new Error();}
</code></pre>

<p><code>first.js</code> should be able to prevent this error by delaying <code>second.js</code> from executing until <code>window.loadSecond</code> is run. (Assume the implementation of <code>window.loadSecond</code> is also in <code>first.js</code>.) It is <strong>not</strong> allowed to touch <code>window.meaningOfLife</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Alohci's answer meets these requirements, but only on the condition that the second script tag comes <em>immediately</em> after the first, with nothing but whitespace in between. If someone could extend his hack to avoid that requirement, without introducing other unwanted consequences, that would be amazing...</p>

<p>It's an add-on for timekeeping. Users can configure meetings settings (duration, participants... etc) through a Panel. There is a toolbar. It contains several buttons (Start, Next, Stop, Add Participant) and a Frame (to display how many participants haven't speaked yet). I change the <code>document.border.style</code> property from ""green"" to ""red"" as timers countdown.</p>

<p>This works fine. But I was asked to make my add-on play a sound when the <code>document.border.style</code> property turns ""orange"" and then ""red"" and I can't make it works.</p>

<p>I have tried several things :</p>

<p>1-Adding a property/attribute (I don't know which term is the right to use in that context, maybe both, anyway) to my TimeKeeper variable for each sound that has to be played. Meaning in my code :</p>

<pre><code>orangeBorderStyle: new Audio(relativePathToMyMp3orWAVFile),
redBorderStyle: new Audio(relativePathToMyMp3orWAVFile),
</code></pre>

<p>and then calling their play() method in the countdown() method. But it didn't work.</p>

<p>2-Currently, I'm trying to play the sounds from HTML5 audio tags I added to the frame.url HTML file. But it doesn't work either.</p>

<p>The HTML file looks like this :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=""utf-8""/&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Frame&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""../javascript/Frame_script.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    Speakers Left : &lt;input id=""speakers"" size=""4"" value="""" disabled /&gt;
    &lt;audio id=""orangeSound"" src=""Audio/orangeBorderSoundTest.mp3"" type=""audio/mpeg""&gt;
            Your browser does not support the audio element.
    &lt;/audio&gt;
    &lt;audio id=""redSound"" src=""Audio/redBorderSoundTest.mp3"" type=""audio/mpeg""&gt;
            Your browser does not support the audio element.
    &lt;/audio&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In Frame_script.js I have :</p>

<pre><code>window.addEventListener(""message"", reactToMessages, false);


var orangeBorderSound=document.getElementById(""orangeSound"");
var redBorderSound=document.getElementById(""redSound"");
//console.log(orangeBorderSound);

function reactToMessages(e){
    if(isNaN(e.data)==false){
    displaySpeakersLeft(e);
    }

if(e.data==""orangeBorderSound"")
{
    document.getElementById(""orangeSound"").play();
    //console.log(""Je joue le son Orange."");
} else if(e.data==""redBorderSound"")
{
    document.getElementById(""redSound"").play();
    //console.log(""Je joue le son Rouge."");
}
}

function displaySpeakersLeft(e){
    document.getElementById(""speakers"").value=e.data;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and in Timers.js I have the following calls :</p>

<pre><code>Frame.get().postMessage(""orangeBorderSound"", Frame.get().url);
Frame.get().postMessage(""redBorderSound"", Frame.get().url);
</code></pre>

<p>Both calls trigger the right code (when the console.log() are commented out, they are displayed correctly) but there is no sound in the end.</p>

<p>Please, note that the <code>value</code> of the input tag with ID ""speakers"" is correctly displayed in my add-on so it seems that the document.getElementById() methods returns the right thing, and that it is the right way to do things with an input tag. Meaning, the paths are the right ones.  I can't see why it would be different with audio tags.</p>

<p>So here comes my question : I now see the error ""Security Error: Content at moz-nullprincipal:... may not load or link to resource..."" (the  resource path given seems to be the right one for each audio file) in the Error Console.</p>

<p>Is this really a security issue ? Or would I have little to change to make my code works ? What would you do ?</p>

<p>Any explanation or suggestion would be appreciated. I really don't see what's wrong with what I've done. Why would it cause security problems ?</p>

<p>Please, note that I've tried to use the audio tags method in a new add-on with just a Play button in the Panel and nothing else, but this time with the audio tags in the Panel contentURL HTML file, calling the play() method in the contentScriptFile and it worked.</p>

<p>No security error this time.</p>

<p>But I suppose I can't accept such a solution in my timekeeping add-on since I need to synchronize the call of the play() method with the change of the border style and that there is no Play button this time. It does not correspond to what I want to obtain. It was just for testing purpose.</p>

<p>Timers.js which is in my lib directory cannot interact with the Panel contentScriptFile which is in the data directory, so it couldn't be a solution even if the sounds were correctly loaded and ready to be played.</p>

<p>What do I get wrong ?</p>

The folks at ZXing have solved this problem by calling autofocus() every few seconds, but on some cameras this doesn't focus smoothly, but zips to one end and refocuses. On my Alcatel 995, gingerbread 2.3.3 API level 10 phone, it actually makes an alarming click every time this happens.</p>

<p>This phone doesn't support FOCUS_MODE_CONTINUOUS_PICTURE. I tried using FOCUS_MODE_CONTINUOUS_VIDEO, which is supported, and it didn't work. I wrote a test app that captured every preview frame of the camera normally with a callback, but it didn't focus. I added a video recorder feature to the app, and when video is being recorded, the camera does autofocus all the time. But video recording takes away the ability to get a callback on each frame, I think. It's been discussed at
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9477042/extract-video-frames-while-recording-the-video-on-android?rq=1"">Extract video frames while recording the video on android</a>
and
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12352615/how-to-show-real-time-filtered-camera-preview-while-recording-videos?rq=1"">How to show real time filtered camera preview while recording videos?</a></p>

<p>Here is some of that test code:</p>

<pre><code>public void surfaceCreated(SurfaceHolder holder) {
    mCamera = Camera.open();
    try {
        Camera.Parameters parameters = mCamera.getParameters();
        mCamera.setDisplayOrientation(90); // just get it right for testing
        mCamera.setParameters(parameters);
        mCamera.setPreviewDisplay(holder);
        mCamera.setPreviewCallback(new PreviewCallback() {
            public void onPreviewFrame(byte[] data, Camera arg1) {
                Log.d(TAG, String.format(""Frame %d"", mFrameNumber++)); // see the frames in the logcat
            }
        });
    } catch (IOException exception) {
        mCamera.release();
        mCamera = null;
        Log.d(TAG, ""exception setting parameters"");
    }
}

public void surfaceChanged(SurfaceHolder holder, int format, int w, int h) {
// Now that the size is known, set up the camera parameters and begin
// the preview.
    Camera.Parameters parameters = mCamera.getParameters();
    List&lt;Size&gt; previewSizes = parameters.getSupportedPreviewSizes();
    Size previewSize = getOptimalPreviewSize(previewSizes, w, h);
    parameters.setPreviewSize(previewSize.width, previewSize.height);
    parameters.setFocusMode(Parameters.FOCUS_MODE_CONTINUOUS_VIDEO); 
    mCamera.setParameters(parameters);
    mCamera.startPreview();
    if (mRecordingVideo)
        startVideo(mCamera, holder);
}

// derived from http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera.html#capture-video
private void startVideo(Camera camera, SurfaceHolder holder) {
    camera.stopPreview(); // not specified in documentation but seems to be needed
    camera.unlock();
    mMediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder();
    mMediaRecorder.setCamera(camera);
    mMediaRecorder.setVideoSource(MediaRecorder.VideoSource.CAMERA); // No audio is recorded
    mMediaRecorder.setOutputFormat(MediaRecorder.OutputFormat.MPEG_4);
    mMediaRecorder.setVideoEncoder(MediaRecorder.VideoEncoder.MPEG_4_SP);
    mMediaRecorder.setOutputFile(""/dev/null"");
    try {
        mMediaRecorder.setPreviewDisplay(holder.getSurface());
        mMediaRecorder.prepare();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        camera.release();
        Log.d(TAG, ""startVideo: Failed."");
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    mMediaRecorder.start();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I set <code>mRecordingVideo</code> in the above code to start the video recorder, I gain autofocus but lose the per-preview-frame callbacks.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.Parameters.html#FOCUS_MODE_CONTINUOUS_VIDEO"" rel=""nofollow"">Camera.Parameters</a> class definition says that FOCUS_MODE_CONTINUOUS_VIDEO is ""intended for video recording"" but doesn't make plain that it doesn't work otherwise.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there anything else I can do to persuade continuous autofocus to work in a gingerbread phone without recording video? Have I missed something out?</li>
<li>Is this phone-specific? Do other phones continuous autofocus in this mode without recording video? I posted the source of a complete test app to <a href=""https://github.com/emrys57/TestPreview2"" rel=""nofollow"">Github</a> if anyone would like to try it on their phone.</li>

Scala plugin v0.36.431 had been installed. While I created a new Scala SBT project with wizard, there was no <code>src/</code> directory structure generated in the project. Only two sbt files were generated:</p>

<pre><code>scala-course/
├── build.sbt
└── project
    └── plugins.sbt
</code></pre>

<p>From the video and other document I know that there should be a <code>src/</code> directory structure, including <code>src/main/scala</code>, <code>src/test/scala</code>, etc. sbt uses the same directory structure as Maven for source files by default.</p>

<p>I can create those folders manually and mark it as source root. However it is trivial. So my question is: Why IntelliJ IDEA new project wizard doesn't generate the directory structure as said in document? Was I doing something wrong? I checked the preferences and couldn't find anything that seems related.</p>

The problem is that whether I launch a clean install in IntelliJ or in a console, I don't get the same results. JAXB is reading an XML file encoded in UTF-8, which contains special characters.</p>

<p>In IntelliJ, these characters are read without any problem.
But in the console, these characters are replaced with '?' (I can see it if I do a sysout).</p>

<p>I found the source of my problem, but I don't really understand it and I don't know how to solve it: when IntelliJ runs mvn, it adds an extra parameter <code>-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8</code></p>

<pre><code>java -classpath /usr/share/maven/boot/plexus-classworlds-2.4.jar -Dclassworlds.conf=/usr/share/maven/bin/m2.conf -Dmaven.home=/usr/share/maven -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 org.codehaus.plexus.classworlds.launcher.Launcher clean install
</code></pre>

<p>When I run mvn in command line, I can add this extra parameter but it will appear <em>after</em> the class name:</p>

<pre><code>java -classpath /usr/share/maven/boot/plexus-classworlds-2.4.jar -Dclassworlds.conf=/usr/share/maven/bin/m2.conf -Dmaven.home=/usr/share/maven org.codehaus.plexus.classworlds.launcher.Launcher -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install
</code></pre>

<p>In both cases, if I sysout the content of <code>System.getProperty(""file.encoding"")</code>, I get the same value ""UTF-8"", but a different behaviour.</p>

<p>Of course I configured my pom.xml correctly using a property like this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;</code></p>

<p>I also tried to add a second property named ""file.encoding"" but it does not help.</p>

<p>My question is: why does the position of this system property change the behaviour of my program, and how can I fix my problem when I run mvn from command line?</p>

That dependency uses the weka library, specifically the <a href=""http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/nz.ac.waikato.cms.weka/weka-dev/3.7.5/weka/filters/supervised/attribute/AddClassification.java?av=f"" rel=""nofollow"">AddClassification class</a> that in its <code>AddClassification.setOptions()</code> method uses the <code>java.io.FILE</code> class to read a given model file.
Maybe its also important to notice that this project is a dependency of other maven projects and that in the end it will be used by a web app application running inside apache-tomcat.</p>

<p>For clarification the method <code>AddClassification.setOptions()</code> is called like this:</p>

<pre><code>AddClassification filter = new AddClassification();
filter.setInputFormat(labeled);
String[] options = new String[3];
options[0] = ""-serialized"";
options[1] = ""models/trained.model"";
options[2] = ""-classification"";
filter.setOptions(options);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>So, down to my problems and needs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I need to pass a file path string to the <code>AddClassification.setOptions()</code>;</li>
<li>I need to use the weka library as this little dependency wasn't codded by myself;</li>
<li>All model files should be inside the Jar file (src/main/resources) to allow convenient distribution;</li>
<li><code>java.io.File</code> won't read files inside the Jar file directly <em>(i have looked it up)</em>;</li>
<li>I know that <code>class.getResourceAsStream</code> would solve the problem nicely but the weka library wants a String parameter to use <code>java.io.File</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>How can i solve the problem? I could easily copy all resources to a hardcoded system directory but that would make my project a pain to distribute to other systems.
I'm looking for a correct way to solve the problem.</p>

<p>I hope that i made myself clear enough.</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>The bean is decorated with <code>@RequestScoped</code>. <code>DataStore</code> is an application scoped bean where the <code>List&lt;Category&gt;</code> is created and stored.</p>

<p>The given command link does not trigger the action listener method (<code>action()</code>) in the managed bean unless either the bean is decorated with <code>@ViewScoped</code> (or wider) or the lazy data model is removed.</p>

<p>Thus, changing,</p>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p:dataGrid var=""dRow"" value=""#{testBean.categories}"" .../&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>will work i.e. the <code>&lt;p:commandLink&gt;</code> will invoke the action listener given (The lazy data model is excluded here. The given <code>&lt;p:dataGrid&gt;</code> is directly populated by a <code>List&lt;Category&gt;</code> from the backing bean).</p>

<p>Another alternative is to use a wider scoped bean like a view scoped bean as stated earlier.</p>

<p>Is it possible to use a request scoped bean along with a lazy data model in the given situation so that command components inside those components can work? I have many such view scoped beans just because of <code>&lt;p:commandLink&gt;</code>s inside a <code>&lt;p:carousel&gt;</code> wrapped by a <code>&lt;p:dataGrid&gt;</code> which could otherwise have simply been declared request scoped.</p>

<p>I edited the WebServiceReply class so that all the possible return objects extend from a new class ReturnValueBase, and added the annotations using @XmlSeeAlso to ReturnValueBase. JAXB worked properly after that!</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I'm still learning about JAXB marshalling in JAX-WS, so it would be great if anyone can still post any tutorial on this.</p>

<p>Gregory: you might want to add-on to your answer that the return objects need to sub-class from ReturnValueBase. Thanks a lot for your help! I had been going bonkers over this problem for so long! </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> On running <code>rvm install ruby-1.9.3,engine:jruby,engine_version:1.7.9</code> at the prompt, rvm proceeds to install <code>ruby-1.9.3-p484</code>. And once again, it shows the same error message on entering the project directory:</p>

<p>The readme that comes with MPICH2 has the following instructions:</p>

<ol>
<li>create a makefile</li>
<li>add <code>–I...mpich2\include</code></li>
<li>add <code>–L...mpich2\lib</code></li>
<li>add <code>–lmpi</code></li>
<li>add the rules for your source files</li>
<li>compile</li>
</ol>

<p>Since there are no other rules in my project, I don't create a makefile, I just go to the command line and try compiling like this:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -I""C:\Program Files\MPICH2\include"" main.cpp -L""C:\Program Files\MPICH2\lib"" -lmpi
</code></pre>

<p>This gives me a fistful of <code>undefined reference</code> errors on every single MPI symbol in the code. I spent hours trying to fix it, juggling <code>-I</code>, <code>-L</code> and <code>-l</code> switches around, shuffling the order of the parameters, even copied all the .lib files into the same directory as my source, but nothing seems to work.</p>

<p>What kind of voodoo is needed to get this thing to link?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: I think I found the problem: here's an excerpt of the linker's output in verbose mode (adding <code>-Wl,--verbose</code> to the compile command):</p>

<pre><code>attempt to open C:\Program Files\MPICH2\lib/libmingwex.dll.a failed
attempt to open C:\Program Files\MPICH2\lib/mingwex.dll.a failed

attempt to open C:\Program Files\MPICH2\lib/mingwex.dll failed
attempt to open C:\Program Files\MPICH2\lib\libmingwex.a failed
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently, the linker adds a <code>/</code> instead of a <code>\</code> to the directory names I supply it with (except when looking for the <code>lib___.a</code> format for some reason), which is obviously not a valid path. Is there any way to tell the linker to use backslashes instead of slashes?</p>

<p>This also caught my eye:</p>

<pre><code>attempt to open /mingw/lib/libmingwex.a succeeded
</code></pre>

<p>So I tried compiling like this:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -I""/Program Files/MPICH2/include"" -L""/Program Files/MPICH2/lib"" objManager.cpp ongom.cpp io.cpp main.cpp -lmpi -lcxx

<p>I verified my version of the wordpress api, and sure enough in class-wp-xmlrpc-server.php I see the comment in the new post function section:
""* post_thumbnail - ID of a media item to use as the post thumbnail/featured image""</p>

<p>All the other properties are working. I can add new images to the media library via XML-RPC. I can create and update posts and set their tags, titles, descriptions, custom field values, and categories. I don't get any errors when I try to set the post_thumbnail value.

The classes I am working on has the following hierarchical relationship:    </p>

<pre><code>public class RandomForest extends Classifier {
       public Bagging m_bagger;
       public String toString(){
              return ""other""+m_bagger.toString(); 
       }

}

       // no relative declaration 
       // no toString()
}
public abstract class IteratedSingleClassifierEnhancer extends SingleClassifierEnhancer{
       public Classifier[] m_Classifiers;

       protected Classifier m_Classifier = new ZeroR();
       // no toString()
}
public abstract class Classifier{
       // no toString()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Before I change it, the codes work well.<br>
After I change it, if I read in the data and train a WEKA model myself, it also works very well.<br>
However, if I load the model my professor gives me, then run the toString(), it reports these lines:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.NullPointerException
    at weka.classifiers.trees.RandomTree.leafString(RandomTree.java:656)
    at weka.classifiers.trees.RandomTree.toString(RandomTree.java:678)
    at weka.classifiers.trees.RandomTree.toString(RandomTree.java:707)
    at weka.classifiers.trees.RandomTree.toString(RandomTree.java:700)
</code></pre>

<p>It repeats these lines infinitely until I run out of memory.  </p>

<p>I have debugged and find out the bug is at </p>

<pre><code>m_Classifiers[i].toString()   
</code></pre>

<p>The related codes are (in the class of RandomForest):</p>

<pre><code>if (m_classifier.m_bagger.m_Classifiers == null) {
        System.out.println(""Bagging: No model built yet."");
    } 
else {
        StringBuffer text = new StringBuffer();
        text.append(""All the base classifiers: \n\n"");
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; m_classifier.m_bagger.m_Classifiers.length; i++)
              text.append(m_classifier.m_bagger.m_Classifiers[i].toString()+""\n\n"");  //It goes wrong here

        if (m_classifier.m_bagger.m_CalcOutOfBag) {
            text.append(""Out of bag error: ""
                    + Utils.doubleToString(
                    m_classifier.m_bagger.m_OutOfBagError, 4)
                    + ""\n\n"");
    }
System.out.println(text.toString());
</code></pre>

<p>It behaves the same if I call methods (instead of use public variables). </p>

<p>An interesting fact is that I cannot locate the definition of this toString() at all. It reports ""source not found"" when I press F3 (in eclipse means go to definition) on this specific toString() (not others)<br>
I have no idea where goes wrong, can somebody help me please?</p>

<p>Thank you a million. </p>

<p>Just for clarification:<br>
It should not be the problem of index <em>i</em> since I have tried other functions like </p>

<pre><code>m_Classifiers[i].debugTipText()
</code></pre>

<p>It works perfect.<br>
For the same reason, I do not think m_Classifiers could be null<br>
I changed some 'protected' to 'public', but it does not work before I make this change. </p>

<p>To respond to Jim's comment, here is the githup code for <code>RandomTree.java</code><br>
<a href=""https://github.com/HaohanWang/WekaRandomForest/blob/master/src/weka/classifiers/trees/RandomTree.java"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/HaohanWang/WekaRandomForest/blob/master/src/weka/classifiers/trees/RandomTree.java</a><br>
Sorry that I did not paste code here, because there are about 100 lines of relative code, through Line 626 to Line 715<br>
There are actually more lines in the eclipse error,related to Line 656,Line 678 Line 700, Line 707, and Line 642. All these lines are calling either <code>leafString()</code> or <code>toString(int)</code><br>
Now I am guessing my problem is that I do not have an appropriate int for <code>toString(int)</code></p>

<p>I have the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>404 Page Not Found</p>
  
  <p>The page you requested was not found.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Posted below are my code files.</p>

<p>My Controller code:</p>

<pre><code>class Contact extends CI_Controller{

  function _Contact(){
    parent::CI_Controller();
  }

  /*function main(){
    $this-&gt;load-&gt;model('contact_model');
    $data = $this-&gt;books_model-&gt;general();

    $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('books_main',$data);
  }*/

  function input(){

    $this-&gt;load-&gt;helper('form');  
    $this-&gt;load-&gt;helper('html');      
    $this-&gt;load-&gt;model('contact_model');

    if($this-&gt;input-&gt;post('mysubmit')==true){
        $this-&gt;contact_model-&gt;entry_insert();
    }   

    $data = $this-&gt;contact_model-&gt;general();

    $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('contact_input',$data);   
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in Model I have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>class contact_model extends CI_Model{

  function _contact_model(){
    parent::Model();
    $this-&gt;load-&gt;helper('url');               
  }

  function entry_insert(){
    $this-&gt;load-&gt;database();
    $data = array(
              'name'=&gt;$this-&gt;input-&gt;post('title'),
          'address'=&gt;$this-&gt;input-&gt;post('author'),

              'year'=&gt;$this-&gt;input-&gt;post('year'),

            );
    $this-&gt;db-&gt;insert('contact',$data);
  }

  function general(){

    $data['base']       = $this-&gt;config-&gt;item('base_url');

    $data['name']      = 'Name';
    $data['address']     = 'Address';

    $data['year']       = 'Year';
    $data['years']      = array('2007'=&gt;'2007',
                                '2008'=&gt;'2008',
                                '2009'=&gt;'2009'); 

    $data['forminput']  = 'Student Registration';

    $data['fname']     = array('name'=&gt;'name',
                                'size'=&gt;30
                          );
    $data['faddress']    = array('name'=&gt;'address',
                                'size'=&gt;30
                          );

    return $data;   
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, my View:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id=""header""&gt;
&lt;?php $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('contact_header'); ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;?php echo heading($forminput,3) ?&gt;
&lt;?php echo form_open('books/input'); ?&gt;
&lt;?php echo $name       .' : '.
        form_input($fname).br(); ?&gt;
&lt;?php echo $address      .' : '.
        form_input($faddress).br(); ?&gt;

&lt;?php echo $year        .' : '.
        form_dropdown('year',$years).br(); ?&gt;

&lt;?php echo form_submit('mysubmit','Submit!');  ?&gt;
&lt;?php echo form_close(); ?&gt;

&lt;div id=""footer""&gt;
&lt;?php $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('contact_footer'); ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
