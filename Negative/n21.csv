<p>Is there a way to configure couchbase to clean the index ?</p>

We recently made modifications to the app.config file, cleaned and rebuilt the project, and deployed it to the AOT.  If I go into the SqlServer Management Studio and query the VSASSEMBLIES table, I can see the corresponding .dll and .dll.config files.  I dumped the content for the .dll.config and converted it back to text to make sure the version in the table is the most recent, and it is.</p>

<p>The problem is that the .dll.config file is never getting written out to disk (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics AX\60\Server[Instance]\bin\VSAssemblies) when the AOS restarts.  The .dll gets written out, but not the config.  If I wipe out the entire directory and restart the AOS, everything gets written back out except our config file.</p>

<p>The config file for EInvoiceCFDI_MX.dll gets written out, so I have scoured their project files and configurations and cannot come up with anything they have set that we don't.</p>

<pre><code>function clone(obj) {
  if (null == obj || ""object"" != typeof obj) return obj;
  var copy = obj.constructor();
  for (var attr in obj) {
    if (obj.hasOwnProperty(attr)) copy[attr] = clone(obj[attr]);
  }
  return copy;

<p>3.Functions related to current page, that use selectors based on page elements, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>$('#range-from, #range-to').keypress(function (e) {
  //if the letter is not digit then display error and don't type anything

Only solutions I've seen so far is setting configurations in <code>oozie workflow.xml</code> or setting <code>JobConf.setUseNewMapper(true)</code> and <code>JobConf.setUseNewReducer(true)</code> inside own mapreduce. So my question is: how can I enable it by default, so every single job would use it? I mean Hive, HBase and etc. generated jobs. I tried setting <code>mapred.mapper.new-api</code> and <code>mapred.mapper.new-api</code> to true in <code>mapred-site.xml</code> but it doesn't work.</p>

I think new properties only works on new api, because after setting <code>mapreduce.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum</code> and <code>mapreduce.tasktracker.reduce.tasks.maximum</code> in <code>mapred-site.xml</code> to other than the default value, I still get default value (2). And if I set deprecated properties - <code>mapred.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum</code> and <code>mapred.tasktracker.reduce.tasks.maximum</code> it works like a charm.</p>

However, I would like to store this database online, so multiple people can vote at once, then the results are displayed. How can I go about doing this?

"16820349","1","16823020","","2013-05-29 17:29:55","","2","3112","<p>I'm trying to write the code to annotate a field in a class so that the value of that field is set from a config file.  This is virtually identical to the @Value attribute that the spring framework has, but for reasons I won't go into, I'm not using the spring framework.</p>

<p>The project I'm working on is a web app using the Jersey framework.  I apologize for all the up-front information, but for the sake of completeness, here's a basic setup of what I have:</p>

<p>This is the main application class:</p>

<pre><code>package com.ttrr.myservice;

import com.ttrr.myservice.controllers.MyController;

import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

@ApplicationPath(""/"")
public class MyApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getClasses() {
        final Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; classes = new HashSet&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt;();
        // register root resources            
        classes.add(MyController.class);

        return classes;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the MyController class, that I want annotations to work in:</p>

<pre><code>package com.ttrr.myservice.controllers;

import com.ttrr.myservice.annotations.Property;

import javax.servlet.ServletContext;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;

@Path(""test"")
public class MyController {

    @Property(""my.value.from.config"")
    private String myValue;

    @GET
    @Produces(""text/html"")
    @Path(""/testPage"")
    public String testPage(@Context ServletContext context) {        

        return ""&lt;p&gt;"" + myValue + ""&lt;/p&gt;"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My annotations interface is pretty straight forward:</p>

<pre><code>package com.ttrr.myservice.annotations;

import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

@Target(ElementType.FIELD)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface Property {
    String value() default """";
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I have an annotation parser class:</p>

<pre><code>package com.ttrr.myservice.annotations;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.lang.reflect.Field;
import java.util.Properties;

public class PropertyParser {

    public static Properties properties;

    static {
        properties = new Properties();
        try {
            Property.class.getClassLoader();

            Properties defaults = new Properties();
            defaults.load(Property.class.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(""application.properties""));

            for(Object key : defaults.keySet()) {
                properties.put(key, defaults.get(key));
            }

        } catch (IOException e) {
            //in this case do nothing, properties will simply be empty
        }
    }

    public void parse(Class&lt;?&gt; clazz) throws Exception {

        Field[] fields = clazz.getDeclaredFields();

        for (Field field : fields) {
            if (field.isAnnotationPresent(Property.class)) {
                Property property = field.getAnnotation(Property.class);
                String value = property.value();

                if (!"""".equals(value)) {
                    field.set(clazz, properties.getProperty(value));
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where I'm really struggling is putting it all together, and getting the value from my application.properties file into an instance of the MyController class.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read all that!  Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

string xml;

using (var writer = new StringWriter()) {

<pre><code>{{'id': &lt;id1&gt;, 'email': &lt;email address for id 1&gt;, 'phone': &lt;phone number for id 1&gt;}, {'id': &lt;id2&gt;, 'email': &lt;email address for id 2&gt;, 'phone': &lt;phone number for id 2&gt;}}
</code></pre>

<p>Does such a configuration exist?</p>

<p>I am using Hibernate 4.</p>

<p>I have parent-child relationships in my entity. By default, I have used lazy loading for all the collections in my parent entity. However, in some cases, I need to load the whole object graph. In such cases, I want to force hibernate to load all the collections. I know that by using <code>criteria.setFetchMode(""collectionName"",FetchMode.JOIN)</code>, I can load a specific collection. However, if I tried to do that for multiple collections, I am getting <code>org.hibernate.loader.MultipleBagFetchException: cannot simultaneously fetch multiple bags</code>. </p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<p><strong>Entity</strong> </p>

<p>Ignoring a few fields and getter and setter methods </p>

<pre><code>public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    @Column(name = ""EmployeeId"")
    private long id;

    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @Fetch(FetchMode.SELECT)
    @JoinColumn(name = ""EmployeeId"")
    @LazyCollection(LazyCollectionOption.TRUE)
    private List&lt;EmployeeAddress&gt; employeeAddresses;

    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @Fetch(FetchMode.SELECT)
    @JoinColumn(name = ""EmployeeId"")
    @LazyCollection(LazyCollectionOption.TRUE)
    private List&lt;EmployeeLanguage&gt; employeeLanguages;

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>HibernateUtil</strong></p>

<pre><code>public HibernateUtil{

    public TEntity findById(Class&lt;TEntity&gt; clazz, long id) {
            Session session = sessionFactory.getCurrentSession();
            Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(clazz);
            criteria.add(Restrictions.eq(""id"",id));
            ClassMetadata metadata = sessionFactory.getClassMetadata(clazz);

            String[] propertyNamesArray = metadata.getPropertyNames();
            for(int i=0;i&lt;propertyNamesArray.length;i++){
                criteria.setFetchMode(propertyNamesArray[i], FetchMode.JOIN);
            }
            return (TEntity)criteria.uniqueResult();
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Service</strong></p>

<pre><code>private void getAllEmployee(Employee employee) {
         //invoke the findAll method of hibernateutil
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to have eager-loading of all the collections of Employee in findAll() method. 
Please tell me how to get that done.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25814568/is-it-possible-to-use-pyyaml-to-read-a-text-file-written-with-a-yaml-front-matt"">this answer</a> Python is unable to parse YAML. So the following is the first part that i need as it only selects only the front matter:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python2.7

import yaml

def get_yaml(f):
  pointer = f.tell()
  if f.readline() != '---\n':
    f.seek(pointer)
    return ''
  readline = iter(f.readline, '')
  readline = iter(readline.next, '---\n')
  return ''.join(readline)
</code></pre>

<p>How do I now extract ""Title:""??</p>

<p>I want my controller method to listen example ""/form#tab2"" path, but the problem is that the URL is always ""/form"" regardless of what tab is selected. Is there any way to go around this?</p>

<p>I know the above doesn't work, but that's what I would want. Form.jsp is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class=""nav nav-tabs"" role=""tablist""&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=""tab-content""&gt;

<p>What I would like to do is for handleMessage to return the entire inputStream</p>

<p>Then within the javascript on the client's webpage to recieve that input stream :</p>

<pre><code>...

<p>The objective is to launch ssh connection (no input really required - although with input would be of benefit for further client calls...</p>

<p>Once connected to run </p>

<pre><code>handleMessage(session.getInputStream(),usersession)
</code></pre>

<p>This then returns the stream from the connection back to the javascript frontend.</p>

<p>At the moment I can see a connection to handleMessage but nothing is being returned to javascript frontend...</p>

<p>So I guess its related to how do you stream inputstreams via a javascript frontend.....</p>

This will allow me to extrapolate how the performance would be on a non-multitasking environment, i.e., where only one program is running (most of the time), or on different workloads.  </p>

<p>Usually two kinds of time are measured:</p>

<ul>
<li>The wall-clock time (i.e., the time since the process started) but this includes the time when the process was swapped out.</li>
<li>The processor time (i.e., sum total of CPU time used by all threads) but this is not useful to compute the latency of the process. </li>
</ul>

<p>I believe what I need is makespan of times of individual threads, which can be different from the maximum CPU time used by any thread due to the task dependency structure among the threads. For example, in a process with 2 threads, thread 1 is heavily loaded in the first two-third of the runtime (for CPU time t) while thread 2 is loaded in the later two-third of the runtime of the process (again, for CPU time t). In this case: </p>

<ul>
<li>wall-clock time would return 3t/2 + context switch time + time used by other processes in between, </li>
<li>max CPU time of all threads would return a value close to t, and</li>
<li>total CPU time is close to 2t.</li>
<li>What I hope to receive as output of measure is the makespan, i.e., 3t/2. </li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, multi-threading brings indeterminacy on its own. This issue can probably be taken care of running the test multiple times and summarizing the results. </p>

<p>Moreover, the latency also depends on how the OS schedules the threads; things get more complicated if some threads of a process wait for CPU while others run. But lets forget about this.</p>

<p>Is there an efficient way to compute/approximate this makespan time? For providing code examples, please use any programming language, but preferably C or C++ on linux.</p>

<p>PS: I understand this definition of makespan is different from what is used in scheduling problems. The definition used in scheduling problems is similar to wall-clock time. </p>

<pre><code>$('#CHMap').gmap({
  mapTypeControl : false
}).bind('init', function(evt, map) {
  log(""Map initilised"");
});
</code></pre>

<p>Then elsewhere in script I'm using <a href=""http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/infobox/docs/reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">InfoBox</a> to add some style-able info boxes filled with data pulled back from from a geolocation service like so:</p>

<pre><code>var boxText = document.createElement(""div"");
var ib = new InfoBox(myOptions); //myOptions can be ignored for this example

$.each(data, function(name, value) {
  $('#CHMap').gmap('addMarker', {
    id:value['YourId'],
    'position': value['Latitude']+','+value['Longitude'],
    'bounds': true,
    'icon': '/img/gicon.png'
  }).click(function() {
    boxText.innerHTML = ""hello"";
    ib.setContent(boxText);
    ib.open(map, this);
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>'data' is an object returned from the Geolocation service. If I place the above 'addMarker' code inside the bound 'init' function when the gmap is first created, the infoBox displays fine. When I use the 'addMarker' code elsewhere, I get ""Uncaught ReferenceError: map is not defined"" error in console.</p>

<p>How can I reference the 'map' correctly? It looks like I cannot do <code>var map = $('#CHMap').gmap({//options});</code> as the 'jquery-ui-map' docs suggest that gmap returns nothing.</p>

<p>I currently don't make use of subdomains in my app, but this is going to change. What I want, is that when a subdomain is present in the host (<a href=""http://subdomain.foo.bar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://subdomain.foo.bar</a>), the router only matches routes if the route configuration has a subdomain in the host.</p>

<p><strong>This should match:</strong> (which it does)</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @Route(""/"", host=""{subdomain}.%host%"")
 * @Template
 */
public function index()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This should not match and return 404:</strong></p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @Route(""/"")
 * @Template
 */
public function index()
</code></pre>

<p>Because of the aforementioned indifference, this route is also matched for <a href=""http://subdomain.foo.bar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://subdomain.foo.bar</a></p>

<p>So what I want is to set the host requirement globally (foo.bar) and then specify for specific routes that they should also match when a subdomain is present.</p>

<p>I tried adding the host requirement to the import in <code>app/config/routing.yml</code>:</p>

<pre><code>foo:
    resource: ""@AcmeFooBundle/Controller/""
    type:     annotation
    host:     foo.bar
    prefix:   /
</code></pre>

<p>However, that host requirement ""wins"" from the ones specified in the annotation, resulting in no match for any of the two routes (mentioned above) when a subdomain is present in the actual host.</p>

<p>What does work is setting the host name globablly per controller:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @Route(host=""foo.bar"")
 */
class bazController
</code></pre>

<p>But I'd much rather configure this somewhere globally.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to solve this? </p>

<p>There is a point in my Model where user input is required before any further calculations can proceed. </p>

<p>Is there an elegant way I can request input from the controller without breaking MVC?</p>

<p>The only way I can think of doing this right now is just returning a value a nonzero value from the method in the model to the controller, and then having the control call a separate method to send the input to the model.</p>

<p>I was hoping there is some other way to pause the execution of the code in the model while it waits for input from the controller.</p>

<p>Here is some applicable code. I simplified most of it for readability.</p>

<p>Relevant ViewController function:</p>

<pre><code>@implementation GameViewController

-(void)tap:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)gesture
{
    if(gesture.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded) {
        id view = gesture.view;
        if ([view isKindOfClass:[GameBoardTileView class]]) {
            GameBoardTileView *gameTileView = (GameBoardTileView *) view;
            int row = gameTileView.row;
            int col = gameTileView.col;
            [self.game chooseTileAtRow:row column:col];

            // Updates states of all game tiles after tapping one tile               

            [self updateTiles];

        }
    }
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Relevant Model function:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)chooseTileAtRow:(int)row column:(int)col
{
    // Retrieves the game tile at the spot just selected

    GameBoardTile *tile = [self retrieveTileAtRow:row column:col];

     // Makes sure the spot is empty
    if (tile.companyType == -1) {

        // If no company type is found generate a random company type
        if (!tile.companyType) {
            //NSLog(@""changing company type"");

            if ([self.chainsInPlay count]) {

                /////////// Would like index to be given by the Controller instead of randomly generated
                int index = [self generateRandomNumber:0 end:[self.chainsInPlay count]-1];

                tile.companyType = [[self.chainsInPlay objectAtIndex:index] intValue];                        
                [self.chainsInPlay removeObjectAtIndex:index];
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What the view controller does is it keeps track of a grid of tiles that when an individual tile is tapped, it sends that row and column over to the Model using <code>chooseTileAtRow:column:</code>. The model retrieves a <code>GameBoardTile</code> at that row and column and gets the <code>companyType</code>. If the <code>companyType</code> does not exist (== 0), I would like it to be set. Currently it just generates a random number for testing purposes. Ideally, I would like this number to be passed in from the Controller and selected via user input.</p>

Because we did no know better, defined custom namespaces for our own extensions and articles with an id that is <strong>smaller than 3000</strong>. </p>

<p>For example: </p>

<pre><code>define('NS_bla', 1100);
$wgExtraNamespaces[NS_bla] = ""bla"";
define('NS_bla_TALK', 1101);
$wgExtraNamespaces[NS_bla_TALK] = ""bla Talk"";

<p>We did this with several different extensions. Now we read on the official documentation (<a href=""http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_default_namespaces"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_default_namespaces</a>) that custom namespaces <strong>should use id's that are 3000+</strong>. </p>

<p>Therefore my question: How can we easily <strong>change the IDs of the namespaces</strong> on the  production instance, without messing up with our current dataset? How could we tackle this problem? I could not find any information on the Mediawiki documentation.</p>

<p>If I use the same code of postTest() in a simple Java class which is not running on tomcat, i don't get an exception and the result is correct:</p>

<pre><code> 200
 Hello World :-) 
</code></pre>

<p>So i think the problem has to be somewhere in the Tomcat server. For me it looks like that the Jersey client I used in application #2 somehow escapes the servlet container. That's why I probably got all this NoClassDefErrors. But I'm not sure...</p>

<p>Does anybody has an idea what's going wrong here? 
<strong>Or is there maybe another approach how to make HTTP-Requests on a REST-resource from another REST-resource?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong>
The solution was to remove the jersey-client dependency like @peeskillet suggested.</p>

<li>Participant - foreignKey refering to Team - teamId</li>
<li>TeamResult- foreignKey refering to Team - teamId</li>

<p>Each team can have multiple participants so there can be multiple records in participant table having same teamId. Same case with team results.</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""id"": 1,
    ""teamName"": ""Awesome Team"",
    //other team attributes..

        }
    ]
}

<p>I have wrote the following statement but all I get is just first one of Participants and Mentors, not all of them:</p>

<pre><code>models.Team.find({

<pre><code>convertToExcel(GetTableCellsToDataSet()); creates the file so if I call that onClick of an asp:button it actually only displays the headers of the table (because the table gets recreated on postback).

<p>All of this code is attribute to a Server Behavior I've added. I now want to implement a cookie, so that the second time someone wants to login, the username is already filled out.
I've tried several methods of trying to add it, but none have worked.
When it test it, the cookie doesn't get created. If I change the name of the cookie to read an existing cookie, it does work. So somewhere the Login code prevents the cookie frome being created.</p>

When I delete Employee I want to delete all Users that are associated with Employee too. So for this purpose I've added cascade: ""all"". But I cannot delete User and don't delete Roles associated with him since I have many to many table. Right now I have a special code that does it. Maybe its somehow possible to do it with cascade in UserRole entity but for me it's no clear how because UserRole has pretty strange structure (but its defula one).

<p>Custom Control -> PersonPanel.xaml:</p>

    &lt;Label x:Name=""resultText"" Text=""{Binding ResultText}"" IsVisible=""{Binding ResultTextVisible}""/&gt;
  &lt;/StackLayout&gt;
&lt;/ContentView&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Code-Behind -> PersonPanel.xaml.cs:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class PersonPanel : ContentView

    public PersonPanel()

<p>Using of Control in another View:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?&gt;

  &lt;/StackLayout&gt;
&lt;/ContentPage&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using Autofac as the IOC Container.</p>

<p>What do you think about it? I am using MVVM the right way (it's very new to me)?</p>

<p>Is there a better way to deal with calling the Command from the Event (TextChanged) on the view?</p>

<p>What's about the properties in the Code-Behind (which do a routing to the ViewModel)?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
I'll try to describe, what I want to achieve:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating our own control (reusable in different views, cross-platform) -> PersonPanel.xaml</li>
<li>Written in XAML in our PCL Project with pure Xamarin.Forms controls in it</li>
<li>The control should have it's own commands (Search) and properties</li>
<li>One of the commands is using a Service</li>
<li>The control should get the Service (as an Interface) injected through IOC</li>
<li>The Service itself is also implemented in the PCL Project and makes a REST Call to a Webservice</li>
<li>The Result of the Call is than set to a property of the control -> ResultText Property</li>
<li>The Result is visible to the User</li>
</ul>

<p>-> With the above implementation, all of that works, but I'm not sure if this is the right way...</p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Kind regards,
Peter</p>

Those base Controls which I need to alter I set to 'protected' in the designer.  So I have another form, Main2, that derives from Main1.  Then I have another form, Main3, which has even more additions/alterations but needs the additions of the 2nd form.  And so forth.  My inheritance chain looks like:
MainX : Main(X - 1) : ... : Main2 : Main1</p>

<p>This works great and allows me to have designer support when moving around and resizing Controls, but I am always wary of inheritance in general and <em>especially</em> when I have a chain this big.</p>

<pre><code>int delete(node* head, int i)

<p>thus, unlike what other threads recommend to do, I cannot return a node or use **node in the parameters. printing the set before and after deleting outputs a 0 instead of the first node:</p>

<pre><code>//before
 12, 1, 14, 
//after
  0, 1, 14,

<p>The function is designed to delete any node, but I'm stuck on the part where the header's value is equal to i. Here is a code snippet from the function <code>delete</code> which deals with the first node:</p>

<pre><code>int delete(node * head, int i) {
   node * current;
   current=head;
   while (current){
       if((current=head) &amp;&amp; (head-&gt;value=i)){

<pre><code>angular.module(""app"", ['ui.bootstrap', 'ngRoute', 'ngGridPanel']).config(function($routeProvider) {
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see it has <code>ngGridPanel</code> included via dependency injection.</p>

<p>Here is the definition of <code>ngGridPanel</code>'s module/directive:</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('ngGridPanel', ['ngAnimate']).directive('gridPanel', ['$animate', '$compile', '$window', '$document', '$timeout', function ($animate, $compile, $window, $document, $timeout) {
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it refers to <code>ngAnimate</code>.</p>

<p>The problem I am having is that once I inject <code>ngGridPanel</code> into my app, every element in my app is suddenly attempting to be animated.</p>

<p>Now, as <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/8224"" rel=""nofollow"">described in this Angular.js GitHub issue</a>, <code>ngAnimate</code> will assume everything should be animated. Once I realized this is the expected behaviour, I realized that <strong>I never included ngAnimate into my app module in the first place</strong>. </p>

<p>So why would it be affecting my entire application? Shouldn't it only take effect in the directive that belongs to the <code>ngGridPanel</code> module?</p>

<p>So how is <code>ngAnimate</code> affecting the parent module scope? Is this normal?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Side-note:</strong> At this point I haven't even utilized the <code>ngGridPanel</code> directive at all. I have merely injected it into my app.</p>

<p><strong>Side-note 2:</strong> Once I implemented a class name filter (<code>$animateProvider.classNameFilter(/enable-animate/);</code>) in my app, animations stopped on all my elements but remained working in the <code>ngGridPanel</code> directive <em>without having to add the <code>enable-animate</code> class anywhere</em>.</p>

<p>Do SQL Queries Need to be that Complicated?</p>

<p>From a Web Dev point of view, as C#/.Net progresses, it seems that there are plenty of easy ways (LINQ, Generics) to do a lot of the things that some people tend to do in their SQL queries (sorting, ordering, merging, etc). That being said, since SQL tends to be the processing ""bottleneck"" for a lot of apps, a lot of the logic for SQL queries is being moved to the business layer.</p>

<p>As this trend continues, I'm seeing less of a need for large SQL queries. </p>

<p>What do you all think? Are you still writing large SQL queries? If so, is it because you need to or because you are more comfortable doing so than working in the business layer?</p>

<p>This all makes sense but how do I merge 2 capture instances after a DDL change? Also, would you increase the retention time of CDC from the default 3 days or how would you keep a complete audit trail of changes indefinitely?</p>

My problem is when I try to store the values of my data using the <code>characters()</code> method. I am creating an object where for each element I store each value and some extra information for some later use but when I try to store said value it stores spaces instead. I tried printing inside the method and while it seams to go through all my xml file it prints only a couple of the elements and not even in the right order. So can someone explain me what I am missing?</p>

<p>We can remotely access the DB via the credentials in the ConnectionStringToRemoteDB1 just fine.  We are told that the 'MembershipProviderService.MembershipService' and associated APIs are designed to go and get the Remote Address from the Database and serve it up to the Membership Provider.</p>

<p>Does anybody see any issues with the configuration in here that screams that this would not work?
This feels like there is a config piece missing, but consuming services across domains by way of VPN makes it difficult to know what the issue might be.  Thanks for any suggestions in advance!</p>

I'm also using javascript tabs in my web app so by 'not visible' I mean that it is on a different tab. I've set up a jsfiddle to demonstrate the behavior:</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/35kU5/10/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/35kU5/10/</a></p>

<p>If you click the <strong>Add</strong> button while you are on the tab that contains the calendar, the events will be added and immediately visible.</p>

<p>However, if you click the <strong>Add</strong> button while you are on the second (empty) tab, then switch back to the first tab with the calendar, the 'added' events are not there until you force the calendar to repaint them by some action such as switching the view from <em>week</em> to <em>month</em>, or switching days/weeks/months, then going back.</p>

<p>I've tried the </p>

<pre><code>$(""#calendar"").fullcalendar('refetchEvents');
$(""#calendar"").fullcalendar('rerenderEvents');
</code></pre>

<p>methods, neither of these solve the issue....Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong here? Or is this simply not possible?</p>

works on a class that is defined in another namespace and the operator should get
access to the private members of that class. The problem I have is that I don't
know how to scope that global operator when making it a friend in the class definition.</p>

<p>I tried something like:</p>

<pre><code>namespace NAME
{
    class A {
        public:
            friend A ::operator * (double lhs, const A&amp; rhs);
        private:
            int private_var;
    };
}

A operator * (double lhs, const A&amp; rhs)
{
    double x = rhs.private_var;
    ...
}

<p>The compiler (g++ 4.4) didn't know what to do with it. It seems that the line</p>

<pre><code>friend A ::operator * ()
</code></pre>

<p>is evaluated as something like (pseudo-code)</p>

<pre><code>(A::operator)
</code></pre>

<p>instead of </p>

<pre><code>(A) (::operator)
</code></pre>

<p>If I leave out the :: in the declaration of the operator the compiling works but the operator is then in namespace NAME and not in the global namespace.</p>

<p>The part i'm trying to get my head around is the logging in/out on the website and keeping the user logged in across pages. Since in a true REST implementation there's no state held on the server, i can't use $_SESSION and now i don't know where to start!</p>

At runtime, it walks the XML nodes and converts it. Glorified node to node converter but not efficient and has a performance barrier that we cannot overcome. The good part is that it writes a definition file that lists inbound XML elements and its corresponding conversion names. I would like to write a tool in .NET, that would read this definition file and auto-generates a XSLT with it. Once it generates the XSLT, I can compile it using XSLTC and include it using reflection in my Web apps for runtime conversions. Any ideas, guidance, suggestions or tools available to make this happen is much appreciated</p>

<p>And I set its SRID to 27700 when I upload it using the PostGIS shapefile uploader. </p>

<p>In PG Admin, when I ask:</p>

<pre><code>select st_srid(geom) from counties limit 1;
select st_srid(longlat) from colic limit 1;
</code></pre>

<p>I get 27700 for both. </p>

<p>But...when I try any spatial query I get no response, and when I load the layers into quantum, the point data are off the tip of Cornwall in the north Atlantic, and only represented as one dot on the scale of the counties map.If I zoom in on them, they are 'there', but just not in east anglia where they should be!</p>

<p>This is my first attempt at both  SQL and mapping - I'm sure there is something really simple that I have missed.</p>

<p>I have an app that is in the store that uses in app sound. Currently I am using AVQueuePlayer because some of the sound will overlap and allow it to play in order. A lot of this sound is being played while I am playing embedded videos using AVPlayer which may not matter at all. The problem is that I am having reports of the sound stopping across the entire app. I am unable to reproduce this myself but we have a lot of active users and it is reported by some. Whenever it is reported and we determine its not just the silent switch or the sound volume down restarting the app always solves the problem. Occasionally we've heard of the sound magically returning with no changes. I have also had a couple of reports that it happens when using airplay and bluetooth but that may just be an complication of the problem or coincidence.</p>

<p>Below is the code that I am using and maybe I'm just using a setting wrong or not using a setting that I should be but this code works 99.9% of the time. </p>

<p>I use ducking for all sounds I play to lower the volume of the user's iPod music.</p>

<p>Here is my initialization in appDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions (Maybe its not needed at all in the start and sorry for the mixing of conventions):</p>

<pre><code>AudioSessionInitialize (NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

    [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback error:nil];

    UInt32 sessionCategory = kAudioSessionCategory_AmbientSound;
    AudioSessionSetProperty (kAudioSessionProperty_AudioCategory, sizeof (sessionCategory), &amp;sessionCategory);

    [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setActive:YES withFlags:AVAudioSessionSetActiveFlags_NotifyOthersOnDeactivation error:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>When I play a sound:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)playSound: (NSString *)soundString
{
    OSStatus propertySetError = 0;
    UInt32 allowMixing = true;
    propertySetError |= AudioSessionSetProperty(kAudioSessionProperty_OtherMixableAudioShouldDuck, sizeof(allowMixing), &amp;allowMixing);

    [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setActive:YES withFlags:AVAudioSessionSetActiveFlags_NotifyOthersOnDeactivation error:nil];

    NSURL *thisUrl = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@/%@.caf"", [[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath], soundString]];

    AVPlayerItem *item = [[AVPlayerItem alloc] initWithURL:thisUrl];

    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
                                             selector:@selector(reachedEndOfItem:)
                                                 name:AVPlayerItemDidPlayToEndTimeNotification
                                               object:item];

    if(_audioPlayerQueue == nil)
    {
        _audioPlayerQueue = [[AVQueuePlayer alloc] initWithItems:[NSArray arrayWithObject:item]];
    }
    else
    {
        if([_audioPlayerQueue canInsertItem:item afterItem:nil])
        {
            [_audioPlayerQueue insertItem:item afterItem:nil];
        }
    }

    if(_audioPlayerQueue == nil)
    {
        NSLog(@""error"");
    }
    else
    {
        [_audioPlayerQueue play];
    }

    return;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the sound finishes playing:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)reachedEndOfItem: (AVPlayerItem*)item
{
    [self performSelector:@selector(turnOffDucking) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.5f];
}

- (void)turnOffDucking
{
    NSLog(@""reached end"");

    [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setActive:NO withFlags:AVAudioSessionSetActiveFlags_NotifyOthersOnDeactivation error:nil];

    OSStatus propertySetError = 0;
    UInt32 allowMixing = false;
    propertySetError |= AudioSessionSetProperty(kAudioSessionProperty_OtherMixableAudioShouldDuck, sizeof(allowMixing), &amp;allowMixing);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any insight on what I am doing wrong, what settings I should be using for the audio session or known bugs/problems would be very helpful. I would be willing to look into using a different audio engine as this can have some slight performance issues when playing a video and having iPod music playing in tandem but I'd rather stick with this method of playing audio.</p>

<p>Thank you for any help you can provide.</p>

<p>JS FIDDLE: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/2xrUK/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/2xrUK/</a></p>

<p><strong>Opera, Firefox, Chrome</strong>: loads both audio elements.</p>

<p><strong>Safari</strong>: Not tested. Don't own a Mac.</p>

<p><strong>Internet Explorer 11</strong>: loads the first one <code>#asmpg</code> fine, but cannot load the audio from <code>g-liu.com</code>. In the console, I get the message,</p>

<p><code>MEDIA12899: AUDIO/VIDEO: Unknown MIME type.</code></p>

<p>The other browsers do not have this issue, and can play the audio fine. At this point, it is beyond me why IE cannot retrieve the audio from <code>g-liu.com</code>. It tells me that it's encountering an unknown MIME Type but I did specify it in the <code>source</code> tag. Perhaps it's the way that the data is sent to the web page?</p>

<p><em>(Side note: For debugging purposes, this is a simplification of what I'm trying to do. In actual development, I am loading the audio asynchronously, and having audio play/pause when user clicks a button.)</em></p>

What I am trying to do is when a user clicks on the cancel button of a form the data displayed should go back to its original state.  To do this I am using a JavaScript object that holds the original information and then using angular.copy() to copy the original information to $scope variable for display.</p>

<p>The code that is saving the information.</p>

<pre><code>getInfo.getMoreInformation(""/views/people/"" + $scope.vendorguid +""/payroll-details"").success(function(data, status, headers, config){


            dataOracle = data.data['oracle-user'];

            $scope.oracle = data.data['oracle-user'];

<pre><code>$scope.orcancel = function(){

    $scope.oracle = {};

    angular.copy(dataOracle, $scope.oracle);

}

<p>What is happening is that when the user makes a change in the form on the HTML page, the variable dataOracle is being changed.  So when the copy is executed the new entered data is passed to $scope.oracle.  I have used the same process on other pages and it works as expected, but on this page it is not working properly.</p>

Basically when my c# .NET application shuts down, I want to remove the running Java process that it created. The initial problem was that I was trying to save processID to a static class member variable (which obviously didnt work). I found a Global Class example online and used that instead, however it still isn't shutting down the process.</p>

<p>Debugging it isn't working properly. I guess it just creates a new instance of the application rather than running the one that I built, and even setting the working directory to the ""Bin"" directory doesn't work. So I am just having to run my .exe from the Bin directory at the moment.</p>

<p>I'm trying to figure out the best way to do this. I can create a configuration using the node.js sdk that I can use to make a second environment, or use the eb CLI tool make a clone. But I don't know what resources these cover - for instance, if I specify a multi-server environment from 2 to 4 servers, it'll start with 2. If the load increases to the point where we have 3 servers running, and I use clone or create a configuration, I believe that the new environment is only going to have two servers. Also, not sure about changes we make to alarms and security groups.</p>

<p>Anyone done this, and found a good way to do it? I'm pretty sure I can just slog through each type of resource, retrieving what's already there and adding them to the create scripts. But that's fairly complex.</p>

<p>We have considered using the rolling update of what's in place, reusing the environment that is there. This is relatively easy, as it leaves everything as is, just updates the code. But then we have to manage what is going on with the data as some folks come in with the new code, and some come in with the old.</p>

<pre><code>The method notifyDataSetChanged(View) is undefined for the type ListView
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Om5RD.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>My listview is set originally at the top of my code with just a:</p>

<pre><code>ListView listView;
</code></pre>

<p>It's then set in a routine on the onload</p>

<pre><code>public void loadItems(){
    //Removed - just getting the data

     int rowCount;       
     rowCount = mCategory.size();

     listView = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.lvItems);


     int[] colors = {0, 0xFFFF0000, 0}; 
     listView.setDivider(new GradientDrawable(Orientation.RIGHT_LEFT, colors));
     listView.setDividerHeight(1);
     listView.setAdapter(new CustomAdapter());

     listView.setClickable(true);
     listView.setOnItemClickListener(new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {

       @Override
       public void onItemClick(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; arg0, View arg1, int position, long arg3) {

          loadPopup(mDescription.get(position).toString(), mCountList.get(position).toString(), mTemplatecode.get(position).toString());
       }
     });
     //Removed - Tidying up
}
</code></pre>

<p>The dialog box that is loaded on the onlick has a simple interface, a minus button, a plus button, a text box and a go button. The number in the textbox is changed which does a db call. When the dialog box closes I want it to refresh the listview behind to reflect the new change. I.e. basically re-run the loadItems() routine again.</p>

<p>This is what happens when you click the go button on the dialog. I'm obviously putting the notifyDataSetChanged in the wrong place as it wont even run.</p>

<pre><code> btnGo.setOnClickListener( new View.OnClickListener(){
        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
            addAsset(v, AssetDesc, txt.getText().toString(), templateCode);
            listView.notifyDataSetChanged();
            loadItems();
            dialog.dismiss();
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Custom adapter:</p>

<pre><code>class CustomAdapter extends BaseAdapter
    {

    @Override
    public int getCount() {

        return mDescription.size();
    }
@Override

    return null;
}

@Override
public long getItemId(int arg0) {

    return 0;

<p>Its a simple 2d platformer from an overhead view. The app consists of Several scenes, including the Menus, Quit screen, Loading screen, tutorial and of course the game itself.</p>

<p>The game has randomly generating obstacles that must be avoided (similar to Temple Run)</p>

<p>I have attempted to use classes, but really most of the coding is on the main frames.</p>

<p>Most textures will be graphic and i have several tracks to accompany the game.</p>

<p>I am a very new programmer and have only grasped the basics. after testing the app on several devices, i was unable to manage to get the app working on a single one.</p>

<p>I am also concerned about the fact that adobe air is required for anyone to use my app.</p>

<p>I really would like to avoid using another language, unless a translation is simple or if I have no other choice.</p>

<p>I would greatly appreciate if someone could guide me through this situation.
i have also purposely not included any code, however, if someone would as kind to help me translate it, i would be happy to post it. </p>

<p>Thanks guys for the comments, i will look out for and work on classes and object based</p>

<p>Also, if someone was to wonder on this question, it actually based on ""software tools commonly used by programmers""

Now in my front end there is a textbox to filter out the users from this table. Let's suppose I am taking that input from the front end in the form of a input parameter ""@SEARCHKEYWORD"". I have created a sample below:</p>

<pre><code>
DECLARE @Test TABLE

SELECT 'Peter','Smith' UNION ALL
SELECT 'Dave','Smith' UNION ALL
SELECT 'Girija','Acharya'  UNION ALL
SELECT  'Devendra', 'Gujel' UNION ALL
SELECT 'Arjit', 'Gupta'

DECLARE @SEARCHKEYWORD NVARCHAR(100)

SELECT * FROM @Test WHERE FNAME +' '+ LNAME LIKE @SEARCHKEYWORD

<p>i.e. so far I have thought of this query to filter out the rows but it is not giving the desired results:
<code><pre> 
SELECT * FROM @Test WHERE FNAME +' '+ LNAME LIKE @SEARCHKEYWORD

<p>Here are the desired outputs which I needed for the inputs mentioned below:
<code><pre></p>

<p>--WHEN  @SEARCHKEYWORD='John Resig'
--Desired OUTPUT: the row which contains 'John','Resig' </p>

<p>--WHEN  @SEARCHKEYWORD='Ac'
--Desired OUTPUT: the row which contains 'Girija','Acharya' </p>

<p>--WHEN  @SEARCHKEYWORD='Smith'
--Desired OUTPUT: the row which contains 'Peter','Smith' and 'Dave','Smith'</p>

<p>--WHEN  @SEARCHKEYWORD='g'

<p>The DTD for this XML file is fairly simple. It's basically a bunch of key-value pairs, with support for arrays as well.</p>

<p>I've found XML parsers like Mini-XML and AsmXml, but they don't seem to support building a linked-list of the XML file based on the DTD. Is there an XML parsing library available that can read a DTD, and then convert the XML data into a linked list that I can easily search, access, etc?</p>

<p>Since this XML file is a bunch of key-value pairs, I'd like the XML parser to read the XML file, put it into a linked list, and then allow me to do something like <code>xml_lookup_key(xml_data, ""Name"")</code>, which would return something like <i>John Doe</i>, or <code>xml_lookup_key(xml_data, ""lastNames"")</code> which would return a linked list of last names.</p>

"31058241","1","","","2015-06-25 18:39:55","","0","32","<p>I am starting an image processing project in R and am looking for advice concerning data storage and organization.  My goal is to have one or several .RData files that contain information on several thousands of images.  </p>

<p>Let me back up, I have a directory of tiff files created from converting a mp4 video into its subsequent frames.  These tiff files are named <code>0001.tiff, 0002.tiff, 0003.tiff, ...</code>  Also within this directory I have tiff files created from cropping a certain region from the original frames.  These are called <code>c_0001.tiff, c_0002.tiff, ...</code>.  Similarly there are other tiff files that are <strong>altered</strong> from the original frames.  For example, there are tiff files corresponding to a gray-scaled version of the cropped tiffs.  These gray scaled, cropped tiffs are called <code>g_c_0001.tiff, g_c_002.tiff, ...</code>.  There are several other tiff categories (similar to the cropped and gray scaled) but those mentioned above are enough to illustrate my question.  </p>

<p>I am hoping to create an efficient and simple dataset to contain all these tiff files as matrices and output them in a compressed format.  </p>

<p>My initial thoughts were to: </p>

<p>1.) Create one lists for every frame that represented all the <strong>altered</strong> tiff files as matrices for that frame. Something like</p>

<pre><code>frame1 = list(readTIFF('0001.tiff'),readTIFF('c_0001.tiff'),readTIFF('g_c_0001.tiff')
frame2 = list(readTIFF('0002.tiff'),readTIFF('c_0002.tiff'),readTIFF('g_c_0002.tiff')
frame3 = list(readTIFF('0003.tiff'),readTIFF('c_0003.tiff'),readTIFF('g_c_0003.tiff')
</code></pre>

<p>2.) Add each of the above lists to a single list representing, say, an hours worth of frames</p>

<pre><code>hr = list(frame1, frame2, frame3)
</code></pre>

<p>3.) Save this hours worth of data as a compressed RData file or similar binary format.   </p>

<p>And FINALLY to my question.  Do any of you R superheros have any suggestions or comments regarding this structure?  I have looked around and found that people generally disapprove of lists unless necessary.  Also accessing the nested lists seems to be a bit tricky -- having to use unlist() and the like.  My experience with large datasets (> 1 gigabyte) is limited so I can use all the help/advice I can get.  Cheers!  </p>

<p>p.s. let me know if anything else needs clarifying or if more information is needed to answer.  </p>

<p>Today, when I opened uTorrent and looked up for file association, I've found that you can enable (writing to registry) without any confirmation from the UAC.</p>

<p>How is that possible? uTorrent is not running as an admin.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Well, I have just discovered with <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Process Monitor</a> (Sysinternals) that what uTorrent.exe does is to create a few keys (<strong>uTorrent</strong> and <strong>.torrent</strong>) but in <strong>HKCU</strong> (<code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code>), not in <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</code>.
Anyways I also have those keys in <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</code> ... maybe the installer created those. Not sure.</p>

<pre><code>ID Name  OrderNumber Shipped

<p>So by default it is sorted in ASC order by name when you first arrive at the page, but now.. if the User resorts it by clicking on the Name heading again it will make it in DESC order. So what I am being asked to do is to make the web remember the sorting option no matter if the user navigates to a different page within the application.  So when the user comes back he should see the gridview in the order he/she picked before leaving to another page within the appliacation.</p>

<p>How can I do this with a RadGrid, without using <code>HttpCookie</code> ?</p>

<p>I do not think I should show my code as it is the plain default set up of a RadGrid BUT if necessary I will just grab something and put it here, I am just not sure the best way to go about it.</p>

<p>I am using VS 2013 Professional with a webforms application with c# behind.</p>

<p>I want to be able to read/write GUID coded images to a specified directory, outside of asp.net as I don't want to keep track of the files in visual studio just verify their existence in the program.</p>

<p>I'd prefer to not store them inside the database as the amount of data will become costly as db storage is expensive vs. disk space.</p>

<p>I want the directory to be able to store images and display on command. I don't want any execution to be allowed in those directories.</p>

<p>The errors I get are access denied after creating the directories in WS-FTP with appropriate permissions inside the project area or unable to locate resource E:\blah\blah\UserData\LocImg. I also don't want to statically call out E:\blah\blah.....</p>

<p>If I create the directories in VS they don't ""publish"" and I'm concerned as I also don't want publishing to erase any existing data in the directories. If I create directories above wwwroot inside the project area using WS-FTP, they are removed during publishing.</p>

<p><strong>joke.html</strong></p>

<pre><code>{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block header_text %}{{ joke.title }}{% endblock %}

{% block text %}{{ joke.text }}{% endblock %}
</code></pre>

<p>What I want is that URLs that end like <strong>jokes/1/</strong> to render a page with the right html using joke.html. Instead, it renders a page without CSS or with joke.title and joke.text Also, I noticed that jokes/1/ doesn't find anything:</p>

<pre><code>DoesNotExist at /jokes/1/

Joke matching query does not exist.. 
</code></pre>

<p>I had 20 jokes in the database and I can find jokes/2/ through jokes/21/, which means their ids have shifted? :P
Can someone experienced with Django point out my(many, without a doubt) mistakes? Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Edit: second urls.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', jokes_views.home_page, name='home'),
    url(r'^jokes/', include(jokes_urls)),
    url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),

Everything is working fine so far.</p>

<p>But I have one problem, and I dont know why it is like that.</p>

<p>The menu is an UIViewController.
It contains 2 childViewControllers:<br>
- menuViewController<br>
- contentViewController</p>

<p>And it also contains 2 subViews:<br>
- menuView<br>
- contentView</p>

<p>The contentView is moved to the side like this to show the menu:</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>CATransform3D contentTransform = CATransform3DIdentity;
contentTransform.m34 = 1.0 / 500;
contentTransform = CATransform3DRotate(contentTransform, 0, 0, 1, 0);
contentTransform = CATransform3DTranslate(contentTransform, 0, 0, 0);
contentTransform = CATransform3DScale(contentTransform, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
self.contentViewContainer.layer.transform = contentTransform;
</code></pre>

<p>A new contentController is loaded by storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier and it will be brought to front:</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>- (void)bringControllerToFront:(UINavigationController *)controller {
    if (!controller) return;

    // remove the old contentViewController
    if (self.contentViewController.parentViewController) {
        [self.contentViewController.view removeFromSuperview];
        [self.contentViewController removeFromParentViewController];
    }

    // set the new contentViewController
    self.contentViewController = controller;

    [self addChildViewController:self.contentViewController];
    [self.contentViewContainer addSubview:self.contentViewController.view];
    [self.contentViewController didMoveToParentViewController:self];
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is how the contentView is brought back to front:</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>// Bring ContentViewContainer back to front
CATransform3D contentTransform = CATransform3DIdentity;
contentTransform.m34 = 1.0 / 500;
contentTransform = CATransform3DRotate(contentTransform, 0, 0, 1, 0);
contentTransform = CATransform3DTranslate(contentTransform, 0, 0, 0);
contentTransform = CATransform3DScale(contentTransform, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
self.contentViewContainer.layer.transform = contentTransform;
</code></pre>

<p>This is what happens, if the user clicks on a row:<br>
- controller for this row will be loaded<br>
- bringControllerToFront is called<br>
- containerView will be brought back to front  </p>

<p>Like this everything works fine.</p>

<p>If the user is scrolling through the sections, a preview for the current controller in each section is loaded.<br>
But at this preview, the containerView is not considering the status bar.<br>
So if the user touches the contentView, only the transform is called without bringControllerToFront and the contentview is under the status bar.  </p>

<p>So the problem is, that the status bar is not considered when a new preview/contentController is loaded.</p>

<p>Does anybody have a clue why?</p>

<p>Most of the time the issue is that the user did not specificy the package if the class is in package. However I made sure that my case is different. </p>

<p>I tried the following</p>

<p>1- I made sure that the all the java files of the project are in the same folder (4 java files one with main class)</p>

<p>2- I made sure that non of the classes are in any packages</p>

<p>Then I tried to run the program as following (It is a storm hello-world example in case you are familiar with it)</p>

<p>1- Compile using the following command (The jar is needed for storm)</p>

<pre><code>javac -classpath ~/Public/apache-storm-0.9.4/lib/storm-core-0.9.4.jar *.java
</code></pre>

<p>2- Run Main class using the following command (The jar is also needed here otherwise I'll get another error)</p>

<pre><code>java -cp ~/Public/apache-storm-0.9.4/lib/storm-core-0.9.4.jar HelloStorm

<p>I double checked that HelloStorm is the name of the main class (with no spelling mistakes)</p>

While implementing the selection handling I noticed that there is a difference in the behavior of the selection and highlighting handling between iPhone and iPad (tested it on the device as well on the simulator all running iOS 8.3).</p>

<p>Starting from a state, where one cell is already selected (and the table view only allows single selection). Cell A is the selected cell and Cell B is the new cell that will be selected.</p>

<p>On iPhone:</p>

<ul>
<li>Touch down:
<ul>
<li>Cell B -> set highlighted to YES</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Touch up:
<ul>
<li>Cell B -> set highlighted to NO</li>
<li>Cell A -> set selected to NO</li>
<li>Cell B -> set selected to YES</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>On iPad:</p>

<ul>
<li>Touch down:
<ul>
<li>Cell B -> set highlighted to YES</li>
<li>Cell A -> set selected to NO</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Touch up:
<ul>
<li>Cell B -> set highlighted to NO</li>
<li>Cell B -> set selected to YES</li>
<li>Cell B -> set selected to YES</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The result is, that on the iPhone the currently selected cell stays selected until the touch ends. On the iPad the currently selected cell get unselected during the touch.</p>

<p>Does anybody know, if this behavior is expected or if it might be a bug?</p>

<p>I know there is no solution as elegant as this in Delphi and I saw a lot of discussion about no being able to correctly hide the constructor in Delphi (make it private) so we would need to override the NewInstance and FreeInstrance methods.

<pre><code>type
TTestClass = class
private
  class var FInstance: TTestClass;

  class function GetInstance: TTestClass;
  class destructor DestroyClass;
end;

{ TTestClass }
class destructor TTestClass.DestroyClass;
begin
  if Assigned(FInstance) then
  FInstance.Free;
end;

class function TTestClass.GetInstance: TTestClass;
begin
  if not Assigned(FInstance) then
  FInstance := TTestClass.Create;
  Result := FInstance;
end;

    screen.blit(pygame.image.load(os.path.join('Images',item.name+'.png')), (100, 100))
</code></pre>

<p>I want to update the tuple (100,100) so that each new image gets printed to the right of the previous image.</p>

<p>What's the simplest way to accomplish this?</p>

<p>I started creating an app some time ago and using 'Create new Android Activity' usually created a .java and .xml file for it, and everything worked. Now, after update when I use 'Create new Android Activity' it creates .java with class (which now extends ActionBarActivity and not Activity as before) and it adds a fragment_nameofactivity.xml + all things to make it work like internal class extending Fragment... </p>

<p>Now I used to do some ListView display on the page and without a fragment it all works great, but when fragment got introduced I can no longer findViewById(R.id.list_view) if its inside a fragment... </p>

<p>My question is do I need to place my whole functionality inside the class extending Fragment? I tried but it didn't work... Or do I still write all my functionality in the original class and then somehow access the listView in the fragment... </p>

<p>Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>public class PlayersActivity extends ActionBarActivity {

        getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
                .add(R.id.container, new PlaceholderFragment()).commit();
    }

    playerDataHelper = new PlayerDataDatabaseAdapter(this);
    playerDataHelper.open();

    displayPlayersList();
}

@Override
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {

    // Inflate the menu; this adds items to the action bar if it is present.
    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.players, menu);
    return true;
}

@Override
public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
    // Handle action bar item clicks here. The action bar will
    // automatically handle clicks on the Home/Up button, so long
    // as you specify a parent activity in AndroidManifest.xml.
    int id = item.getItemId();
    if (id == R.id.action_settings) {
        return true;

Here's how the collision detection works; there's an invisible grid, and objects (or, rather, their references) are added and removed from cells based on where they are.  Collision comparisons are only done between objects in the same cell.</p>

<p>The references are stored in a Python <code>set</code> that is owned by each cell.  It has to be a set.  When a collision is detected, it's stored in a <code>Collision</code> object with three attributes; the two objects that collided and the time the collision occurred.  When all collisions are accounted for, they're sorted by time, then processed.</p>

<p>This is the loop that individual cells use to check for collisions;</p>

<pre><code>#grid.collisions is a list of recorded collisions, and self.objects is the set
#of objects currently in this cell.

for i in self.objects:
    for j in self.objects:
        if id(i) != id(j) and pygame.sprite.collide_rect(i, j):
            grid.collisions.append(Collision(i, j))
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, this compares the same two objects twice; if we had a set <code>{1, 2, 3, 4}</code>, we'd be comparing <code>(1, 2)</code> <em>and</em> <code>(2, 1)</code>.  Not only that, but these duplicate comparisons are being added into the total list of collisions and thereby breaking the entire system!</p>

<p>I know that I can't index sets, which means I can't do something like <code>for j in range(i, len(self.objects))</code> where <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are both integers.  <strong>How can I get around this limitation to make sure that two objects in the same set are not compared twice?</strong>  I can't remove the objects in these sets; they are only to be removed if the object leaves the grid cell.</p>

<p>Since these collisions are being handled every frame, I would prefer to avoid creating new objects (the real code doesn't create new <code>Collisions</code> as the sample does, I just simplified it for readability).  I <em>could</em> just remove duplicate comparisons, but to compare every collision to every other would be a lot of overhead.</p>

<p>I've been trying to learn TDD and have been following the 'By Example' book by Kent Beck; it's very good!</p>

<p>However, I can't seem progress because a value is returning null when I access a hashtable.  I've run a debug session and the object with the value is clearly there yet the result is null.</p>

<p>The code to build and access is:</p>

<pre><code>public void addRate(String from, String to, int rate){
    this.rates.put(new Pair(from, to), new Integer(rate));
}
</code></pre>

<p>from and to are ""GBP"" and ""USD"".  Also verified by debug.</p>

<p>Test case calling the above: </p>

<pre><code>@Test
public void testreduceMoneyDifferentCurrency(){
    Bank bank = new Bank();
    bank.addRate(""GBP"", ""USD"", 2);
    Money result = bank.reduce(Money.gbpound(2), ""USD"");
    assertEquals(Money.dollar(1), result);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The reduce method in bank calls the method rate:</p>

<pre><code>public Money reduce(Bank bank, String to){
    int rate = bank.rate(this.currency, to);
    return new Money(this.amount / rate, to);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which is where the issue is:</p>

<pre><code>    public int rate(String from, String to){
    if (from.equals(to)) return 1;
    Integer rate = (Integer) this.rates.get(new Pair(from, to));
    return rate.intValue();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first line copes with USD -> USD conversions etc.  </p>

<p>The Pair object is 2 strings built to be used as a key.  </p>

<p>I've not used has tables a great deal but I can't see what the issue is, I know for certain that the values are in the hashtable but 'rate' is always returning a null value.</p>

<p>I can't see the wood for the trees. :)  Could someone point me in the right direction please?</p>

<li><p>The procedure runs without issue when executed <em>manually</em></p></li>
<li><p>I have checked permission issues, and that doesn't seem to be the problem. The agent runs under my own account and I am a sysadmin on the database</p></li>

<li><p>When the query is run separately through SQL Server Agent it gives a slightly different error. This leads me to believe it is an encoding issue. However I am getting the XML from a webpage and I can't change the encoding on the webpage.</p></li>

<p>Edit1: Thank you so much for your help. I had to take a little time away from the problem to clear my head. Back at it this week.</p>

<p>Ok I think I've finally figured out the root of the problem. This is the code I am using to take the data from the website. It is truncating the data being pulled from the website. It runs perfectly when executed in SSMS. It truncated the data to 2048 characters when run through a batch file and truncates the data to 512 characters when run using a SS Job.</p>

<p>These values can not be random. There must be a setting somewhere but I can't find it. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Here's the code:</p>

@win integer,

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT ON (city, airport, zip, country, name) city, airport, price, id FROM mytable;
</code></pre>

<p>The spring-batch reader definition:</p>

<pre><code>JpaPagingItemReader&lt;MyEntity&gt; reader;
reader.setPageSize(PAGE_SIZE);
</code></pre>

<p>If I define the <code>PAGE_SIZE</code> to be as large as the database columns, the performance is equal to 12 sec.
But if I set the size to a lower value (eg pagesize = 100.000 on a 1.000.000 datarows db), the performance is very bad (~ 10x as long).</p>

<p>Spring-batch applies specific pagination on the queries in the background. What is does:</p>

<pre><code>query.setFirstResult();
query.setMaxResult();
</code></pre>

<p>if page size is 10, den the queries executed are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    firstResult, maxResult
    0, 10
   10, 10
   20, 10
   30, 10...
</code></pre>

<p>This again translates to <code>LIMIT</code> and <code>OFFSET</code> in SQL.</p>

<p>Question: is a <code>SELECT DISTINCT ON</code> not combinable with pagination LIMIT/OFFSET? To me it seems as if the full select distinct query is executed again on each ""pagination"" run, and thus lasts very long.</p>

<p>So, if the database must anyhow make a full distinct select before applying the maxresults, can I temporary save the ""distinct"" select and just fetch the next page?</p>

<p>How can I improve this, without having to set the pagination size to 1million. Or is improvement not possible here?</p>

<p>It does not seem ideal since I am passing to MyObject much more (the view controller itself) than it should need, but it is certainly quick and functional.  If there is a cleaner approach, such as relying on protocols, that is also succinct, a brief code sample would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>I have been looking into php and sql for two weeks now, and I don't have a programming background. So please forgive my ignorance. I'm sure I've made lot's of mistakes.</p>

<p>Let me explain my situation further.</p>

<p>I created a web page so a admin can fill in some data concerning some game. This is after a login process.
When a admin arrives at this point, I'm not bothering with 'correct' input at the moment. I just want to get the data in the db.</p>

<p>I created a table called <code>games</code> with mysql, and filled it with data I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>+--------+--------+-----+-----+------+------+------+
|game_id |round_id|team1|team2|score1|score2|result| 
+--------+--------+-----+-----+------+------+------+
| 1      | 1      | A   | B   | NULL | NULL | NULL |
| 2      | 1      | C   | D   | NULL | NULL | NULL |
| 3      | 1      | E   | F   | NULL | NULL | NULL |
| 4      | 2      | E   | C   | NULL | NULL | NULL |
| 5      | 2      | A   | D   | NULL | NULL | NULL |
| 6      | 2      | F   | B   | NULL | NULL | NULL |
+--------+--------+-----+-----+------+------+------+
</code></pre>

<p>Then I created a form in a php page which uses data from this table to display the teams per game. </p>

<p>The admin uses this form to fill in the game score and results.  See the form below.This form is also needed to store values in the above table.</p>

<p><code>input.php</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

mysql_connect(""xxx"", ""xxx"", ""xxx"") or die(mysql_error()); 
mysql_select_db(""xxx"") or die(mysql_error()); 

$query=""SELECT games_team1, games_team2 FROM games WHERE round_id = 1"";

$result = mysql_query($query);

<p>This results into 3 rows in the table in the form above. This table displays the teams for each match and input fields for the scores and the result. 
A header, three rows with the games, input fields behind the games, and a sumbit button below.</p>

<p>A admin can submit the input with the form below. I added the echo so I can check if the output is correct. The echo works like a charm. 
This is where things don't go the way I'd like them to go. The sql query I used is stated in the form. It fails miserably, probably because of my lack of knowledge. </p>

<p><code>form1.php</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

mysql_select_db(""xxx"") or die(mysql_error()); 

$sc1 = $_POST['score1'];
$sc2 = $_POST['score2'];
$res = $_POST['result'];

    echo ""score team 1 $value&lt;br/&gt;"";
    mysql_query(""UPDATE games SET game_score1 = '"".$value[]""' WHERE games_id = [1,2,3] "");

Given the freshness of 4.0, not a lot of blogs out there for issues yet, so I'm hoping someone here has an idea.  Preface: this is a Web Forms application, coming from 3.5 SP1 to 4.0.</p>

<p>In the <code>Application_Start</code> event we're iterating through the SiteMap and constructing routes based off data there (prettifying URLs mostly with some utility added), that part isn't failing though...or at least isn't not getting that far.  </p>

<p>It seems that calling the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.xmlsitemapprovider.rootnode%28VS.90%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">SiteMap.RootNode</a> (inside application_start) causes 4.0 to eat it, since the <code>XmlSiteMapProvider.GetNodeFromXmlNode</code> method has been changed, looking in reflector you can see it's hitting <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpresponse.applyapppathmodifier.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>HttpResponse.ApplyAppPathModifier</code></a> here:</p>

<pre><code>str2 = HttpContext.Current.Response.ApplyAppPathModifier(str2);
</code></pre>

<p><code>HttpResponse</code> wasn't used at all in this method in the 2.0 CLR, so what we had worked fine,  in 4.0 though, that method is called as a result of this stack:</p>

<pre><code>[HttpException (0x80004005): Response is not available in this context.]
System.Web.XmlSiteMapProvider.GetNodeFromXmlNode(XmlNode xmlNode, Queue queue)
System.Web.XmlSiteMapProvider.ConvertFromXmlNode(Queue queue)
System.Web.XmlSiteMapProvider.BuildSiteMap()
System.Web.XmlSiteMapProvider.get_RootNode()
System.Web.SiteMap.get_RootNode()
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>Response</code> isn't available here in 4.0, we get an error.  To reproduce this, you can narrow the test case down to this in global:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  var s = SiteMap.RootNode; //Kaboom!
  //or just var r = Context.Response; 
  //or var r = HttpContext.Current.Response;
  //all result in the same ""not available"" error
}
</code></pre>

<p>Question: <strong>Am I missing something obvious here?</strong>  Or, <strong>is there another event added in 4.0 that's recommended for anything related to SiteMap on startup?</strong></p>

<p>For anyone curious/willing to help, I've created a very minimal project (a default VS 2010 ASP.Net 4.0 site, all the bells &amp; whistles removed and only a blank sitemap and the <code>Application_Start</code> code added).  It's a small 10kb zip available here: <a href=""http://www.ncraver.com/Test/SiteMapTest.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncraver.com/Test/SiteMapTest.zip</a></p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Update:</strong></h2>

<p>Not a great solution, but the current work-around is to do the work in <code>Application_BeginRequest</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>private static bool routesRegistered = false;
protected void Application_BeginRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  if (!routesRegistered)
  {
    Application.Lock();
    if (!routesRegistered) RouteManager.RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);
    routesRegistered = true;
    Application.UnLock();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't like this particularly, feels like an abuse of the event to bypass the issue.  Does anyone have at least a better work-around, since the .Net 4 behavior with SiteMap is not likely to change?</p>

<p>I wrote a command line *.exe app (call it <code>myapp.exe</code>) that accept some arguments and make his work basically using input and output files.
This app is called by a 3rd party application, pretending that <code>myapp.exe</code> is in his <code>\root\bin</code> folder.
Input and output files are difficult to replicate for tests, so I would find much easier do something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build my solution </li>
<li>Using some <code>PostBuildEvents</code>, deploy assemblies in calling app's <code>\root\bin</code> folder on my disk</li>
<li>Launch Visual Studio in debug mode, <strong>but using assemblies and <code>*.pdb</code> deployed in <code>\root\bin</code> folder</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Is that a thing I can do?<br>
I know <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y7f5zaaa.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Visual Studio Remote Debugging</a> function, but <code>myapp.exe</code> is not a process I can attach to.</p>

<p>Some ideas? :)</p>

<p>Main thread dispatches an event to topic ""foo"" using a threadPoolExecutor. The event may go to some number of consumers that have subscribed to ""foo"". These consumers inspect the event data and decide if there is a problem or not.</p>

<p>I want main thread to pause and wait until one of the conditions are met:</p>

<ol>
<li>All consumers get the event, finish running and find no problems. Main thread resumes execution</li>
<li>One of the consumers finds a problem, Main thread should throw an exception</li>
<li>One of the consumers takes too long to run, Main thread should resume execution but log a warning</li>
</ol>

<p>So something like</p>

<pre><code>// dispatch event to all consumers
notify(""foo"", event);
// wait on all consumers to either finish or timeout after 100 ms
// consumers are running on X separate threads, doing their analysis
boolean anyErrors = waitOnConsumers(100);
if(anyErrors){

If someone could help me figure this out I'd greatly appreciate it! Here's my code.</p>

<p>JavaScript Document:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {

    jQuery.fn.timer = function () {
        var $quote = $('#quote').children;
        var i = ('$quote p').css('display', ':visible');
        $quote.eq(i).animate({
            opacity: 0
        }, 300).css('display', ':none');

        if (i &gt; $quote.length) {
            i = 0;
            $quote.eq(i).css('display', ':visible').animate({
                opacity: 100
            }, 300);

        } else {
            $quote.eq(i + 1).css('display', ':visible').animate({
                opacity: 100
            }, 300);
        }


        window.setInterval(function () {
            $('#quote').timer();
        }, 5000);

    });
})(); (edit)

<p>But there are issues in other browsers/modes:</p>

<p>In Chrome the line between head and body is double width:</p>

<p>In IE8 (switched into IE7 compatibility mode) all lines are double width:</p>

<p>Now of course this is giving me the error <em>Binary XML file line #7: Error inflating class com.google.android.maps.MapView</em></p>

<p>I have tried importing the <a href=""https://github.com/petedoyle/android-support-v4-googlemaps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/petedoyle/android-support-v4-googlemaps</a> package and replacing the already existing android-support-v4 package but when I try to run my app, it dies with the error that it can't find the ActivityMain class.</p>

<p>First question, am I even going about this in the right way? Should I be using this 1 main activity and loading all the other things in Fragments?</p>

<p>Next, if I am doing this in a correct way, is there a <em>good</em> tutorial for how to get this to work in a decent way? I can't find anything online except for other people asking the same questions and a few tutorials that haven't worked for me.</p>

Here's the code that I wrote in, but <code>client.query</code> doesn't work at all here:</p>

<pre><code>
var pg = require(""pg"");

exports.batting = function(req, res) {
    var conString = ""postgres://myUserName:myPassword@localhost:5432/baseball"";
    var client = new pg.Client(conString);

            console.log(err);
        } else {
            console.log(""will execute a query"");
            client.query(""select * from batting;"", function(err, result) {

                console.log(""success"");
            });
        }
    });

}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I wrote the code above to another file, not in a root <code>app.js</code> file.</p>

<p>However, when I run my app and access the appropriate url, it does return nothing. And while <code>enter connect</code> and <code>will execute a query</code> are displayed in my Terminal, it looks like that the execution stopped in <code>client.query</code> and not display <code>success</code> there.</p>

<p>So why does it not work as expected? I do neither have any prior experience nor knowledge of postgres - I usually use mysql and just installed postgres since heroku doesn't allow me to use mysql (actually I can use it through a third-party plugin, though). And I've been able to successfully return the result when I use mysql, so the cause is likely related to be my setup with postgres server.</p>

<p>Note that my postgres server is running, and I confirmed that my username, password, and dbname are correct (I did reset my password, actually).</p>

<p>If the page is exported from Confluence as pdf the current status of the page (to be reviewed, to be approved, approved) and the user which reviewed and approved the page should be visible at the head of the page. So I want to have a user macro or programmed (Java) macro which displays these informations.</p>

<h2>My Problem</h2>

<p>I can't figure out how the <a href=""https://wiki.comalatech.com/display/CW/API+Services"" rel=""nofollow"">API of the Comala Workflows</a> works. I want to access current workflow state and the users which did these changes.</p>

<p>Furthermore I can't find any API documentation on how to access the workflow state of the page or how to initialize and use the services (like the <code>com.comalatech.workflow.StateService</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Has anybody used the public Comala Workflows API or does know how to access the workflow states (either in Java or in a User Macro)?</strong></p>

<p>I tried finding tutorials and going through the one in the book but it seems like MVVM light has gone through quite a few changes making the tutorials very hard to follow.</p>

<p>I then looked at Simple MVVM and it looked promising but it looks like the author does not have that much time anymore and looks like the project might be dead(so when I go to windows 8 phones or windows 8 app I got to learn a new toolkit...)</p>

<p>I am looking for something simple and that has lots of tutorials and goes far beyond just the basics.</p>

<p>What I found with MVVM light is that you see him talk about how you can basically not have to use code behind(ie for navigation) but since there are no tutorials on how to show you step by step to do this it makes it very hard to figure out how to do.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ImageSource x:Key=""..\Resources\Images\USD.ico""&gt;../Resources/Images/USD.ico&lt;/ImageSource&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The property is as follows</p>

<pre><code>public string CurrencyImg
{
    get
    {
        if (DisplayUSDRate)
        {
            return AppString.General.ImagePath + AppString.CurrencyId.USD + "".ico"";
        }
        else
        {
            return AppString.General.ImagePath + curr + "".ico"";
        }

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now when this runs, the OnPropertyChanged(""CurrencyImg"") does nothing, and it's clear why. In the XAML I'm not directly binding to the CurrencyImg property, I'm using it as a parameter to my StaticResourceExtension class, so when I call OnPropertyChanged, it thinks there are no bound properties to update, so the XAML image does not update. I can understand this, but obviously this does not help me as what I need to happen is the following.</p>

<p>1) For the class to determine which currency image gets displayed for that row
2) For the images to come from a resource dictionary so they don't get loaded more than once or performance hugely suffers
3) For changes to the DisplayUSDRate property to then reflect by updating the flag to the appropriate image. This is the bit I can't figure out how to do with my StaticResourceExtension (code below)</p>

Upon submission, I GET these entries and store them to the database, which later gets queried and posted up.  Anyway,  it takes JavaScript to grab the User's coordinates, which I need, and I've got the JavaScript embedded in my template and it's SUPPOSED to be inputting the coordinates to ""hidden"" input fields.

<p>FYI, this is all within the same form.  So, theoretically, this should be generating the latitude and longitude of the user and then passing those values to their respective input fields.  Is there any obvious reason this isn't working?  Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I have my custom task pane along with my usercontrol docked to the bottom of the main Outlook window.  I'm trying to implement auto-hide on this taskpane so that it minimizes to a certain size when the mouse leaves it.  My problem arises in the fact that custom task panes have very very few events, namely, DockChanged and VisibilityChanged.  Nothing about gaining or losing focus, or mouse entering and exiting.</p>

<p>Another problem is that the mouse entering/exiting my pane doesn't fire events on my usercontrol.  I'm assuming that this is because my user control has a flash control which fills my usercontrol.  My workaround was to use the GotFocus andLostFocus events from the flash control.  This works decently EXCEPT for the fact that if the user resizes the task pane the LostFocus event fires which causes the task pane to hide - yet still be resizing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If possible the client will keep its connections alive and use
  persistent connections with or without pipeline depending on
  configuration and current circumstances. The HTTP/1.1 specification
  does not provide a guideline for how many requests would be ideal to
  be sent on a persistent connection, this very much depends on the
  application. Note that a very long queue of requests may cause a user
  perceived delay as earlier requests may take a long time to complete.
  The HTTP/1.1 specification does suggest a limit of 2 persistent
  connections per server, which is the default value of the max_sessions

<p>However, I have read an article by Bill Venners about the object initialization in java, and there is one paragraph quoted as below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The code inside an instance initializer may not return. Except in the case of anonymous inner classes, an instance initializer may throw checked exceptions only if the checked exceptions are explicitly declared in the throws clause of every constructor in the class. Instance initializers in anonymous inner classes, on the other hand, can throw any exception.

<blockquote>
  <p>If you find yourself needing to return two things from an API then wrapping them up in a struct/class would be better than an out param.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a representative sample of the code in question.  It's part of a web application and  basically loops through a character buffer and wants to translate ""unprintable"" characters to either a replacement character or string.  To do this, the author of the <code>Translate</code> method always returns a string and the caller has to convert back to a character array.</p>

<pre><code>string character = Translate(value);
if (character.Length == 1) {
    writer.Write(character[0]);
} else {
    writer.Write(character.ToCharArray());
}

public string Translate(char value) {
    if (value &lt;= '\u017F') {
        return value.ToString();
    }

    switch (value) {
        case '\u2117':
            return '\u00A9'.ToString();  // copyright sign
        case '\u211E':
            return ""Rx""; // prescription
        // ... and lots more case statements
    }

    return value.ToString();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It seemed to me I have a couple options.  Do I make the caller infer which char or string to use based on null or String.Empty values, or be explicit with an out bool?  I don't want to new up and return a tuple object instance for every char that passes through this function, since that seems like a lot of object creation overhead and future garbage collection.</p>

<pre><code>public string Translate(char value, out char newValue)
public void Translate(char value, out char? newCharValue, out string newStringValue)
public void Translate(char value, out bool useChar, out char newCharValue, out string newStringValue)

<p>I can resolve this interactively by choosing :r1, but when I try to put this step in my script it just bails (since it's non-interactive, it doesn't give me a choice of what restart to use)</p>

<p>I'd love to say (in my script) ""just use the PS version of all clashing symbols"", but I can't figure out how to do so.</p>

<p>It would also be okay if I could say (as one might in python), ""from PS import chain, @, (etc)"" - specifying each symbol I want to import manually.</p>

I'm kind of lost on how to do that though. Here are some of the specific questions I have: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>When the user logs in, does a cookie get stored automatically? If so, where? If not, how do I store it?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I check for that cookie and access it, examine it, etc.? Maybe on a relaunch of the app or something.</p></li>
<li><p>How is storing a cookie with user credentials different than storing them in the keychain? Or are they the same thing?</p></li>
<li><p>When a user presses ""logout"" in the app, should that delete the persistent cookie? It must, right?</p></li>
<li><p>What's the best way to store these cookies? What does iOS automatically do for you, and what do you have to do yourself?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there an advantage to using ASIHTTP stuff for things like this? If so, what does the ASI library offer that the NSURL stuff doesn't? Does the treatment of cookies change when using the ASIHTTP library?</p></li>

The issue i keep grappling with is how to populate my domain objects with data. The examples i've found have been to trivial to really help me out. I've tried a variety of methods but i don't love any of them. Say you have a large set of data you need to pass into your class so you bundle it in a POCO.   </p>

<p><strong>My first direction (pass data into the constructor):</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass
{
    private readonly ICalculator _calculator;
    private readonly MyClassDataPOCO _data;

    public MyClass(ICalculator _calculator, MyClassDataPOCO data)
    {
        this._calculator = _calculator;
        _data = data
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't work out well because then your IOC containers can't automatically initialize your classes.</p>

<p><strong>Second Direction (pass data into the operation):</strong>   </p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass
{
    private readonly ICalculator _calculator;

    public MyClass(ICalculator _calculator)
    {
        this._calculator = _calculator;
    }

    public decimal CalculateComplicatedValue1(MyClassDataPOCO data)
    {

    }

    public decimal CalculateComplicatedValue2(MyClassDataPOCO data)
    {

    }
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't like this for a variety of reasons  </p>

<ol>
<li>Your class become nothing more than instance functions (not really classes). They only have behavior and not data.    </li>
<li>Your entrusting your client to your data. Doesn't seem like a smart idea. I'm sure you would eventually run into mutated state problems.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Third Direction (only allow you're class to be created through a static factory method):</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass
{
    private readonly ICalculator _calculator;
    private MyClassDataPOCO _data;

    private MyClass(ICalculator _calculator)
    {
        this._calculator = _calculator;
    }

    public static MyClass Create(MyClassDataPOCO data)
    {
        return Create(_container.GetInstance&lt;ICalculator&gt;(), data);
    }


    public static MyClass Create(ICalculator calculator, MyClassDataPOCO data)
    {
        //do some input validation here

        var myReturn = new MyClass(calculator);
        myReturn._data = data;
        return myReturn;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I guess out of all the options i like this one the best. The only thing i don't like is having to have two create functions so it can be unit tested (so i can inject ICalculator).</p>

<p>The only option i didn't try was property injection because id didn't think it was a good idea to inject your data in through properties.</p>

<pre><code>    [OperationContract]
    [WebInvoke(ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, Method = ""GET"")]
    public Stream Download(string id, bool isTemp)
    {
        //File.OpenRead(path) works inside FileBlo.Fownload 
        Stream download = FileInfoBlo.Download(id, isTemp);
        if (WebOperationContext.Current != null)
        {
            //Specifing any other mime type doesn't help
            WebOperationContext.Current.OutgoingResponse.ContentType = ""video/*"";
        }
        return download;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So the link to the file is like</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a href=""http://localhost/app-api/Apiservice.svc/download?id=8&amp;isTemp=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/app-api/Apiservice.svc/download?id=8&amp;isTemp=false</a></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The problems are:
<br>1. HTML5 playback - only Chrome can play video, but can't do anyhing else - stop, play again, seek etc. Other browsers don't play it at all. When accessing the file with just a link to the file like</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>""http://localhost/app/file.mp4""</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>it can be played.</p>

<p><br>2. JW PLayer playback - error happens - </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>an error ask Queue failed at step 5: Playlist could not be loaded: Playlist file did not contain a valid playlist</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>when accessing the file with link (as shown above) - it can play it at least.</p>

<p>As I understand such kind of ""wcf streaming"" is not suitable for video playback. 
May be WCF is not an option here at all?
So any help and advices\examples of proper video streaming whithin IIS (7+ / Server 2008) will be greatly appriciated.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

        self.response.out.write(template.render(templatePath + 'test.django.html', { 'entries': entries, 'comments': comments, }))

<p>When I view this templated page in the browser, I get:</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: 'Entry' object is not iterable
</code></pre>

<p>Changing the line <code>{% for e in entries %}</code> to <code>{% for e in entries.all %}</code> solves this problem, which is great.</p>

<p>However, this is the bit I don't understand; in another template (for the archive page), I pass in the same thing, a list of Entry objects:</p>

<pre><code>entries = db.Query(Entry).order(""-published"").fetch(limit=100)
        self.response.out.write(template.render(templatePath + 'archive.django.html', { 'entries': entries, }))

<p>With the template as follows:</p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""master.django.html"" %}

{% block pagetitle %}Home Page{% endblock pagetitle %}

{% block content %}

&lt;ul&gt;

{% for entry in entries %}

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/post/{{ entry.slug }}/""&gt;{{ entry.title|escape }} &lt;span&gt;{{ entry.published|date:""jS o\f F Y"" }}&lt;/a&gt;{% if admin %} - &lt;a href=""/compose/?key={{ entry.key }}""&gt;Edit Post&lt;/a&gt;{% endif %}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

{% endfor %}

{% endblock content %}
</code></pre>

<p>This code works fine, <em>without</em> changing <code>entries</code> to <code>entries.all</code>; indeed if I <em>do</em> change it to that I get no output (no errors, just nothing at all).</p>

<p>Can someone explain why this is please?</p>

<p>Edit: I originally pasted the wrong piece of query code for the second example, which would probably have made things easier for people to give me an answer... changed it now.</p>

For the purposes of this example, I'm trying to calculate a moving average.  So, for a list <code>'(1 2 3 4 5)</code>, the 3 period moving average would be <code>'(1 2 2 3 4)</code>.  The idea is that any numbers before the period are not yet part of the calculation, and once we reach the period length in the set, we start averaging the subset of the list according the chosen period.</p>

<p>So, my first attempt looked something like this:</p>

<pre><code>(define (avg lst)
  (cond
   [(null? lst) '()]
   [(/ (apply + lst) (length lst))]))

(define (make-averager period)
  (let ([prev '()])
    (lambda (i)
      (set! prev (cons i prev))
      (cond
       [(&lt; (length prev) period) i]
       [else (avg (take prev period))]))))

(map (make-averager 3) '(1 2 3 4 5))

&gt; '(1 2 2 3 4)
</code></pre>

<p>This works.  And I like the use of map.  It seems composible and open to refactoring.  I could see in the future having cousins like:</p>

<pre><code>(map (make-bollinger 5) '(1 2 3 4 5))
(map (make-std-deviation 2) '(1 2 3 4 5))
</code></pre>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>But, it's not in the spirit of Scheme (right?) because I'm accumulating with side effects.  So I rewrote it to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>(define (moving-average l period)
  (let loop ([l l] [acc '()])
    (if (null? l)
        l
        (let* ([acc (cons (car l) acc)]
               [next
                 (cond
                  [(&lt; (length acc) period) (car acc)]
                  [else (avg (take acc period))])])
          (cons next (loop (cdr l) acc))))))

 (moving-average '(1 2 3 4 5) 3)
 &gt; '(1 2 2 3 4)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this version is more difficult to grok at first glance.  So I have a couple questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there a more elegant way to express the recursive version using some of the built in iteration constructs of racket (like <code>for/fold</code>)?  Is it even tail recursive as written?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there any way to write the first version without the use of an accumulator variable?</p></li>
<li><p>Is this type of problem part of a larger pattern for which there are accepted best practices, especially in Scheme?</p></li>
</ol>

I'm using jQuery to show / hide the child div whenever a mouse hovers over the parent div (parent div spans the entire bottom of the page. Width: 100% and height 100px). I've used both firebug and ie developer toolbar to confirm that the parent div is on the page.</p>

<p>I can hover over the empty parent div in both Chrome and FireFox and everything works fine. IE requires that I have some sort of text inside to hover over. The div hover event will not fire with just an empty div. </p>

<p>All plausible work arounds for this issue?</p>

<p>--Update</p>

<p>Tried all of your suggestions but nothing has worked yet.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""toolBar""&gt;          
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;button id=""btnPin"" title=""Click to pin toolbar"" type=""button""&gt;

      &lt;img src=""../../images/icons/search.png"" border=""0"" alt=""Search"" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The above html is contained within a master page div container. The child div is hidden with jQuery with some hover in/out events. The parent div (toolBar) is always visible on the page. When a hover occurs on toolBar the child div is shown.</p>

<p>Heres the jQuery code</p>

<pre><code>$('#toolBar').hover(ToolBar_OnHover, ToolBar_OnBlur);

function ToolBar_OnHover() {

  $(this).children().fadeIn('fast');
  $(this).animate({ height: ""100px"" }, ""fast"");

}

function ToolBar_OnBlur() {

  $(this).children().fadeOut('fast');
  $(this).animate({ height: ""50px"" }, ""fast"");

}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally here's a little css</p>

<pre><code>#toolBar { width: 100%; height: 100px; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle; position: absolute;  bottom: 0; background-color: Transparent;  }
#toolBar div { padding: 5px 5px 0px 5px; width:75%; height: 95px; background: transparent url('/images/toolbar-background.png') repeat-x; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; }

<p>The main thing that is confusing me is the distinction between server/views and public/views.</p>

<p>I understand that when I want to require user auth I can do <code>app.get</code> with <code>auth.requiresLogin</code>.</p>

<p>But how does this mix in with the angular client side of things? How do I make the angular views available only when logged in.</p>

<p>My objective is to have the following:</p>

<p>When users go to <code>/</code> I want them to see a basic message if they are not logged in.</p>

<p>When they do log in, in <code>/</code> I want them to see my angular app.</p>

<p>I'm confused as to how to achieve that.</p>

<p>How do I structure my app for this purpose? Can I check in the template whether a user is logged in?</p>

<p>from a waste water treatment database that I've been building. This gives a by-day summary of waste water discharges, averaging the pH, Temperature, and zinc levels, and summing the discharge volume (effluent). The user selects a range in two text boxes on the ""QueryForm"" with date pickers, and  runs the query.</p>

<p>What is shown is discharges, grouped by day, for the date range, and only days that had discharges are listed. What a user has requested is for every day in the range selected to be shown, and those days without records in the ""DischargeDatabase"" just have zeros for the field values.</p>

<p>i.e. from this (date range 4/11/2013 to 4/16/2013, over a weekend):</p>

<pre><code>Date      | ph Value | Temperature (°C) | Zinc (mg/l) | Discharge (gal) | # Discharges

<p>This is all so that the user can paste the query into an excel spreadsheet without issue. I'm not even sure that this is possible, or within the scope of a query (you are ""selecting"" records that don't exist). What might work is some sort of join with a bogus table/query pre-filled with zeros?</p>

<p>So my Card class is fairly simple. It creates a Card object with the parameters suit,value, and isFaceUp. All is good here. </p>

<p>Then I create the CardStack class which represents a stack of class.There are 4 types: 's' - stock, 'w' - waste, 'f' - foundations, and 't' - tableau.
It is supposed to have the following. I also included a private field ""type"" in the object and a getter and setter for it. </p>

<pre><code>public class CardStack extends Stack {
private char type;

public char getType() {
    return type;
}

public void setType(char type) {
    this.type = type;
}

public CardStack(char type) {
    this.setType(type);
    Stack&lt;Card&gt; Stack = new Stack&lt;Card&gt; ();
}

public void pushes(Card newCard) {
    this.push(newCard);
}

public Card pops() {
    this.pop();
    return null;
}

public boolean isEmpty() {
    return this.empty();
}

public int size() {
    return capacityIncrement;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However I feel like this is too easy and wrong. Does that make sense? </p>

<p>Now here is what we are supposed to do for the actual meat of the game. </p>

<p>1.""you should have an array of stacks that represent the tableau stacks, an array of stacks that represent the foundation stacks, and 2 individual stacks that represent the stock and waste stacks respectively""</p>

<p>Why do we need an array of stacks? Why isn't one stack enough? Is this what my professor wants? </p>

<pre><code>static CardStack[] tableau;
static CardStack[] foundation;
static CardStack waste = new CardStack('w');
static CardStack stock = new CardStack('s');
</code></pre>

<p>Then we create a main stack of the 52 cards which I did like this</p>

<pre><code>static Card[] mainStack = new Card[53];

for (int i = 1; i &lt; 13; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j &lt; 4; j++) {
            mainStack[i * j] = new Card(i, j, true);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I think that part is right.</p>

<p>Ok then ""move all 52 cards from the game stacks into the deck stack. Then, shuffle the deck by using the static method shuffle() in the Collections class ""</p>

<p>Here is where I get caught up. The mainstack is an Array of Card that has 52 cards in it. The deck stack is a stack which is not an array. How do I put the array into the stack and then how do I use the method shuffle on a stack. Isn't the shuffle method only for arrays?</p>

<p>There is a bunch more but I guess that's enough for now</p>

The request is that the navigation should be dynamic, so that you can, for instance, switch orders of the views without having to recompile (and ideally also adding a view without recompiling).</p>

<p>Currently I'm using an XML to define which windows to display, which header it should have and how the footer should look like. Here's how the XML looks now:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?&gt;
&lt;ArrayOfViewState xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""&gt;
  &lt;ViewState ViewName=""WelcomeView"" Header=""Welcome to the Application"" FooterButton1=""Quit"" FooterButton2=""Back"" FooterButton3=""Next"" /&gt;
  &lt;ViewState ViewName=""LicenseView"" Header=""Licence Agreement"" FooterButton1=""Quit"" FooterButton2=""Back"" FooterButton3=""Next"" /&gt;
  &lt;ViewState ViewName=""LoginView"" Header=""Log in"" FooterButton1=""Quit"" FooterButton2=""Back"" FooterButton3=""Next"" /&gt;
  &lt;ViewState ViewName=""InstallationView"" Header=""Installing..."" FooterButton1=""Cancel"" FooterButton2=""None"" FooterButton3=""Next"" /&gt;
  &lt;ViewState ViewName=""UpdateView"" Header=""Updating..."" FooterButton1=""Cancel"" FooterButton2=""None"" FooterButton3=""Next"" /&gt;
  &lt;ViewState ViewName=""FinishedView"" Header=""Finished!"" FooterButton1=""None"" FooterButton2=""None"" FooterButton3=""Finish"" /&gt;
&lt;/ArrayOfViewState&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And when I match this in the code it looks like this (viewState.View is of type UserControl):</p>

<pre><code>...
case ""WelcomeView"":
  viewState.View = new WelcomeView();
...
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I use the ViewName property in the XML to match and create my views (they also have a ViewModel, but that is taken care through XAML and the MVVM Light ViewModel Locator).</p>

<p>This solution technically allows the navigation to be changed somewhat without recompiling (for example you can shuffle the order any way you like), but there must be a better way to handle this than matching a string property. I've tried looking into serializing the User Control so that I could just load it along with the other properties, but so far I've had no luck. Any ideas on how to go about and improve/change this?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Q1:</strong>  When is the instance of <code>HelperUtil</code> which will be injected actually initialized by calling the default constructor?  Is it done when the first client into which it is injected (like <code>BusinessManager</code>) is instantiated when the app server (in my case <code>JBoss</code>) starts (and that one will be initialized by the container because it is annotated as <code>@Stateless</code>)?</p>

<p><strong>Q2:</strong>  In the above exhibit, will <code>HelperUtil</code> remain a <code>singleton</code> as long as no client other than the container asks for an instance by calling the constructor directly and not obtaining an instance via <code>DI</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Q3:</strong>  What is the advantage of using DI and <code>@Inject</code> in this case vs. simply calling the constructor directly (<code>HelperUtil helper = new HelperUtil();</code>)?</p>

<p>The question is : <strong>why is the first textbox not green</strong>?

But the button doesn't respond to touches. I've tried an animation block but the button simply moves immediately to its end coordinates, while the frame shows the animation (the button is called bubble):</p>

<pre><code>[UIView beginAnimations:nil context:nil];
    [UIView setAnimationDuration:5.0];
    CGAffineTransform newTransform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(3, 3);
    bubble.transform = CGAffineTransformTranslate(newTransform, 0, -460);
    [UIView commitAnimations];
</code></pre>

<p>So then I tried Core Animation with the help of some sample code (the path isn't important, it's just an example):</p>

<pre><code>CGMutablePathRef thePath = CGPathCreateMutable();
    CGPathMoveToPoint(thePath,NULL,15.0f,15.f);
    CGPathAddCurveToPoint(thePath,NULL,
                          15.f,250.0f,
                          295.0f,250.0f,
                          295.0f,15.0f);
    CAKeyframeAnimation *theAnimation=[CAKeyframeAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@""position""];
    theAnimation.path=thePath;
    CAAnimationGroup *theGroup = [CAAnimationGroup animation];
    theGroup.animations=[NSArray arrayWithObject:theAnimation];
    theGroup.timingFunction=[CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithName:kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseIn];
    theGroup.duration=15.0;
    CFRelease(thePath);
    [bubble.layer addAnimation:theGroup forKey:@""animatePosition""];
</code></pre>

<p>But the buttons still don't respond to touches. Btw, I have several of these 'bubble' buttons on screen at once so having several NSTimers concurrently active wouldn't be optimal. </p>

<p>Can anyone suggest another approach? Should I perhaps animate UIImageViews and make them repsond to touches? Or will I have the same problem? This has been puzzling me for a couple of days so any help much appreciated. </p>

I know there are other threads on this subject, but I am no server wizard, the symptoms are different and my server config is slightly different as well, or so I think.</p>

<p>This is my situation.</p>

<ul>
<li>The application works fine, until I post a form for the nth time (n being anywhere between 2 and n times). This nth time is exactly the same as the earlier postings. I just change one field and then press the submit button.</li>
<li>The form uses the validation class, and I customized the error message setter in such a way that these messages are also set as flashdata in the session (I want the messages to be available after a redirect).</li>
<li>My server uses Nginx and apache (Plesk, apache service daemon is called httpd). If I do ""service httpd stop"" or ""service nginx stop"" all my websites stop working immediately. </li>
<li>There are no errors in the error log. </li>
</ul>

<p>My question is this: Could this be a coding issue, or is it most definately (or most likely) a misconfiguration of the server? If it is the latter, all advice is welcome of course, but remember it is a plesk/apache/nginx environment.</p>

The tricky one is determining the list of dependencies (Depends:). I was hoping that dpkg-gencontrol could do this for me by looking at the ldd output for the executables in the package directory. Perhaps it can, but I can't get it to work.</p>

<p>If this is what <code>dpkg-gencontrol</code> is for, the error I am getting is:</p>

<pre><code>dpkg-gencontrol: error: syntax error in control_template at line 7: first block lacks a source field.

<p>For reference, the command is <code>dpkg-gencontrol -v1.1 -ccontrol_template -lchangelog -Pdebian</code>. The control_template file contains this:</p>

Maintainer: Joe Coder &lt;joe@coder.com&gt;
Description: The my-package system
 A longer description that runs to the end of one line and then 
 extends to another line.

</code></pre>

<p>If this is not what <code>dpkg-gencontrol</code> is for, does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do, or advice on how to set up the dependencies list, ideally automatically?</p>

<p>Admittedly, inferring dependencies in a general way is probably a very difficult problem, especially if you extend the search to scripts and other programs. I am hoping that some tools exists that works most of the time.</p>

<p>Note that this is for internal distribution only. I am not building a package to go into a Linux distribution or even to be downloaded by the general public, so I am happy to bend/break standard rules if needed.</p>

<p>More specifically, I understand the role of <code>$this-&gt;form_validation-&gt;set_rules()</code>, and how <code>set_value()</code> works to repopulate input values when the validation failed, but what I can't figure out is if <code>$this-&gt;input-&gt;post</code> is the same value as the <code>set_value</code> equivalent. </p>

<p>I understand that the majority of validation rules would have a boolean result, however what about ones like <code>trim|htmlspecialchars</code> - these also have the benefit of preparing the data for db queries. </p>

<p>So in my model, can I access the inputs after being processed by the Form Validation library, or should I do the additional preparation inside the model directly onto <code>$this-&gt;input-&gt;post('variable')</code>? </p>

<p>My gut tells me that I should add final processing like <code>htmlspecialchars</code> right before the SQL in the model, as it is really a db specific operation (I would not want <code>&amp;amp;</code> instead of <code>&amp;</code> in my form inputs, but I would want <code>&amp;amp;</code> in the database). </p>

<p>Incidentally in my reading I did come across <code>$this-&gt;validation-&gt;variable</code> which would appear to have been the answer to my question in previous CI versions. </p>

<p>Currently, the getLabel-method is looking like this:</p>

<p>As it stands, this works fine as the <code>max: maxDepthRange</code> actually is 12000 (fetched from database). But, whenever the value of maxDepthRange changes from 12000, I'd like the getLabel-method to handle this, but I can't seem to figure out how to pass along an additional parameter.
This is what I've tried, having set the getLabel-call to <code>getLabel(e, maxDepthRange)</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function getLabel(e, maxDepthVal) {
    if (e.value === maxDepthVal) {
        return e.value;
    }
    else if (e.value === 0) {
        return e.value;
    }
    else {
        return '';
    }
}

<p>The funny thing is that in the master page I have a timer.  This timer is only supposed to trigger the UpdatePanel in the master but it seems to trigger all of my update panels.  However, even when it triggers the update panel in the child page, the second DropDownList does not change its data.</p>

<p>The data is databound to the DropDownList in the UpdatePanel in page_init. It is bound to an objectdatasource which uses the selected item in the first DropDownList as a parameter to determine what data it should bind.</p>

After installing it, I wanted to install the DebugKit. Should I install the DebugKit manually because I installed the CakePHP manually? Or it's totally unrelated?</p>

<p>First of all, I'm totally new to composer! But I tried the composer-way instructions (because it seems the recommended way) and added the following lines to CakePHP composer.json:</p>

<pre><code>""require"": {
    ""cakephp/debug_kit"": ""2.2.*""
}
</code></pre>

<p>And Although not mentioned, then I executed ""composer install"" in the CakePHP install folder, because just adding these lines did not do anything! But then I had two root folders for plugin, i.e. <em>plugin</em> and <em>plugins</em>, and for vendor, i.e. <em>vendor</em> and <em>vendors</em>. The newly created vendor folder had some folders (other than DebugKit). And the DebugKit is now under <em>plugin</em> root folder not <em>app/plugin</em>.</p>

<p>So why are these newly created vendor and plugin folder if there exist their plural ones (vendors and plugins)?</p>

<p>If I installed the DebugKit manually I didn't have vendor subfolders contents (bin composer phpunit symfony/yaml autoload.php)! so if these files are needed why they did not exist before and if not why are there?</p>

<p>If I should totally ignore composer.json in manual installation, why is it there? And with some content differently from the suggested one for installing CakePHP with composer!?</p>

This is a sort of typical applied statistics-type program where everyone writes their own code and project sizes are on the small side, so it can be hard for people to see the trouble caused by sloppy habits.  </p>

<p>In talking about avoidance of globals, I'm focusing on the following <strong>reasons why globals might cause trouble</strong>, but I'd like to have some <strong>examples in R and/or Stata</strong> to go with the principles (and any other principles you might find important), and I'm having a hard time coming up with believable ones.</p>

<ul>
<li>Non-locality: Globals make debugging harder because they make understanding the flow of code harder</li>
<li>Implicit coupling: Globals break the simplicity of functional programming by allowing complex interactions between distant segments of code </li>
<li>Namespace collisions: Common names (x, i, and so forth) get re-used, causing namespace collisions</li>
</ul>

<p>A useful answer to this question would be a reproducible and self-contained code snippet in which globals cause a specific type of trouble, ideally with another code snippet in which the problem is corrected.  I can generate the corrected solutions if necessary, so the example of the problem is more important.</p>

<p>An example of how this would be used:</p>

<pre><code>item_group: {
  name: ""Televisions"",
  item_attributes: [
    { name: ""Screen Size"", min: 14, max: 90 type: ""single"" },
    { name: ""Screen Type"", min:0, max: 0, type: ""multiple"", item_attribute_values: [
        { name: ""LCD"", order: 0 },
        { name: ""LED"", order: 1 },
        { name: ""Plasma"", order: 2 }
     ]}
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I really care about for version history is the ItemAttributes. Right now, if something is changed in an ItemAttribute ( ex: name, min, max, or type ), a new version will be created. However, if an ItemAttributeValue is updated, deleted, or added it won't create a new ItemAttribute -- which is what we want. For example, if someone adds the ItemAttributeValue { name: 'CRT', order: 3 } to ""Screen Types"", then the ""Screen Types"" ItemAttribute should get a new version. Version 1 would have ""LCD"",""LED"",""Plasma"", Version 2 would have ""LCD"",""LED"",""Plasma"",""CRT"". And if someone removed an ItemAttributeValue, that would create yet another version.</p>

<p>Previously, ItemAttribute wasn't embedded in ItemGroup, so I was able to use Mongoid::Versioning and that worked exactly as I wanted it to. However, the decision was made to embed ItemAttribute within ItemGroup, and I wasn't able to use Mongoid::Versioning anymore, so I switched to Mongoid::History::Tracks. This works fine for tracking changes within the model, but it isn't tracking when a models embedded documents are updated.</p>

<p>I'm starting to think that I'm going to have to fork mongoid_history to add the ability to have an option or something that tells the gem to track updates to a models embedded documents.</p>

<p>Anybody run into a situation like this before?</p>

<p>Everything actually works without problems BUT lint gave me warning that leak might occur and I should make tthis handler static... </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This Handler class should be static or leaks might occur. 
  Issue: Ensures that Handler classes do not hold on to a reference to an outer
  class Id: HandlerLeak In Android, Handler classes should be static or
  leaks might occur. Messages enqueued on the application thread's
  MessageQueue also retain their target Handler. If the Handler is an
  inner class, its outer class will be retained as well. To avoid
  leaking the outer class, declare the Handler as a static nested class
  with a WeakReference to its outer class.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My problem is that I can't simply make handler static cause I am calling non static methods depending of which message came to service. Some methods are calling other methods and there are a lot of them so it is impossible that I would need to make them all static, no? </p>

<p>Here I would need advice from you more experienced developers. How to solve this issue? Thanks</p>

What I'm trying to achieve is to ensure that if a &lt;select&gt;'s selected &lt;option&gt; has a class called <em>italic</em>, then the &lt;select&gt; then has the <em>italic</em> class added (i.e. <code>jQuery.addClass('italic')</code>).  If it doesn't, then the <em>italic</em> class is removed from the &lt;select&gt; to ensure other &lt;option&gt; elements are displayed correctly (i.e. <code>jQuery.removeClass('italic')</code>).</p>

<p>What I'm noticing with most of my attempts is that either all the &lt;select&gt; have the <em>italic</em> class or that the <em>italic</em> class isn't being removed accordingly.</p>

<p>Since I'm unsure my choice in selectors and callback logic are particularly sound or good practice in this instance (as I've been frustratingly trying to make it work) I've decided not to include the code I used in previous attempts.  Instead, refer to this small HTML &amp; CSS example:</p>

<pre>
.italic {
    font-style: italic;
}

&lt;select id=""foo"" name=""foo"" size=""1"">

  &lt;option value=""2"">Fu&lt;/option>
  &lt;option value=""3"">Baz&lt;/option>
&lt;/select>

    When IsEmpty( [Measures].[FactSales] ) or [Customer].[CustomerType].currentmember &lt;&gt; [Customer].[CustomerType].&amp;[typeA]
    Then null
    ELSE ([Customer].[CustomerType].&amp;[typeA], [Measures].[FactSales] )
END
</code></pre>

<p>but I think this is wrong, and i also can't use this same method to get the value of all the other types excluding the typeA. I also dont get the aggregation when i roll it up to a higher level.</p>

<p>Can anyone help? I may not have explained my self well enough so please let me know if you need more info.</p>

<p>I have the following piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>if (labelEast.center.x &gt; (east_oldPosition.x + 50) )
        NSLog(@""Time to switch to previous exercise !"");
    else if (labelEast.center.x &lt; (east_oldPosition.x - 50) )
        NSLog(@""Time to switch to next exercise !"");
</code></pre>

<p>After setting a breakpoint, I am just trying to watch <code>labelEast.center.x</code> (<code>labelEast</code> is a <code>UILabel</code> object). Since I could not find a watch item in a Xcode 4 menu, I am trying to use gdb. I am used to print variable/object values with <code>po</code> (print object). But now, I cannot display <code>labelEast</code> <code>center</code> property because it is inherited from a mother class.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(gdb) po labelEast.center<br>
  There is no member named center.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not understand why gdb says this whereas the code works fine and sees the property.</p>

<p>Thus I have 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to watch such a property  without gdb in a graphical way (as simply as in Visual Studio) ?</li>
<li>How to do the same with gdb ?</li>
</ol>

<p>Many thanks,
Franz</p>

<hr>

<p>Unfortunately, I tried it but got this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>po [labelSouth center]</p>
  
  <p>Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
  Reason: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at address: 0x1a000356 0x343c7d06 in

  a function called from GDB. GDB remains in the frame where the signal
  was received. To change this behavior use ""set unwindonsignal on""

<p>And when I try:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(gdb) print labelSouth.center<br>

<p>I really suspect there is no access to center property in <code>UILabel</code>. But how can me code run ???</p>

In C++/STL, all values in a map can be updated in O(n) time using an iterator without using keys to access each element. Is there a way to obtain similar behavior with any of the C# collections such as SortedList, SortedDictionary?</p>

<p>I can do something like</p>

<pre><code>foreach (int key in list.Keys)
{
    list[key] *= 3;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that would take O(n * log(n)) as the searching each element using key takes log(n).</p>

<p>Just to give an idea, I am looking for something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>SortedList&lt;int, double&gt; list = new SortedList&lt;int,double&gt;();

// Add few values fist

// E.g. first try ...
IList&lt;double&gt; values = list.Values;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; values.Count; i++)
{
    values[i] *= 3;
}

// E.g. second try
foreach (KeyValuePair&lt;int, double&gt; kv in list)
{
    kv.Value *= 3;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since the List is already sorted it should be possible to traverse it updating values (not keys) at the same time. It doesn't look like there is a problem with that from the implementation point of view, but for some reason the functionality is not made available it seems.</p>

<p>Also this is not a trivial case as the same method can be used to iterate from a known position to another modifying values in that range.</p>

<p>Is there a way to do this in C# with any of the keyed collections in .NET without using 3rd party libraries?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

The game is running fine, so I want to take this opportunity to hone my core.typed skills. I have annotated the protocol (as shown below), but when I run <code>(cf method-name)</code> or <code>(cf protocol-name)</code> in the repl, I get this error:</p>

<p>eg:</p>

<pre><code>=&gt; `(cf win)`

</code></pre>

<p>I have checked to make sure that the version of protocol is in fact core.typed/protocol. The console barked at me when I used protocol> saying the syntax was deprecated. I have also looked through the documentation on both the github page and clojure-doc.org. This is how I learned that there is an optional <code>:methods</code> keyword that I can use to map methods to types. I feel that this might remove a lot of repetition from my code, but I haven't been able to find any examples of its usage. the main strategy methods in the protocol all have side effects and return <code>nil</code>. The validation methods either return <code>nil</code> or the original <code>Strategy</code> methods that they validating. I am not sure I have the syntax right there, but the code is evaluating fine in LightTable, with or without the <code>Fn</code> signature, and they the core.typed wiki implies that it is not always necessary. </p>

<p>I feel like I am on the cusp here in learning this amazing library and would appreciate any insightful advice that could help my understanding.</p>

<p>By default, The AdView will have no size until the ad is loaded. Which could cause problem if you have buttons above or below the ad. </p>

<p>User could accidentally click on the ad if the ad returned at the exact moment they are about to click a button.</p>

using this quick fix: reserve the space by putting ad in some layout that

<p>I have an app that brings up a modal to create a new Alarm type object.  The modal has a couple screens to it, like repeating days.  Similar to Apple's repeating days view, I push a new viewController that shows just the repeating days.  When I go back to the main screen of the modal where the user enters the name of the alarm, can I just call saveContext?  I guess I was wondering if I ever need to worry about calling saveContext for the smaller screens, like repeating days, and then the user hits Done on the main modal screen and I immediately call saveContext again.  </p>

<p>Suppose I have N number of html pages. Content on these pages is loaded by using some javascript. I use data from an API and load that. I can put all these pages in a folder and start running it and it works quite well.
But that is not how I want to put them on server. I don't want to show the pages filename such as <code>filename.html</code> and I want to show urls in browser of the same pattern as <code>rest services</code>.</p>

  <p>I know  how I can put them in a servlet container and manage the pages using servlet url. That way I can do pretty much I want.</p>
  
  <p>But This time I don't want to use JavaEE. I want to explore a new technology by which I can manage the pages on server. I am thinking of how I can manage the urls for pages using javascript.</p>

When a user clicks a button, I run an animation to transform the ContentPresenter's Height and Width properties to 896,1024 (actually it does 3 rotations whilst its growing, too) and this is all good...</p>

<p>The DataContext for the User control implements IDataErrorInfo and if the user does not click the 'I have read and understand these Health &amp; Safety instructions"" checkbox, then a red border is shown around the checkbox...</p>

<p>My problem is that if the user clicks 'Cancel', and I run the animation that shrinks the Height &amp; Width back down to 0,0, then the UserControl shrinks as required, but the red border does not completely disappear - it leaves a single red pixel in the middle of my Window</p>

<p>Anybody any ideas what I'm doing wrong? The 'red-border', I'm assuming is just an Adorner being rendered by WPF for me, so I'm not sure how to change this behaviour...</p>

<p>All help much appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> - I tried Abe's excellent suggestion, but unfortunately it didn't work, but it did get me trying other stuff... So now I have (temporarily) commented out the 'shrinking' animations, and simply set the visibility to Collapsed at KeyTime=""0:0:0.9""... when I press cancel, just less than a second later, the UserControl disappears but the red adorner stubbornly remains :(</p>

<p>As an extra bit of info (not sure if relevant?) the UserControl being shown in the ContentPresenter also contains a ContentPresenter to render a UserControl, and its the inner content that contains the validation adorner...</p>

insert into mytable values ('Shirt','Blue')
insert into mytable values ('Sweater','Red')

That's clear that non-ascii character are not recommended in an URL. That's the cause of my problem and I have changed that.</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @tmp TABLE
(
ID int,
username nvarchar(50),  -- data taken from tbl_Users
site nvarchar(50),      -- data taken from tbl_Sites
region nvarchar(100),   -- data taken from tbl_Regions
currency nvarchar(5)    -- data taken from tbl_Currencies
)

<p>I spend a lot of time looking through the Object Explorer to ensure that the data length of the columns in correct (matches the original tables).  Sometimes if I change the table schema but don't update all the procedures, I might get caught out with a truncation error.</p>

<p>Is there any issue with taking a lazy approach and just doing this:</p>

site nvarchar(max),
region nvarchar(max),

<p>Does <code>nvarchar(max)</code> actually use up any more memory or this the allocated memory based on the data size?  Are there any other gotchas?</p>

<p>Please note that I am aware of third-party tools for jumping to the definition, but that's not what I'm asking.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>The duplicate question has value, but the question is not identical IMHO.  The duplicate revolves around the design of actual tables, not <strong>table variables</strong>.  However, there is some merit in the answers, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>nvarchar(max) vs nvarchar(8000) are no different in resource usage until 8000+ data lengths</li>
<li>Business logic layers rely on structure and <em>meaningful</em> data, so specifying a column size that compliments the original provides value</li>
</ul>

<p>In that sense, it would seem that it is fine to use <code>nvarchar(max)</code> in table variables instead of <code>nvarchar(n)</code>, but it has a reliability and performance risk in <em>some</em> environments.  If you think this should be deleted then fair enough (but please stop arguing I appreciate <strong>all</strong> input!)</p>

<p>These are my tables:</p>

<pre><code>-----------------------------------
ID | ChapterNo | HitCount |  MID
-----------------------------------
1  |    2      |   1000   |   1
2  |    2      |   2000   |   1
3  |    1      |   3000   |   1
4  |    3      |   1000   |   1
5  |    1      |   3500   |   1
-----------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>to archive the result, i tried to use the ff query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT t1.id, t1.hitcount, t1.chapterno
    FROM chapter as t1
    WHERE t1.hitcount = (select max(hitcount) from chapter where chapterno = t1.chapterno and `mid` = t1.`mid`)
    AND t1.`mid` = '2524'
    ORDER BY t1.chapterno DESC

ID | ChapterNo | HitCount |  
---------------------------
4  |    3      |   1000   |
2  |    2      |   2000   |
5  |    1      |   3500   |
---------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>This query seem to works really fine at first, but in scale, after I import 80,000 records for testing and implementing. I find out that this ran for 30second. A explain shows:</p>

<pre><code>sel_type  table      type   posible_key  key       keyLen   ref        rows        Extra
PRIMARY   t1         ref    mid_idx      mid_idx    8       const      *3289*    Using where; Using filesort
PRIMARY   chapter    ref    mid_idx      mid_idx    8       m.t1.mid   *17*      Using where; Using temporary; Using filesort
</code></pre>

<p>The result set is 640 rows. Is there any real good way to optimize this for larger table? Since this table and especialy this query will grow more in the future. </p>

<p>Will using procedure in mysql helps any for this query?</p>

<p>Thank you very much</p>

<p>I tried jQuery for this and for whatever the reason, <code>$('.image').closest($('.content'))</code> didn't work for me so it always selected the first <code>.content</code> and adjusted <code>margin-top</code> based on that.</p>

<p>If you can show me a jQuery or CSS approach on how to do this, that'd be great. I tried several ways of doing that with CSS, but none of them worked because all of my elements have a float (<code>image</code> and <code>content</code> are located horizontally next to each other).</p>

"28290943","1","","","2015-02-03 03:37:07","","1","389","<p>I am getting an OutOfMemoryError crash on only certain higher-end phones when displaying images.  The worst ones seem to be the Samsung galaxy S4 and S5. I get no errors whatsoever on older phones or tablets, including the Nexus 4, and Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10"".  The Nexus 5 seems to have no crashes either.</p>

<p>My app is a game book that displays long strings of text in a scrollview, and occasionally an image at the top of the scrollview.  I have a background that is 450x750px in the background at all times.  The images that I use in the imageviews from time to time are 700x900px.  I also occasionally go to a battle with many images as well and then back to the scrollview with text and background.</p>

<p>Drastically reducing the sizes of my images in the drawable folder keeps the game from crashing immediately, but after several minutes of play, it still crashes when loading images and gives outofmemoryerror, especially on the Samsung Galaxy S5.  On top of that, my drawable assets now look poor, as their size has been severely reduced to accommodate these newer devices, when high res images worked fine on older devices.</p>

<p>Most of my images are loaded in the XML, not programmatically in Java, either as backgrounds on views/layouts or as src's on imageviews.  Since no tutorials seem to ever mention removing such image references from memory, I had thought it was safe to assume that they were collected and removed automatically.  If that is not the case, I am unsure how to remove them and make more room in memory for new images.  </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is there any way to remove images from memory that are defined in XML once they have been displayed without nullifying the src, and thus making it not display the next time you want to view that layout?  </p>

<p>I have considered no longer using android:background or android:src in the XML and just doing it programmatically instead, but I don't see why this should be necessary.  To quote another StackOverflow user who asked a similar question and never had it properly answered:  ""Surely though, there must be a way of removing ImageViews from memory that are no longer used?""</p>

<p>If I need to  do this all in java to avoid the memory errors, is this the proper form to remove the image from memory when I am done with it?  </p>

<pre><code>ImageView image = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.illustration1);
image.setImageDrawable(null); 
</code></pre>

<p>And then set it with this when I need it again?:</p>

<pre><code>image.setImageResource(R.drawable.example_drawable);
</code></pre>

When in the first time it was a miracle how good it works, we now run against walls with this strategy.</p>

<p>Our problem is, that we have now (from a team of 10-12 people) a lot of special jobs, e.g. release manager, QA, architect, SQL specialist.</p>

<p>More and more we define tasks which can only be used by those special people and not by the team. E.g.: Deploy Version 1.8 -> Only release manager is allowed to do that.</p>

<p>The problem now is that 50% are overloaded and 50% have nothing to do, because we only plan 70% of our working hours as effective and the mandatory tasks are more and more for the special people.</p>

<p>How to deal with that?</p>

<p>I have a few ideas, but I'm not sure which are the most agile.</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a buffer for mandatory tasks (20% of team time) and plan the rest for the whole team.</li>

I've referenced the <code>Mono.Data.Sqlite</code>, <code>System.Data</code>, and <code>System.Data.Linq</code> assemblies. Both the Sqlite file and the table exist. The <code>Status</code> class has <code>Table</code> and <code>Column</code> attributes. When I use Mono's Sqlite library alone, I can successfully insert.</p>

<pre><code>Status data = GetStatusFoo();
using (SqliteConnection con = new SqliteConnection(""Data Source="" + Config.SQLITE_DB_FILE + "";Version=3;""))
{
    con.Open();

    using (SqliteCommand cmd = new SqliteCommand(""INSERT INTO "" + _table + _insert + "" VALUES "" + _values, con))
    {
        cmd.Parameters.Add(new SqliteParameter(""@Timestamp"", data.Timestamp));
        // ...
        cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
    }
    con.Close()
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, I don't want to type out 1000 SqliteParameters, so I'm trying to use Linq-to-SQL. The following code throws a TargetInvocationException in the <code>DataContext</code> constructor. </p>

<pre><code>Status data = GetStatusFoo();
using (DataContext db = new DataContext(""Data Source="" + Config.SQLITE_DB_FILE + "";Version=3;""))
{
    Table&lt;Status&gt; statuses = db.GetTable&lt;Status&gt;();
    statuses.InsertOnSubmit(data);
    db.SubmitChanges();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It complains that <code>Version</code> isn't a valid keyword, so when I remove it, leaving just </p>

<pre><code>Status data = GetStatusFoo();
using (DataContext db = new DataContext(""Data Source="" + Config.SQLITE_DB_FILE + "";"")
{
    Table&lt;Status&gt; statuses = db.GetTable&lt;Status&gt;();
    statuses.InsertOnSubmit(data);
    db.SubmitChanges();
}
</code></pre>

<p>it throws a System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException at <code>db.SubmitChanges()</code> that the ""Server does not exist or connection refused"".</p>

<p>However, this changes when I use a SqliteConnection for DataContext's IDbConnection, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>Status data = GetStatusFoo();
using (SqliteConnection con = new SqliteConnection(""Data Source="" + Config.SQLITE_DB_FILE + "";""))
using (DataContext db = new DataContext(con))
{
    Table&lt;Status&gt; statuses = db.GetTable&lt;Status&gt;();
    statuses.InsertOnSubmit(data);
    db.SubmitChanges();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This throws a Mono.Data.Sqlite.SqliteException: <code>SQLite error   unrecognized token: ""@""</code> at <code>db.SubmitChanges();</code>.</p>

<p>Adding the <code>Version=3;</code> back doesn't help, and trying <code>Version=2</code> throws a System.NotSupportedException. The Console and DataContext.Log give something like this:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO [Status] ([Timestamp], ...) VALUES (@Timestamp, ...)

Unhandled Exception:
Mono.Data.Sqlite.SqliteException: SQLite error
unrecognized token: ""@""
</code></pre>

<p>What gives? Why doesn't it like the ""@"" symbol? Is it failing to do Parameter substitution? Or is it the <code>@@IDENTITY</code> call at the end?</p>

<p>EDIT: Additional Info</p>

<p>After poking around the stack trace, the SqliteException exception occurs in Mono.Data.SqliteCommand.BuildNextCommand, and <code>this.CommandText</code> == <code>""SELECT @@IDENTITY""</code>. Apparently this MS/Transact-SQL command isn't supported by SQLite. From what I can tell, an ""outputCommand"" for this is created in <code>DbLinq.Data.Linq.Sugar.Implementation.QueryRunner.Upsert (target={Status}, insertQuery={DbLinq.Data.Linq.Sugar.UpsertQuery})</code> </p>

<p>So I'm altering my question to include: how do I tell Linq to avoid SQL-only commands? </p>

  } 
    - (IBAction)save:(id)sender {

            [self.travel setValue:countryLabel.text forKey:@""country""];
}
</code></pre>

<p>and in the viewController which displays the cells in a tableView:</p>

            return [headers objectAtIndex:section];
        }


        - (NSInteger)numberOfSectionsInTableView:(UITableView *)tableView
        {

            return 3;
        }

        - (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section
        {
            return [self.travelAll count];
        }

&lt;/asp:scriptmanagerproxy&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine, but in order to effectively use Visual Studio's client-side debugging tools, I'd prefer not to consolidate the scripts while developing. </p>

<p>I've tried just moving all the scripts from <code>&lt;compositescripts&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;scripts&gt;</code>, thusly:</p>

<pre><code>    Private Sub ScriptManager1_PreRender(sender As Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles ScriptManager1.PreRender
        ' In development, don't combine scripts
        If IsDevelopmentEnvironment() Then
            For Each s As ScriptReference In ScriptManager1.CompositeScript.Scripts.Reverse
                ScriptManager1.Scripts.Insert(0, s)
            Next
            ScriptManager1.CompositeScript.Scripts.Clear()
        End If
    End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>This works like a charm, for the scripts in the ScriptManager itself. It doesn't see the scripts in the various ScriptManagerProxy controls, though, and those still get consolidated. While debugging I can see a ScriptManager1.Proxies collection that I'd love to iterate through, but it's ""Friend"" so I can't actually access it in code. </p>

<p>Disabling consolidation in development seems like a fairly obvious requirement, so maybe there's a much more obvious way to do this that I'm just missing? </p>

<h2>The Situation</h2>

<p>There are <code>N</code> different types of components, some of which implement an <code>IUpdatable</code> interface - those are the interesting ones. They are grouped in <code>M</code> objects, each maintaining a list of components. Updating them works like this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (GroupObject obj in objects)
{
    foreach (Component comp in obj.Components)
    {
        IUpdatable updatable = comp as IUpdatable;
        if (updatable != null)
            updatable.Update();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>The Optimization</h2>

<p>My goal was to optimize these updates for large amounts of grouping objects and components. First, make sure to update all components of one kind in a row, by caching them in one array per kind. Essentially, this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (IUpdatable[] compOfType in typeSortedComponents)
{
    foreach (IUpdatable updatable in compOfType)
    {
        updatable.Update();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The thought behind it was that the JIT or the CPU might have an easier time operating on the same object type over and over again than in a shuffled version.</p>

<p>In the next step, I wanted to further improve the situation by making sure that all data for one Component type is aligned in memory - by storing it in a struct array, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (ComponentDataStruct[] compDataOfType in typeSortedComponentData)
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; compDataOfType.Length; i++)
    {
        compDataOfType[i].Update();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>In my standalone performance tests, there is no significant performance gain from either of these changes. I'm not sure why. <em>No significant performance gains</em> means, with 10000 components, each batch running 100 update cycles, all main tests take around 85 milliseconds +/- 2 milliseconds. </p>

<p>(The only difference arises from introducing the <code>as</code> cast and <code>if</code> check, but that's not really what I was testing for.)</p>

<ul>
<li>All tests were performed in Release mode, without attached debugger.</li>
<li><p>External disturbances were reduced by using this code:</p>

<pre><code>    currentProc.ProcessorAffinity = new IntPtr(2);
    currentProc.PriorityClass = ProcessPriorityClass.High;
    currentThread.Priority = ThreadPriority.Highest;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Each test actually did some primitive math work, so it's not just measuring empty method calls which could potentially be optimized away.</p></li>
<li>Garbage Collection was performed explicitly before each test, to rule out that interference as well.</li>
<li>The full source code (VS Solution, Build &amp; Run) is available <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/5gp6f6y3cnbaf6a/FastUpdatePerformanceTest.zip?dl=0"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I would have expected a significant change due to memory alignment and repetition in update patterns. So, my core question really is: <strong>Why wasn't I able to measure a significant improvement?</strong> Am I overlooking something important? Did I miss something in my tests?</p>

So just to check it I wrote this small program where while defining function prototype I wrote it's parameter as void and while writing it's definition wrote int a as it's parameter (hoping that I will get an error, but I never got one).Then I compiled and ran the program it gave me this output</p>

<p>This program prints the square of all the numbers starting from 1 to 3</p>

<p>the square of 1 is 1 :</p>

<p>the square of 2 is 4 :</p>

<p>the square of 3 is 9 :</p>

<p>After this I changed the parameter in definition to float a (just to check if program will still work) and this time i got a different output as shown below </p>

<p>This program prints the square of all the numbers starting from 1 to 3</p>

<p>the square of 1 is 0 :</p>

<p>the square of 2 is 0 :</p>

<p>the square of 3 is 0 :</p>

<p>Can any one please explain what's happening here ? why my compiler is not throwing an error and why I'm getting two completely different output for int and float ? I'm using visual studio professional 2013 with update 4 !</p>

<p>My first goal was to index documents (pdf) to search in.</p>

<p>In the communications module of the application we develop, users can search for communications by entering keywords.
The app searches in the subject and content of communications stored in the database and now, with the index, it also searches in the content of the documents attached to the communications.</p>

<p>In that way I've to search in the database AND in the index.</p>

<p>So now I'm wondering if I should index the subject and content (e.g. : UnIndexed Lucene Field) of the communication ? Would it be faster ? Considering that the number of documents and communications will increase quickly, and so the index too.</p>

<p>This could normally be accomplished with a simple join, but the problem is the plays in <code>Outcomes</code> do not have an inning reference. It is however possible to find where the innings begin and end by observing when the <code>AtBat</code> column changes.</p>

<p>I don't see how the <code>if</code> condition actually prevents a previously created wrapper from being overwritten in the <code>QHash&lt;int,DomItem*&gt;</code> that's used.  Here is the class definition:</p>

<pre><code>class DomItem
{
public:
    DomItem(QDomNode &amp;node, int row, DomItem *parent = 0);
    ~DomItem();
    DomItem *child(int i);
    DomItem *parent();
    QDomNode node() const;
    int row();

private:
    QDomNode domNode;
    QHash&lt;int,DomItem*&gt; childItems;
    DomItem *parentItem;
    int rowNumber;
};

The datatables structures are same for both types of databases and I am trying to avoid duplicating the code and trying to find the way to minimize the code.</p>

<p>For example I wrote the following function for retrieving data from Access database:</p>

<pre><code>public static DataTable GetActiveCalls()
    {
        string select = ""SELECT call_id, call_time, msisdn, status FROM call WHERE status = 0 OR status = 1 ORDER by call_id ASC"";
        OleDbCommand cmd = new OleDbCommand(select, conn);
        DataTable dt = new DataTable(""Active Calls"");
        OleDbDataAdapter DA = new OleDbDataAdapter(cmd);
        try
        {
            conn.Open();
            DA.Fill(dt);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            string sDummy = ex.ToString();
        }
        finally
        {
            conn.Close();
        }
        return dt;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>and the following code is for SQL Express database:</p>

<pre><code>public static DataTable GetActiveCalls()
    {
        string select = ""SELECT call_id, call_time, msisdn, status FROM call WHERE status = 0 OR status = 1 ORDER by call_id ASC"";
        SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(select, conn);
        DataTable dt = new DataTable(""Active Calls"");
        SqlDataAdapter DA = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd);
        try
        {
            conn.Open();
            DA.Fill(dt);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            string sDummy = ex.ToString();
        }
        finally
        {
            conn.Close();
        }
        return dt;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>These two methods are almost the same. The only differences are SqlCommand/OleDbCommand and SqlDataAdapter/OleDbDataAdapter. 
There are also some methods which take arguments for example:</p>

<pre><code>public static void AddMessage(string callID, string content)
    {
        string select =
            ""INSERT INTO message(key, direction, content, read, write_time) VALUES (@callId, 0, @content, 0, @insertTime)"";
        OleDbCommand cmd = new OleDbCommand(select, conn);
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""callId"", callID.ToString());
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""content"", content);
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""insertTime"", DateTime.Now.ToString());
        try
        {
            conn.Open();
            cmd.ExecuteScalar();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            string sDummy = ex.ToString();
        }
        finally
        {
            conn.Close();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>In this case SQL query string is also the same for both databases but there is the difference between the type of cmd (SqlCommand/OleDbCommand).</p>

<p>I would really appreciate if anyone could give any suggestion about how to avoid duplicating the code and optimize the given problem.</p>

Currently, I'm looking at a problem with the auditing of modifications. Each entity has ChangedOn/ChangedBy and CreatedOn/CreatedBy fields, which are mapped to database columns. However, these either get filled with the wrong username or no username at all. I think this is because it has been configured in the wrong way, but I don't know enough about nHibernate and NInject to solve the issue, so I hope someone can help. Below some code snippets to hopefully provide sufficient insight in the application.</p>

<p><strong>Configuring the session factory:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public static ISessionFactory CreateSessionFactory(string connectionString, IStamper stamper)
    {
        // Info: http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Fluent_configuration
        return Fluently.Configure()

                            .AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;NHibernateHelper&gt;();

                        m.HbmMappings.AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;NHibernateHelper&gt;();
                    })
                // Register 
                .ExposeConfiguration(c =&gt; {
                    c.EventListeners.PreInsertEventListeners = 
                        new IPreInsertEventListener[] { new EventListener(stamper) };
                    c.EventListeners.PreUpdateEventListeners =
                        new IPreUpdateEventListener[] { new EventListener(stamper) };
                })
                .BuildSessionFactory();
     }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Snippet from the eventlistener:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public bool OnPreInsert(PreInsertEvent e)
{
    _stamper.Insert(e.Entity as IStampedEntity, e.State, e.Persister);
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the session factory is in a singleton scope. Therefore the eventlistener and stamper also get instantiated in this scope (I think). And this means that when the user is not yet logged in, the username in the stamper is set to an empty string or ""Unknown"".
I tried to compensate for this problem, by modifying the Stamper. It checks if the username is null or empty. If this is true, it tries to find the active user, and fill the username-property with that user's name:</p>

<pre><code>    private string GetUserName()
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(_userName))
        {
            var user = ServiceLocator.Resolve&lt;User&gt;();

            if (user != null)
            {
                _userName = user.UserName;
            }
        }

        return _userName;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>But this results in a completely different user's name, which is also logged in to the application, being logged in the database. My guess this is because it resolves the wrong active user, being the last user logged in, instead of the user that started the transaction.</p>

How can I make the dock layout panel resize the center panel so that all the children widgets of the flow panel in the center panel are all shown clearly? I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could provide some information on this.

<p>The first javascript is <a href=""http://www.chartjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Chart.js</a>, specifically the Line Chart option. The second script is an XML in HTML script by <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_to_html.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">w3schools</a>.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is using an XML file to populate the data for the line chart. I modified the code accordingly, but I have only very basic knowledge of javascript and couldn't get it to work. This is what I tried:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;canvas id=""canvas1"" width=""350"" height=""300""&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
   if (window.XMLHttpRequest)
   {    // code for IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari
        xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
   }
   else
   {    // code for IE6, IE5
        xmlhttp=new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP"");
   }
   xmlhttp.open(""GET"",""data_chart.xml"",false);
   xmlhttp.send();
   xmlDoc=xmlhttp.responseXML; 

   var x=xmlDoc.getElementsByTagName(""Row"")
   for (i=0;i&lt;x.length;i++)

   var lineChartData = {
                labels : [""1"",""2"",""3"",""4"",""5""],
                datasets : [{
                     fillColor : ""rgba(0,0,0,0.5)"",
                     strokeColor : ""rgba(0,0,0,1)"",
                     pointColor : ""rgba(0,0,0,1)"",
                     pointStrokeColor : ""#fff"",
                     data : [x[i].getElementsByTagName(""data_chart_1"")]
                   }]
           }
   var myLine = new   
   Chart(document.getElementById(""canvas1"").getContext(""2d"")).Line(lineChartData);

&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, the idea is that the data section of the variable <code>lineChartData</code> is populated by getting all elements in the row <code>data_chart_1</code> from the XML file <code>data_chart.xml</code>. Is something like this possible? How would I have to update the code to make this work? </p>

<p>Thank you very much for your help. I hope my question was clear.</p>

<p>And I could not figure out how to do the same with the latest Apache HttpClient 4.3.3.
What I want to do is to obtain the IP of the requested site. I know that this is not possible with the minimal httpclient, but how exactly should it be used?</p>

<p>Since the minimal httpclient has PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager(HttpClientConnectionManager) as argument but not ClientConnectionManager I don't know which methods to override and which attributes to set.
The example above has direct access to sockets, which is not the case with the new one.</p>

<p>So the question is how to do that with the new (4.3.3) API.
And how it is correct to keep the already resolved IPs from redirects for example, avoiding
second DNS resolution.</p>

<p>As you can see, the table ""article"" contains entry that have a column ""v1"" which stands for ""value1"".</p>

<p>The table ""article_details"" contains a reference to an article and a 2nd value (""v2""). However, the reference to the article can appear multiple times in ""article_details"".</p>

<p>The query I am looking for results in a table where the first column is the articleID (which can only appear once in the result). The 2nd column needs to contain ""v1"" + all of the ""v2""s that can be found in ""article_details"" with a reference to the articleID.</p>

<p>From the sample data above, what I need a query to do is join the two tables so as to have the following result (v3 = v1 + v2 (+v2') + (v2'')):</p>

<pre><code>Table joined

<p>v3 for the article with the id=4 is thus calculated: v3 = 5 + 7 + 3 + 2 = 17.</p>

One attrbute works (but not multiple ones).
And I can set multiple attributes on a child element.
I have tried SetAttributes with and without specifying the names of the attributes, no luck.</p>

<p>Ideas??</p>

<p><strong>example</strong></p>

<pre><code>    &lt;element xmlns:xdt=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/XML-Document-Transform"" xdt:Transform=""SetAttributes"" attrOne=""One"" attrTwo=""Two""&gt;
      &lt;children&gt;
       &lt;child name=""One"" xdt:Transform=""SetAttributes"" attrOne=""One"" attrTwo=""Two"" /&gt;
      &lt;/children&gt;
    &lt;/element&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>desired effect</strong></p>

<pre><code>    &lt;element attrOne=""One"" attrTwo=""Two""&gt;
      &lt;children&gt;
       &lt;child name=""One"" attrOne=""One"" attrTwo=""Two"" /&gt;
      &lt;/children&gt;
    &lt;/element&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The ""element"" section is really a custom section of the web.config file...like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;

... &lt;element configSource=""App_Data\element.config"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>this transformation is meant to be used on the element.config file (using slow cheetah)</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
This apparently doesn't work either:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;element xmlns:xdt=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/XML-Document-Transform"" xdt:Transform=""Replace"" attrOne=""One"" attrTwo=""Two""&gt;
  &lt;children&gt;
   &lt;child name=""One"" attrOne=""One"" attrTwo=""Two"" /&gt;
  &lt;/children&gt;
&lt;/element&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this does:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;element xmlns:xdt=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/XML-Document-Transform"" xdt:Transform=""Replace"" attrOne=""One""&gt;
  &lt;children&gt;
   &lt;child name=""One"" attrOne=""One"" attrTwo=""Two"" /&gt;
  &lt;/children&gt;
&lt;/element&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As soon as there are more than 1 attribute on the root element it fails</p>

<p>The problem is that if I load it in a web ""as is"". The WebView only allow to zoom out until the first dimension of the image is fit in screen. In this example the image height is totally shown into the WebView and then no more zoom allowed:</p>

<p>So I tried the <strong>(WebView).getSettings().setUseWideViewPort(true)</strong> and the result is that I can zoom out more than the image's width</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Camera movements via API calls or button presses (e.g., compass, my location, zoom buttons) will be relative to the padded region.</li>
  <li>getCameraPosition() will return the center of the padded region.</li>
  <li>Projection.getVisibleRegion() will return the padded region.</li>
  <li>UI controls will be offset from the edge of the container by the specified number of pixels.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>But I want the standard behaviour for all of these functions (the ones that you get without padding)!<p></p>

<p>So either: How can I only move the copyright, without altering the behaviour of the mentioned functions?<br>
Or: How do I make these functions work normally, out of the borders of the padding? </p>

When the 3 instructions mycanvas.Children.Add(whatever element I fancy) followed by Canvas.SetLeft(w.e.i.f, ptMouse.X) and Canvas.SetTop(w.e.i.f, ptMouse.Y) are executed the relevant element ends up going on the Canvas where it should, except when the element is a TextBox.  In all cases part of the canvas is off the screen (outside the Viewport), and I am only attaching small objects that fit well inside the viewport, but when I attach a TextBox, the ScrollViewer's scrollbars invariably move a little and thus cause the TextBox to appear to be positioned at an offset to the mouse point clicked.  If I move the scrollbars  back to their former position, the TextBox would be positioned at the point clicked.  A Scrollchanged event is fired when I add the TextBox to the canvas but not when I add an Image or a TextBlock of the same size to the same position on the Canvas.  What am I doing wrong.

<p>Do you have any idea, how I could force browsers to load the CSS first (which is really tiny in size) and <em>then</em> render the content? I've seen something about including the CSS files outside the <code>head</code>, but as far as I know it's against the specs, and I am afraid such hack may brake things on some mobile browsers.</p>

<p>Most of them happen on iOS 8.2.0 while app running in background.</p>

<p>I'm sure no action performs to mapview except for <code>setCenterCoordinate</code> and <code>setRegion</code> when in background.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1766/_index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Apple Q&amp;A</a> I know that I shouldn't make MKMapView redraw in background. But I tried change mapview's centerCoordinate and region in background programetically but it didn't crash.</p>

<p>Is this a bug of iOS 8.2.0 ? Is there any way to fix or avoid this? Thanks!</p>

I've been following book ""ZendFramework - A Beginners Guide"". in the 4th chapter, they start using Doctrine. The thing is that I'd like to use Zend's built-in functionality with database interactions.</p>

<p>I've searched the web and watched couple of tuts. Well I couldn't find the right (for me) solution. </p>

<p>in all tuts, everyone is using standard Zend's structure. I'd like to integrate my Modules. So I have a file structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>application
   /modules
      /moduleName
          /controllers
          /models
          /views
</code></pre>

<p>I have set up the routes in application.ini for controllers and views like this:</p>

<pre><code>; /articles/* route
resources.router.routes.articles.route = /articles
resources.router.routes.articles.defaults.module = content
resources.router.routes.articles.defaults.controller = articles
resources.router.routes.articles.defaults.action = index  
</code></pre>

<p>Now I tried to load-up my models so I start interacting with the tables in Mysql.</p>

<p>in my controller named <code>ArticlesController.php</code> I created the class <code>Content_ArticlesController</code> and in there I have: </p>

<pre><code>  public function indexAction()
  {

      $model = new Content_ArticlesModel();
      $this-&gt;view-&gt;modelHi = $model-&gt;there;
      $this-&gt;view-&gt;hello = 'Hello there';

  }
</code></pre>

<p>As you might guess Content_ArticlesModel is my class that extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract class. in there I have a public function modelHi() that I'd like to call from my Controller to pass the data from the model to the view.</p>

<p>Can someone help me do this in the right way? how should I correctly load-up my models for my modules? and maybe you could link some good article on working with database based on some example.</p>

<p>EDIT: Ok, I had this really studip error in my Controller but it's ok. Anyways the problem is that when Zend loads-up my controller it displays: <code>Fatal error: Class 'Content_ArticlesModel' not found in S:\xampp\htdocs\testsite\application\modules\content\controllers\ArticlesController.php on line 12</code></p>

<p>The issue is my Zend can't locate/doesn't know where to find the models of my module that I'm trying to reach from my controller.</p>

<p>I want to know how should I make Zend see and use my models?</p>

<p>I'm attempting to build a completely dynamic api with ASP.NET MVC 4. 
My database is abstracted by LINQ to SQL</p>

<p>My repository class receives an array that represents a rest query, for example
<code>http://myUrl.com/countries/states/suburbs/24/street/</code><br>
turns into the array<br>
<code>[countries,states,suburbs,24,street]</code></p>

<p>I want my repository to then turn that array into something like this (this is pseudo code):<br>
<code>context.countries.select(""states"").select(""suburbs"").where(""suburbs.ID == 24"").select(""street"")</code></p>

<p>My idea is to loop through the array with a constant object outside of the array with the latest object its up to.</p>

<pre><code>object currentContextObj = null;
            object currentUrlPart = null;
            IQueryable&lt;object&gt; queryResult = null;

            for (int i = 0; i &lt; urlArray.Count(); i++)
            {
</code></pre>

<p>I use reflection to understand on the context to figure out the first bit of the array.  </p>

<pre><code>if (currentContextObj == null)
                {
                    if (currentUrlPart.GetType() != typeof(string))
                        throw new ArgumentException(""URL part '"" + currentUrlPart + ""' is invalid"");

                    currentContextObj = ((IEnumerable&lt;object&gt;)context.GetType().GetProperty((string)currentUrlPart).GetValue(context, null)).AsQueryable();
                }
</code></pre>

<p>It then exits the loop, the next time around i run a select statement with dynamic linq</p>

<pre><code>else if (currentUrlPart.GetType() == typeof(string))
                {

                    currentContextObj = ((IQueryable)currentContextObj).Select((string)currentUrlPart).AsQueryable();

                }
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine, until it loops through again, on the third part of the array the currentContextObj isnt a queryable, its a data query, if i hover over it when debugging it shows the generated sql statement, so when i run that same <code>((IQueryable)currentContextObj).Select((string)currentUrlPart).AsQueryable();</code> it errors:
<code>No property or field 'Suburbs' exists in type 'EntitySet 1'</code>.</p>

<p>I am using dynamic linq because the types are all anonymous. My other attempt tried to find the select method of the enumerable class and invoke it on the currentContextObj. that didnt work because the currentContextObj was attempting to cast to an enumerable when it was a table and i couldnt cast to table because i dont know T until runtime.</p>

<p><strong>I understand this is a lot of information but I will list out what I am asking:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Should I be doing .select().select().where().select()... etc or should i be going .join().join().where().select()</li>
<li>Is it possible to avoid this problem i am having with the error for dynamic LINQ?</li>
<li>Is there an alternate solution to this problem?</li>

<p>This function calls its web service wich does return true. The problem is that inside the following callUpdateGrid, the logging shows that that web service method is not getting called from the $.ajax call:</p>

The first one, when seen as a list, looks like this:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The columns are 'Species','Longitude' and 'Latitude'.
They are observations made in the field.
<br>
The other file is also a CSV file. A test made to resemble the real thing. It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>{'y': '58.1', 'x': '22.1', 'temp': '14'}
{'y': '58.2', 'x': '22.2', 'temp': '10'}
{'y': '58.3', 'x': '22.3', 'temp': '1'}
{'y': '58.4', 'x': '22.4', 'temp': '12'}

<p>Both of the files are very long indeed. </p>

<p>I have the observation, and now I want to find the closest lower number in the file containing climatic data, and then append that line to the other one, so the output becomes:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I tried creating nested loops by iterating through the CSV files using <code>DictReader</code>, but it gets very nested very fast. And it will take a tremendous amount of loops to get through the whole thing.<br> 
Does anybody know of a method?</p>

<p>The code I have at the moment is poor, but I tried looping in several ways and I expect there is something fundamentally wrong with my entire approach. </p>

<pre><code>import csv
fil = csv.DictReader(open(""TestData.csv""), delimiter=';')

occu = csv.DictReader(open(navn), delimiter='\t')

for row in fil:
    print 'x=',row['x']
    for line in occu:
        print round(float(line['decimalLongitude']),1)
        if round(float(line['decimalLongitude']),1) == row['x']:
            print 'You did it, found one dam match'

To measure the performance, I am running a test program that publishes say 10,000 messages using one of the message queue implementations and running another process in the same machine to consume these 10,000 messages. Then I record time difference between the first message published and the last message received. </p>

<p>Following are the settings I used for the comparison.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>RabbitMQ</code>: I used a ""fanout"" type exchange and a queue with default configuration. I used the RabbitMQ C client library.</li>
<li><code>ZeroMQ</code>: My publisher publises to <code>tcp://localhost:port1</code> with <code>ZMQ_PUSH</code> socket, My broker listens on <code>tcp://localhost:port1</code> and resends the message to tcp://localhost:port2 and my consumer listens on <code>tcp://localhost:port2</code> using <code>ZMQ_PULL</code> socket. I am using a broker instead of peer to to peer communication in <code>ZeroMQ</code> to to make the performance comparison fair to other message queue implementation that uses brokers.</li>
<li><code>Qpid</code> C++ message broker: I used a ""fanout"" type exchange and a queue with default configuration. I used the Qpid C++ client library.</li>
</ol>

<p>Following is the performance result:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>RabbitMQ</code>: it takes about 1 second to receive 10,000 messages.</li>
<li><code>ZeroMQ</code>: It takes about 15 milli seconds to receive 10,000 messages.</li>
<li><code>Qpid</code>:  It takes about 4 seconds to receive 10,000 messages.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Have anyone run similar performance comparison between the message queues? Then I like to compare my results with yours.</li>
<li>Is there any way I could tune <code>RabbitMQ</code> or <code>Qpid</code> to make it performance better? </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<li>money (an Double with default value 100)</li>
<li>formatter (default value new DecimalFormat(""#,##0.00""))</li>

<p>I retrieve two records from database:</p>

<ul>
<li>""\""Hello \"" + $P{name}""</li>
<li>""\""I have \"" + $P{formatter}.format($P{money}) + \"" dollar\""""</li>
</ul>

<p>I pass these two records to JasperReport and expect to display</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello World<br>
  I have 100.00 dollar</p>

<p>However, the expressions are not evaluated and the output becomes this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Hello "" + $P{name}<br>
  ""I have "" + $P{formatter}.format($P{money}) + "" dollar""</p>

<p>Since the record number is dynamic, I have to put them in Details band. The tricky part is that each record may have different parameters.</p>

<p>Basically my MVC structure logs each request that user makes. So if user goes to index page or does ajax call, everything is being logged in my table but the problem was that on each request it was logging <strong>2 records</strong> and could not understand why.</p>

<p>Later I added some debugging <strong>var_dumps</strong> and found out that the second log is actually for file request: <strong>/favicon.ico</strong></p>

<p>How would I ignore this in my router so that it does not make the log of this kind of file requests and just load the file. I do need favicon.ico and want to use it but dont want it to be part of <strong>request</strong> and dont want to log it on each request.</p>

<p>Every page hit records 2 rows right now, 1 row is correct and second row is for favicon.ico.</p>

<p>Please help if anyone had the same issue.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Note that If I add some favicon.ico in my root folder then it makes only 1 request. So if i dont have favicon.icon then it makes 2 requests. Is it possible to check if favicon.ico does not exist dont make extra request.</p>

<p>As for requested here is my log code in my FrontController:</p>

<pre><code>if ($user-&gt;isLoggedIn()) {
   $m_useractivity = ModelFactory::Create(array('userActivity', $user-&gt;getUID()));
   $log_id = $m_useractivity-&gt;logActivity($user-&gt;getUID(), $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], $a, $p, $request-&gt;getParams(), $request-&gt;browser(), $request-&gt;browserVersion(), $request-&gt;platform(), '', $request-&gt;ip(), $request-&gt;referer(), $request-&gt;getRequestMethod(), $request-&gt;type());

If I evoke the following however:</p>

<p>the keyboard does show, so it's probably not the delegation but actually detecting whether it's been clicked... I do not want it to edit on load though, and only by request...</p>

<p>Initial code</p>

<pre><code>cudaMemcpy((void *)(data + stride), (void *)d_output, sizeof(unsigned int) * rows * cols, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
thrust::device_vector&lt;unsigned int&gt; vec((data + stride), (data + stride + (rows * cols)));
sum = thrust::reduce(vec.begin(), vec.end());
</code></pre>

<p>The above code works perfectly fine. But if I change it to</p>

<pre><code>thrust::device_ptr&lt;unsigned int&gt; outputPtrBegin(d_output);
thrust::device_ptr&lt;unsigned int&gt; outputPtrEnd((d_output + stride + (rows * cols)));
sum = thrust::reduce(outputPtrBegin, outputPtrEnd);

<p>It throws me the following error.</p>

<pre><code> terminate called after throwing an instance of 'thrust::system::system_error'
 what():  an illegal memory access was encountered

<p>What could be the problem?
Thanks a lot for your time.</p>

<p>*Edited input from Robert Crovella
The mistake was using stride.
I have a following question (related to the above declaration)</p>

<p>Depending on the value of toggle, I need to call thrust</p>

<pre><code>if(toggle) {
    thrust::device_ptr&lt;unsigned int&gt; outputPtrBegin(d_output);
    thrust::device_ptr&lt;unsigned int&gt; outputPtrEnd((d_output + (rows * cols)));
}
else {
    thrust::device_ptr&lt;unsigned int&gt; outputPtrBegin(d_X);
    thrust::device_ptr&lt;unsigned int&gt; outputPtrEnd((d_X + (rows * cols)));
}
</code></pre>

<p>But the compilation says outputPtrBegin and outputPtrEnd are not declared, because they are in the if statement. How do I declare these device pointers before and then use?</p>

<p>Initially I - </p>

<ol>
<li>Downloaded the latest Sencha SDK and it created a <em>touch-2.1.1</em> folder.</li>
<li>Downloaded and installed latest Sencha SDK tools 2.0.0 - Beta 3.</li>
<li>Downloaded and installed latest Sencha Cmd 3.1.0.256 for mac in the default path it was showing i.e. Users/[User-name]/bin</li>
</ol>

<p>After this I navigated to the touch-2.1.1 folder in the terminal and typed ""sencha"" to check if it was working. I got the following error - </p>

<blockquote>

<p>After this I googled around and found that ONLY Sencha Cmd is needed and not Sencha SDK Tools. So I deleted the Sencha SDK Tools from /Applications <em>(I am ashamed of this step)</em></p>

<p>I navigated to /Users/administrator/bin/Sencha/Cmd/3.1.0.256 and gave the command - </p>

<blockquote>

<p>And i was punished with </p>

<p>After that I've been trying different solutions like one mentioned <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14399139/install-sencha-touch-2-1-on-mac"">HERE</a>, but its still not working.</p>

<p>Can anyone help pls.</p>

<p><strong>PS-</strong></p>

<p>I've removed Sencha SDK tools but i'm still getting the folder reference when i do <strong>echo $PATH</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>/Applications/SenchaSDKTools-2.0.0-beta3:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin</p>

<p>I did <strong>PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin</strong>, and checked the $PATH again then sdk tools were removed. I closed the terminal, reopened it and gave echo $PATH...this time again I could see the SDK tools path in the $PATH. </p>

<pre><code>Game(id, name, year)
Devs(pid, gid, role)

<p>Where Game.id is a primary key, and where Devs.gid is a foreign key to Game.id.</p>

<p>In a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29787954/select-only-largest-values-in-a-sql-relation"">previous post I made here</a>, another user was kind enough to help me out in creating a query that finds all games made with the most developers making that game. His answer used a WITH statement, and I am not very familiar with these as I'm only a few weeks into learning SQL. Here's the working query:</p>

<pre><code>WITH GamesDevs (GameName, DevsCount)
AS
(
    SELECT Game.name AS GameName, count(DISTINCT Devs.pid) AS DevsCount
    FROM Game, Devs
    WHERE Devs.gid=Game.id

)

SELECT * FROM GamesDevs WHERE GamesDevs.DevsCount = (SELECT MAX(DevsCount) FROM GamesDevs)

<p>For the sole purpose of getting more familiar with SQL, I am trying to rewrite this query using a subquery instead of a WITH statement. I've been using <a href=""http://oracle-base.com/articles/misc/with-clause.php"" rel=""nofollow"">this Oracle documentation</a> to help me figure it out. I tried rewriting the query like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM (SELECT Game.name AS GameName, count(DISTINCT Devs.pid) AS DevsCount
    FROM Game, Devs

<p>As far as I can tell, these two queries should be identical. However, when I try running the second query, I get the error </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Msg 207, Level 16, State 1, Line 6 Invalid column name 'DevsCount'.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why I might be getting this error, or why these two queries wouldn't be identical?</p>

But now, I'm programming a ""linked Class"" in c++.
My Parent-Class ""GAME"" should have a variable number of Elements. And each Element is a class.
So I programmed this:</p>

<pre><code>class GAME : public LEVEL
{  private:
     ELEMENT *startPointer;
   public:
     GAME()
     {    startPointer=NULL;
     }
     initGame()
     {    p=aStartPointer;
          while(p!=NULL);//This loop is based on a linked list, so its dynamic
          {   startPointer=new ELEMENT(startPointer);
              p=p-&gt;next;
          }
     }
}


class ELEMENT
{   private:
        ELEMENT *next;
    public:
        ELEMENT(ELEMENT* nextPointer)
        {    next=nextPointer;
        }
}

<p>My Problem: I never heard about a linked class before, and I'm not sure if I should use it.<br>

<p>== EDIT 1: the steps i followed ==</p>

<p>For Openblas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Downloaded openblas from
    http://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/zipball/v0.2.14.</li>
<li>Unzipped and compiled it on my system using gcc-4.4.7 and the following command

make FC=/usr/bin/lgfortran-4.4

I had to provide 'FC' as my system is not having libgfortran.* present in /usr/lib/.</li>
<li>After compilation is done, I type
    make install
to install to a custom directory in my home folder.</li>
</ol>

<p>For suitesparse:</p>

<ol>
<li>Downloaded suitesparse from http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/SuiteSparse/SuiteSparse-4.4.4.tar.gz</li>
<li>Unzipped it, and edited the suitsparse_config.mk file to do the following modifications: A)  enabled GPU configuration for CHOLMOD and SPQR, B) Not using metis, so commented ""METIS_PATH = ../../metis-4.0"" and ""METIS = ../../metis-4.0/libmetis.a"". Also, uncommitted ""CHOLMOD_CONFIG = -DNPARTITION"". C) gave path to custom installation of openblas: BLAS = -L//OpenBLAS/local/lib/libopenblas.a -lpthread -L/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.4.7/libgfortran.so</li>

I can query the AD anytime to get the info I need so is it necessary to store it a second time in sql server?

<p>The problem is that when I start the recorder/streaming thread, it shows me that it sends one package and then the app crashes with no message. Do you have any sugestions or advices? Please help me because I need to do this project asap and I've worked hard and documented myself but still it doesn't want to work well. Thank you!</p>

<p>Edit: I've just discovered that</p>

<pre><code>//  Echo cancelling

<p>The first time you visit my <a href=""http://www.josebrowne.com/projects.html"" rel=""nofollow"">projects page</a> and filter the results everything works fine. But for some reason in Chrome whenever I filter the second time all images disappear (it sets the opacity is set to 0).</p>

<p>A couple of notes about the code:</p>

<ol>
<li>countTime is a global variable set by a dropdown menu</li>
<li>stopCount is a gloabal variable set by a reset button</li>
<li>leadZero is an external function used for formatting</li>
</ol>

<p>I understand that setTimeout is not very accurate, but I would have thought that the remTime > 0 condition would stop the recursion eventually, even if it missed the first time.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>function newCount() {
    var startTime=new Date();
    var min=startTime.getMinutes();
    var sec=startTime.getSeconds();
    var endTime=(min*60)+sec+countTime;
    stopCount=false;

    countDown();

    function countDown() {
        var today=new Date();
        var m=today.getMinutes();
        var s=today.getSeconds();
        var currTime=(m*60)+s;
        var remTime=endTime-currTime;
        var remMin = Math.floor(remTime/60);
        var remSec = remTime % 60;

        // add a zero in front of numbers&lt;10
        remMin=leadZero(remMin);
        remSec=leadZero(remSec);

        document.getElementById('timer').innerHTML=remMin+"":""+remSec;

        if (remTime &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; stopCount==false) {

<p>This website (travel-related price-comparison website) is built in java with Tapestry 5 as it's web-framework. It makes extensive use of Lucene / Solr. </p>

<p>I'm looking for a way to be able to author additional content-rich pages, which combines content to be authored in a CMS-environment while other content is highly dynamic and results from for example Solr / Lucene or Domain Object (fetched through Hibernate). </p>

<p>For now I used mysql and excel as a really crude way for a CMS. --> Have Excel-files following a specific format and import the content in mysql. The website than queries mysql for the content. </p>

<p>Obviously, this can be approved. 
I guess I'm looking for guidance at what level the integration with an existing CMS should be done. </p>

<p>options: </p>

<p>1- Loosely coupled  - PREFERRED FOR NOW -  Use a CMS based on a content-repository which follows the JSR-170 specs.  Magnolia, as well as some others come to mind here.<br>
- Simply author pages / page-snippets in Magnolia which are stored in the content repository. 
- Have a periodic program query the content-repository, extract the data and populate MYSQL like before. </p>

<p>pros: 
- website works like before, without changes</p>

<p>cons:
- no way to edit pages in-place. </p>

<p>2- Have a CMS that is customizable in such a way, that I can bring the solr / lucene functionality into the CMS. </p>

<p>pro:
- in place editing
- better editing workflow
- editing is kept in one place, etc. </p>

<p>cons: 
- needs customization to existing CMS, and probably lot's of it. But may be worth the time for us on the long run.  </p>

<p>3- Something in between? (like begin able to incorporate the inplace-editor part of a cms into our website, and saving to our existing backend) 
suggestions welcome. </p>

<p>I bet I'm not the only one having such a use-case (on a high level), and am wondering what others have done / would suggest. </p>

<p>In particular: what Java CMS do you know of that are customizable to the extent as described above. For some reason I'm liking Magnolia far better than the others I've tested briefly (Alfresco, Hippo) </p>

<p>Any help appreciated. </p>

<pre><code>print(results[1699])

tweets = gsub(""\303\272"", ""u"", tweets)

tweets = gsub(""\302\241"", """", tweets)

<p>I guess there must be a better solution. I wonder why changing the encoding makes the gsub()
function work, and why it's not working in the previous tweets.</p>

<p>I've got a button and a textview, and I want the textview to be centered in the parent view, while the button is on the right side in the parent view.</p>

<p><strong>Approach</strong></p>

<p>So I took a RelativeLayout, make the textview layout_centerHorizontal=""true"", and the button layout_alignParentRight=""true"".</p>

<p><strong>Code</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
android:layout_width=""match_parent""
android:layout_height=""wrap_content"" &gt;

    &lt;TextView
        android:id=""@+id/title_header_TV""
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_centerHorizontal=""true""
        android:text=""TextView"" /&gt;
       &lt;!--  Doesnt work --&gt;
       &lt;!--  android:layout_toLeftOf=""@+id/right_button""  --&gt;

    &lt;Button
        android:id=""@+id/right_button""
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_alignParentRight=""true""        
        android:text=""Button"" /&gt;

&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>So when the text is too long, it gets written on top of the button.</p>

<p>I tried doing layout_toLeftOf=""@+id/right_button"" on the textview, but now TextView is no longer centered.</p>

<p>Selenium is opening another browser on line 2 and not redirecting. So, its showing the url of the previous browser and not the current newly opened browser.</p>

<p>To begin with, I see I have to supply the necessary jars through the libjars methods.
After that I am pretty sure that all the jars are available to my driver code.</p>

<p>This is my workflow.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;action name=""run-workflow""&gt;
    &lt;java&gt;
      &lt;prepare&gt;
        &lt;delete path='${nameNode}/user/dhruvk/avro_output'/&gt;
      &lt;/prepare&gt;
      &lt;main-class&gt;com.dhruvk.AvroDriver&lt;/main-class&gt;
      &lt;java-opts&gt;-Dqueue=${queueName} -DinputPath=${nameNode}/user/dhruvk/avro_input -DoutputPath=${nameNode}/user/dhruvk/avro_output&lt;/java-opts&gt;
      &lt;arg&gt;-libjars&lt;/arg&gt;
      &lt;arg&gt;${nameNode}${workBasePath}/workflow/lib/joda-time-2.3.jar&lt;/arg&gt;
      &lt;arg&gt;${nameNode}${workBasePath}/workflow/lib/avro-mapred-1.7.7-hadoop2&lt;/arg&gt;
      &lt;arg&gt;${nameNode}${workBasePath}/workflow/lib/avro-1.7.7.jar&lt;/arg&gt;
    &lt;/java&gt;
    &lt;ok to=""end""/&gt;
    &lt;error to=""error""/&gt;
  &lt;/action&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this is how my driver looks:</p>

<pre><code>public class AvroDriver extends Configured implements Tool
{
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception {
      int exitCode = ToolRunner.run(new Configuration(), new AvroDriver(), args);
      System.exit(exitCode);
    }

  @Override
  public int run(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Configuration configuration = getConf();

    Job job = Job.getInstance(configuration, this.getClass().getSimpleName());
    job.setJarByClass(this.getClass());

    String inputDir = getProperty(""inputPath"");
    String outputDir = getProperty(""outputPath"");

    job.setJarByClass(AvroDriver.class);
    job.setJobName(""Color count"");
    FileInputFormat.addInputPath(job, new Path(inputDir));
    FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath(job, new Path(outputDir));

    job.setInputFormatClass(AvroKeyInputFormat.class);
    job.setMapperClass(ColorCountMapper.class);
    AvroJob.setInputKeySchema(job, User.getClassSchema());
    job.setMapOutputKeyClass(Text.class);
    job.setMapOutputValueClass(IntWritable.class);

    job.setNumReduceTasks(0);

    return job.waitForCompletion(true) ? 0 : 1;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I was really not sure why the class is not available to this, as an experiment I changed packing to be <strong>jar-with-dependencies</strong> from maven assembly plugin.</p>

<p>I guess that since I have following dependencies: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.avro&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;avro&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.7.7&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.avro&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;avro-mapred&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.7.7&lt;/version&gt;
      &lt;classifier&gt;hadoop2&lt;/classifier&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;

    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;joda-time&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;joda-time&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;2.3&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;

    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.hadoop&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;hadoop-common&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;2.5.0-cdh5.3.2&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.hadoop&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;hadoop-mapreduce-client-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;2.5.0-cdh5.3.2&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this resolved the first issue of missing <code>AvroKeyInputFormat</code>.</p>

<p>However I don't think this is a good solution and would like to understand more about the issue and better solution.</p>

<p>Doing this however brought me to another problem which I had lesser time debugging:</p>

These bitmaps will all have the same image file. However, I want a random amount of them to fall infinitely (until the game is ""over""). My problem now is coming up with the algorithm to detect the catching of these randomly produced bitmaps. I can register a catch when I have just one image falling, but I don't know how I'll implement multiple images falling and be able to implement collision detection. So far, I came up with two ideas. One of them is to have a queue, and each falling object gets put in the queue when it is created. The program will only ever detect if the box has caught the object in the first position of the queue. If it (a) is caught or ( reaches a certain point on the screen, that object will then be dequeued. The other idea I had is more of a question - am I able to create a class for this falling Object, and have a method inside it that handles the collisions? One that is always listening for a collision whenever a new instance of that class is created? </p>

<p>I have a solution structured in the following way.</p>

<ul>
<li>Entity framework project</li>
<li>Data access project</li>
<li>WPF application project</li>
</ul>

<p>The WPF application calls methods in the data access project which gets it's data from the entity framework project and binds it in XAML. </p>

<p>e.g. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl.Resources&gt;
      &lt;ObjectDataProvider x:Key=""tokens"" 
                            ObjectType=""{x:Type ctl:MerchantNetworkController}"" 
                            MethodName=""ListMerchantNetworkTokens"" /&gt;
&lt;/UserControl.Resources&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem i have is that the VS 2008 designer won't load when i call functions from the data access project, I can however compile and run the solution fine. </p>

<p>When i create a function in the code behind of the XAML and use that instead of the data access project it works fine and the designer actually loads. The problem just occurs when i make a call to the data access project.</p>

<p>The error message i get from the designer is</p>

<pre><code>""The specified named connection is either not found in the configuration, not intended to be used with the EntityClient provider, or not valid""
</code></pre>

<p>I have the following connection string in the App.config of the WPF project and the data access project</p>

<pre><code>&lt;add name=""Entities""
     connectionString=""metadata=C:\EFModel\Model.csdl|C:\EFModel\Model.ssdl|C:\EFModel\Model.msl;
         provider=System.Data.SqlClient;
         provider connection string='Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=database;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=username;Password=password;MultipleActiveResultSets=True'""

"27549402","1","","","2014-12-18 14:56:47","","1","136","<p>I know a lot of questions on these topics have been asked before, but I have a specific case where speed is (moderately) important and the speed increase when using function pointers rather than virtual functions is about 25%. I wondered (for mostly academic reasons) why?
To give more detail, I am writing a simulation which consists of a series of Cells. The Cells are connected by Links which dictate the interactions between the Cells. The Link class has a virtual function called update(), which causes the two Cells it is linking to interact. It is virtual so that I can create different types of Links to give different types of interactions. For example, at the moment I am simulating inviscid flow, but I may want a link which has viscosity or applies a boundary condition.
The second way I can achieve the same affect is to pass a function pointer to the Link class and make the target of the function pointer a friend. I can now have a non-virtual update() which uses the function pointer. Derived classes can use pointers to different functions giving polymorphic behaviour.</p>

<p>When I build the two versions and profile with Very Sleepy, I find that the function pointer version is significantly faster than the virtual function version and that it appears that the Link class has been entirely optimised away - I just see calls from my main function to the functions pointed to.</p>

<p>I just wondered what made it easier for my compiler (MSVC++ 2012 Express) to optimise the function pointer case better than the virtual function case?</p>

<p>Some code below if it helps for the function pointer case, I'm sure it is obvious how the equivalent would be done with virtual functions.</p>

<pre><code>void InviscidLinkUpdate( void * linkVoid )
{
    InviscidLink * link=(InviscidLink*)linkVoid;
    //do some stuff with the link
    //e.g.
    //link-&gt;param1=
}

void ViscousLinkUpdate( void * linkVoid )
{
    ViscousLink * link=(ViscousLink*)linkVoid;
    //do some stuff with the link
    //e.g.
    //link-&gt;param1=
}

class Link
{
public:
    Link(Cell *cell1, Cell*cell2, float area, float timeStep, void (*updateFunc)( void * ))
        :m_cell1(cell1), m_cell2(cell2), m_area(area), m_timeStep(timeStep), m_update(updateFunc)
    ~Link(){};
    void update() {m_update( this );}
protected:
    void (*const m_update)( void *, UNG_FLT );
    Cell *m_cell1;
    Cell *m_cell2;
    float m_area;
    float m_timeStep
    //some other parameters I want to modify in update()
    float param1;
    float param2;

};

class InviscidLink : public Link
{
    friend void InviscidLinkUpdate( void * linkVoid )
public:
    InviscidLink(Cell *cell1, Cell*cell2, float area, float timeStep)
        Link(cell1, cell2, area, timeStep, InvicedLinkUpdate)
    {}
};

class ViscousLink : public Link
{
    friend void ViscousLinkUpdate( void * linkVoid )
public:
    ViscousLink(Cell *cell1, Cell*cell2, float area, float timeStep)

<p>edit</p>

<p>I have now put the full source on GitHub - <a href=""https://github.com/philrosenberg/ung"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/philrosenberg/ung</a>
Compare commit 5ca899d39aa85fa3a86091c1202b2c4cd7147287 (the function pointer version) with commit aff249dbeb5dfdbdaefc8483becef53053c4646f (the virtual function version). Unfortunately I based the test project initially on a wxWidgets project in case I wanted to play with some graphical display so if you don't have wxWidgets then you will need to hack it into a command line project to compile it.
I used Very Sleepy to benchmark it</p>

<p>further edit:</p>

<p>milianw's comment about profile guided optimization turned out to be the solution, but as a comment I currently cannot mark it as the answer. Using the pro version of Visual Studio with the profile guided optimization gave similar runtimes as using inline functions. I guess this is the Virtual Call Speculation described at <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e7k32f4k.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e7k32f4k.aspx</a>. I still find it a bit odd that this code could be more easily optimized using function pointers instead of virtual functions, but I guess that is why everyone advises to TEST, rather than assume certain code is faster than another.</p>

<p>We actually don't think it is the code but rather permissions of TeamCity when running the Pre-build Event.  We are testing using TeamCity PowerShell build step, but would like to keep this as an ""in project"" step so there is not TeamCity dependency.</p>

<p>I'll update this issue with result of PowerShell build step.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Since I want my menu to be equally spaced on the screen (using autolayout tricks on the <a href=""http://effortlesscode.com/evenly-spacing-views-auto-layout/"" rel=""nofollow"">Storyboard</a>), I have created a custom class with this menu that i'm adding to the center part of the main controller view. The problem is that the menu doesn't fit in small screen (3,5"" screens).</p>

<p>Trying to solve this problem, I have created a scrollView in the main screen to add the menu and be able to scroll in small screens.</p>

<p>The problem is that since the view I'm loading in the scrollview, automatically fits to the size of the container (in this case the UIScrollView), only a small part of the menu is appearing in the 3,5"" screen, without the option of scrolling (In bigger views it appears equally spaced and everything appears correctly).</p>

<p>How can I solve this UIScrollView problem? Or there is a better solution for this problem?</p>

<p>How can otherRect (which is a interface) be casted to a RectanglePlus. The confusion is, RectanglePlus is a <strong>class</strong> having variables, which are not present in the otherRect which is an <strong>interface</strong></p>

I also tried the opposite, injecting and using the JPA database properties in the Neo4j configuration (also just to narrow down on the issue, not for actual use) and it did trigger the same issue.
This leads me to think the issue lies with my Neo4j configuration class that cannot handle properties injection.</p>

I want the pathname to change for the file based on the contents of the page it's on. I would assume that this would be as simple as passing the ajax query some parameter, but I can't find this anywhere in the documentation. I mean, it must exist, right?</p>

<p>If this doesn't exist for jQuery File Uploader (!?), is there a file uploading plugin that will be cross-browser compatible, work properly, and support this feature? Honestly, jQuery File Uploader comes with a lot of bells and whistles that I don't necessarily need so I'm open to a suggestion for something simpler.</p>

<p>if I go to A, then to B, then to C and go back to B, when I return to C it appears faster the second time. I suppose all C are being cached or stored somehow. The problem with this is that, for example, C calls a UIImagePickerController the first time it enters but not the second one. Why?</p>

<p>The UIImagePickerController is presented inside C's viewDidLoad, by a line like</p>

<p>[self.navigationController presentModalViewController:picker animated:YES];</p>

<p>but obviously, if C is being ""cached"" viewDidLoad will not run the second time, and this is why the picker is not being called, except for the first time. </p>

<p>I like the idea of a cached VC, because it is fast as hell to go back and forward, but, where should I put the call to the picker, so it is called correctly? I thought it would be viewWillAppear, but I tried that and this method is never called.</p>

option and start the application everything works fine: </p>

<p>The panel is displayed in front of everything else and when 
the mouse cursor hovers over the panel's edges it changes from a normal 
arrow-cursor to the appropriate resize-cursor, so the user knows that he can resize
the panel.</p>

<p>This works fine as longs as I don't click on any other application 
as for example Safari or Finder.</p>

<p>From the moment I once give focus to another application, 
I can click on and hover over my panel as much as I want, the
cursor style will not change anymore - it always stays an arrow and it's not possible to return to the normal behavior. </p>

<p>The panel stays selectable and in the front, you still can move and resize it, 
but the mouse cursor stays an arrow all the time. You then cannot even change it
manually using something like: <code>[[NSCursor crosshairCursor] set]</code>.</p>

<p>So I need to find a way to create a <code>NSPanel</code> that keeps the normal
automatic-change-cursorstyle-when-hovering-over-panel-edges-behaviour
even when you give focus to another application.</p>

<p>I have already tried to use an customized <code>NSPanel</code>-class,
where I have overwritten the  <code>canBecomeKeyWindow</code> and 
<code>canBecomeMainWindow</code> methods, so that they return YES
but even when I make my Panel <code>KeyWindow</code> and <code>MainWindow</code>... </p>

<pre><code>[myPanel makeKeyAndOrderFront:self];
[myPanel makeMainWindow];
</code></pre>

<p>...it doesn't solve the cursor issue.</p>

<p>Would be great if someone could help me here :)</p>

<p>PS.: the Base SDK and the Deployment Target are set to 10.8 in my project</p>

<hr>

<p>So I found out that the described issue has nothing to to with the panel's window-state. It really doesn't matter if it is set to key or to main, instead the cursor-problem (stays arrow all the time)is related to the application's activation state. </p>

<p>Everything works fine as long as the application that owns the panel is active but if you click on another application my application is deactivated and does not get activated again - even if you click on the panel - because the ""<code>non-activating</code>""-option is enabled. </p>

<p>The problem is that i need the ""<code>non activating</code>""-option because  I am creating a status-bar-screen-capturing app that should be displayed and operate in front of everything else but without deactivating any running application. I could solve the cursor problem by </p>

<p><code>[NSApp activateIgnoringOtherApps];</code> </p>

<p>but then taking a screenshot of a fullscreen video running in Safari would deactivate Safari and minimize the video, which I don't want.  </p>

<p>In order to do this, I have tried LogMeIn Hamachi2 to create a P2P VPN and use RoboCopy to copy the files, however it seems Hamachi doesn't work on Windows EC2.</p>

<p>What is your solution for deploying your .NET apps to Windows EC2 instances? I want to avoid running an FTP server on the box just to get my files up on the server and don't have a VPN server (like OpenVPN) running to run a cloud based VPN solution.</p>

<p>I cant determine whether the data structure is created wrong or if I am referencing it the wrong way. I used gdb but as its in the main function with no parameters I am not able to deduce anything.</p>

<p>Well the seg fault is after printing iter 2.
So, how can I determine whether the attibute_struct defined is correct and with 8 level of depth or whether I am referencing a NULL object?
Using if(current_head == NULL) cout &lt;&lt; ""Error""; inside the while loop does not help.</p>

In my post view, I have got a button called <code>Delete Permanently</code> for which I have used the permission <code>blog.remove</code>. I want to show this button only if <code>Sentry::getUser()-&gt;hasAnyAccess(array('blog', 'blog.remove'))</code>:</p>

<pre><code>@if (Sentry::getUser()-&gt;hasAnyAccess(array('blog', 'blog.remove')))
    &lt;a class=""btn btn-danger"" href=""{{URL::to('post/delete/' . $post-&gt;id)}}""&gt;Delete Permanently&lt;/a&gt;
@endif
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I login using the <code>admin@admin.com</code>, it works fine that is remove button is shown as expected, because the <code>admin</code> has the access to <code>blog</code> permission. But, when I login using <code>user@user.com</code>, the button is not being shown. What is the reason that the button is not being shown although I have assigned the permission of <code>blog.remove</code> to <code>user@user.com</code>. Also I did a <code>var_dump(..)</code> and it's return <code>false</code>. Can any one please tell me what's wrong with my implementation? Why is the removal button not being shown for the <code>user@user.com</code> user?</p>

<p>I have been tweaking the speex encoding and decoding classes to get a optimum voice quality with no luck. And have been searching the speex class for any AEC that I can possible access and implement, no luck here as well, but the speex documentation mentions about the AEC in C++, but not clear how to implement in C#.
I'm new to c# development, please guide, if possible point me to a direction which will help me implement this AEC and increase the voice qaulity. I appreciate any guidance. Thanks</p>

<p>This answer is great as it provides me with an answer as to what I was trying to do. However, I am quite new and dont fully understand how it exactly works. I do understand the hash, but I do not understand how the author constructed his code below the hash. I have tried to slim this code down and test it line by line, however it doesn't work when I do that. I'm just trying to figure out why/how they are performing things like <code>int/num</code> and using their method <code>in_words</code> in the middle of their block code. </p>

<p>If anyone has the available time to break this down step by step and explain how this code works, I would be greatly appreciative. NOTE: I would have just commented on the original authors solution but I was not allowed to as I did not have enough 'reputation' to do so.</p>

<ul>
<li>Using a custom <code>SKShader</code> using GLES 2.0.</li>
<li>Using Core Image filters.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've tried to add a custom SKShader that should modify the whole screen by pixelating it. I'm not sure that if it's possible, but documentation from <code>SKScene</code> (which is a subclass of <code>SKEffectNode</code>) suggests it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An SKEffectNode object renders its children into a buffer and
  optionally applies a Core Image filter to this rendered output.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's possible to assign a SKShader to the SKScene, as in <code>GameScene : SKScene</code>:</p>

<pre><code>override func didMoveToView(view: SKView) {
    let shader = SKShader(fileNamed: ""pixelation.fsh"")
    self.shader = shader
    self.shouldEnableEffects = true
}
</code></pre>

<p>... but it seems that the rendered buffer is not passed as the u_texture to the GLES: </p>

<pre><code>void main()
{
    vec2 coord = v_tex_coord;
    coord.x = floor(coord.x * 10.0) / 10.0;
    coord.y = floor(coord.y * 10.0) / 10.0;
    vec4 texture = texture2D(u_texture, coord);
    gl_FragColor = texture;
}
</code></pre>

<p>... so the previous shader doesn't work.</p>

<p>If I assign that shader to a texture-based <code>SKSpriteNode</code>, it works.</p>

<p>So is it possible to modify the whole frame buffer (and for example pixelate it) as a post-processing measure after all the nodes have been rendered?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I found a way to do the pixelation using Core Image filters in OS X (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24659725/how-do-you-add-a-cipixellate-core-image-filter-to-a-sprite-kit-scene/24659726?noredirect=1#comment40852930_24659726"">How do you add a CIPixellate Core Image Filter to a Sprite Kit scene?</a>), but copying that implementation doesn't yield any results on iOS.

attribute vec4 a_position;
attribute vec2 a_texPos;

varying vec2 v_texPos;

void main{
v_texPos=a_texPos;

}

<p>I will post a screenshot of Logcat displaying nothing but the phrase ""Vertex shader error"" debug message. The GL_INVALID_OPERATION is caused by the vertex shader status being 0, was deleted and returned back to the onSurfaceCreated(), and not being able to point to the matrix location, as the vertex shader is nonexistent at that point in time.</p>

The idea is that the service should manage sub-components and be pluggable, where any number of new components can be introduced at runtime without having to go through a full service recompile and deploy scenario.  The components should be pluggable, meaning that as soon as I drop an output assembly into a designated folder on disc, the Windows Service should say ""Hey, here's a new component to run..."" and just do it's thing.  That's the power of MEF.  Very cool stuff so far.</p>

<p>I understand the concept of creating an AggregateCatalog and a CompositionContainer to import all available sub-components (assemblies).  This is all good, and it works as expected when the Windows Service is intially started up.  However, I'm eventually going to be introducing new components at runtime, so at some point I'm going to need the CompositionContainer to recognize any new output assemblies that are added. </p>

<p>My concern with the following is any implications on performance.  Is it safe / efficient to put the CompositionContainer logic into a loop such as the following:</p>

<pre><code>        [ImportMany(AllowRecomposition = true)]
        private IEnumerable&lt;Lazy&lt;IMySubComponentTask, IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;&gt;&gt;                        
        MySubComponentTasks { get; set; }

        while (true)
        {
          //Create a general aggregate catalog
          var catalog = new AggregateCatalog();

          //Adds all the parts found in the same assembly as the Program class
          catalog.Catalogs.Add(new AssemblyCatalog(typeof(MySubComponentTaskFactory).Assembly));

          //Create a new directory catalog
          var directoryCatalog = new DirectoryCatalog(@"".\Extensions"");

          //Add the DLLs in the directory to the aggregate catalog
          catalog.Catalogs.Add(directoryCatalog);

          //Create the current composition container to create the parts
          var container = new CompositionContainer(catalog);

          //Fill the imports of this object
          try
          {
            container.ComposeParts(this);
          }
          catch (CompositionException compositionException)

<p>I then used PowerShell script to parse the file. Thanks to TheMadTechnician.</p>

<pre><code>(Get-Content C:\Path\To\File.txt) -join ""`r`n"" -Split ""(?m)^(?=\S)"" |
    Where{$_} | 
    ForEach{
        Clear-Variable Files,Driver,Name,HardwareID
        $Files = @()
        $HardwareID = ($_ -split ""`r`n"")[0].trim()
        Switch -regex ($_ -split ""`r`n""){
            ""^\s+Name:"" {$Name = ($_ -split ':',2)[-1].trim();Continue}
            ""^\s+.:\\"" {$Files += $_.trim();continue}
            ""^\s+Driver"" {$Driver = [RegEx]::Matches($_,""(?&lt;=Driver installed from )(.+?)(?= \[)"").value;continue}
        }
        [PSCustomObject]@{'HardwareID' = $HardwareID;'Name' = $Name; 'Files' = $Driver; 'FileVersion' = If(Test-Path $_.Trim()){[System.Diagnostics.FileVersionInfo]::GetVersionInfo($_.trim()).FileVersion}}
    $Files | ForEach{ [PSCustomObject]@{'HardwareID' = $HardwareID;'Name' = $Name; 'Files' = $_; 'FileVersion' = If(Test-Path $_.Trim()){[System.Diagnostics.FileVersionInfo]::GetVersionInfo($_.trim()).FileVersion}Else{'File Not Found'}}}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the output after running the script is:</p>

<p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></p>

<p>I would like to add an extra column with driver version. </p>

<p>How can I find the driver version and list it next to the name column? Thank you!</p>

<p>The code below parses driver version from the INF file. 
I am not experienced with PowerShell, so how can I used this bit of information and incorporate it with the above code to add an extra column and list driver version; preferably, next to Name column.</p>

<pre><code>$pattern = 'DriverVer\s*=\s*(?:\d+/\d+/\d+,)?(.*)'
Select-String -Pattern $pattern -Path $path |
  select -Expand Matches -First 1 |
  % { $_.Groups[1].Value }

somedomain.biz
mydomain.co
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Redirect:<em></strong> with this one, php uses the ',' so we are left with the ip, and the domainkey as seperate strings, the ip can be 2-3 numbers per section!, so ###.##.##.###, or even ##.##.##.##, and the domain key is a varchar(not so important)</em></p>

<pre><code>##.##.##.##, domainkey
###.###.###.###, domainkey

What I have been doing so far has been converting the sequence to a set, and then back to the original sequence. Conversion to the set gets rid of the duplicates, and then I convert back into the set. However, this is very slow, as I'm given to understand that when converting to set, every pair of elements is compared, and the makes the complexity O(n^2), which is not acceptable. And since I have access to a computer with thousands of cores (through my university), I was wondering whether making things parallel would help.</p>

<p>Initially I thought I'd use scala Futures to parallelize the code in the following manner. Group the elements of the sequence into smaller subgroups by their hash code. That way, I have a subcollection of the original sequence, such that no element appears in two different subcollections and and every element is covered. Now I convert these smaller subcollections to sets, and back to sequences and concatenate them. This way I'm guaranteed to get a sequence with no repeats.</p>

<p>But I was wondering if applying the toSet method on a parallel sequence already does this. I thought I'd test this out in the scala interpreter, but I got roughly the same time for the conversion to parallel set vs the conversion to the non parallel set.
I was hoping someone could tell me whether conversion to parallel sets works this way or not. I'd be much obliged. Thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT: Is performing a toSet on a parallel collection faster than performing toSet on a non parallel collection?</p>

  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/138521/is-it-feasible-to-compile-python-to-machine-code"">Is it feasible to compile Python to machine code?</a>  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Is it possible to compile Python code (plus its dependencies, plus the interpreter library) into <strong>a single, <em>native</em></strong> Windows executable (with <em>nothing</em> else bundled along with it) from a Python file? (Kind of like how the GNU compiler for Java compiles Java into a <em>native</em> (humongous) executable, which contains everything in true machine code.)</p>

<p>If so, how would I go about doing this?</p>

<p>(Specifically, <code>py2exe</code> does <em>not</em> do what I want -- it includes the libraries inside a <em>separate</em> ZIP file, and it includes the interpreter as a <em>separate</em> DLL.)</p>

<h3>Note 1:</h3>

<p>To emphasize, I'm <strong><em>not</em></strong> asking for a ""self-extracting archive"", an ""executable packer"", or some other way of 'cheating' by bundling the files inside an <code>exe</code> -- I'm looking for something that genuinely converts Python into a native executable, like what GCJ does for Java.</p>

<h3>Note 2:</h3>

<p>Only if the above <em>isn't</em> possible:</p>

<p>Is it possible to at least generate a <em>single</em> executable from a Python code containing the interpreter bundled along with all the library dependencies, such that the resulting executable does <em>not</em> need to self-extract onto the target disk before running?</p>

<p>In this scenario, the 'compilation' requirement is relaxed: it doesn't matter if the code is actually compiled into machine code (it could simply be embedded as a text resource into the target executable), but the result must nevertheless be a <em>single</em> <code>exe</code> file [and nothing else] that can run standalone, specifically <em>without</em> needing to unpack/install anything onto the target disk before running.</p>

What the program is supposed to do is prompt a user for input (item name, quantity, weight, and price) and then add this item into a sorted (by increasing alphabetical order) database.</p>

<p>So my idea is to create a linked list. I've started by defining the following:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct item_t item;
struct item_t{
    char name;
    int weight;
    int price;
    int quantity;
    item *next;
};
</code></pre>

<p>So the idea that I'm going for is that every item has its details stored in this structure type, and that *next will point to the next structure in the linked list.</p>

<p>Next I came up with this:</p>

<pre><code>void add_new_node_at_end(char *user_input){
    new_node = (*item_t)malloc(sizeof(item_t))
    if (new_node == NULL){
        printf(""Memory failure"");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is this correct so far? </p>

<p>Now, I'm not too sure what to do about the pointer *next when I create a new node, nor do I know how to change the fields of the structure. Can I simply use <code>new_node.item = 'string'</code> or do I need to malloc the field names as well?</p>

<p>Sorry, this might be a silly question but I really need someone to point me in the right direction. </p>

<p>This has caused some trouble, however.</p>

<p>In Ukraine, Russian street names are widely used, even by official government bodies. Due to the recent change, Russian street names can no longer be retrieved - not in areas, where Russian is a regional, semi-official language and not even in Crimea, where Russian names are now the de-facto main official names after the peninsula's annexation by Russia. The following request will give back the Ukrainian name even when I specifically want the Russian one: <a href=""https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Lenina%20St,%20Sevastopol&amp;language=ru"" rel=""nofollow"">https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Lenina%20St,%20Sevastopol&amp;language=ru</a></p>

<p>Google Maps' Russian language layer still renders city names in Russian, but streets and most POIs will not get localized anymore. In Belarus, the situation is similar, although Russian is a fully official language there. Geocoding still works, but Google Maps is not displaying Russian names any longer on its Russian map layer.</p>

<p>Is there any work-around for this? </p>

<p>Following are configurations for that send port:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/tI8fq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I increased the timeout from 00:50:00 to 05:00:00 but no change in result. still getting same error.</p>

<p>I run <code>SP_WHO2</code> to get the list of connection those are running/queued. There were more than 100+ connection when the error raised. One of the query ""Select Into"" was in suspend mode and displayed as it was running from SSMS. but we have no such query and we never run any query from directly from SSMS.</p>

<p>Please suggest a way to resolve this.</p>

<p>When we send a login request, we want to get the CSRF token from the response header and use it insubsequent http calls. The http.get() request does that for us(it sets the login's response header into request header). After that we want to do a post request again based on the response we get from the http.get() request inside the login callback.</p>

<p>The problem here is that the code gets executed before the browser finishes, setting the CSRF token received from response into the request header.  In order to overcome this problem, I added a setTimeout function.  But I don't really like the approach of adding a hardcoded delay.</p>

to <code>www.mysite.com/John/Smith</code>. This works fine, but if I add a trailing <code>/</code> , a few images on the site disappear, wheras a few don't. (They're all in the same location). However, the search results are fine.</p>

<p>This function is called from an external library that I don't have access to change.  When it's called, the console is logging ""this"" as the window object instead of the actual instanced object.  Upon searching stackoverflow I found this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>this is set according to how the method is called, and not according to how the method is written. So for obj.method(), this will be set to obj inside of method(). For obj.method.call(x), this inside of method() will be set to x. It is determined by how it's called. What that also means is that if you pass it as a callback to e.g. onclick, this will be set to the global window object rather than what you expect.</p>

<p>In normal case there is a real simple piece of code to deserialize QByteArray into a QVariantMap</p>

<pre><code>    // Init Last Buffer
    QByteArray lastBuffer;

Sometimes I receive all data into one QByteArray, sometimes separately into different size packages, definitely not the way the packages were actually written/sent at the other side.</p>

<p>My question is: any of you had the same issue? is there already a solution? can you recommend a good solution for this?</p>

<p>Of course I can go and dig all relevant Qt source, but my point is in my project to have an easy but sophisticated enough solution reusing already existing Qt components with only a reasonable amount of effort put into customization, development and changes. Innovation ; )</p>

<li>Which iOS thermal receipt printers should we support (which are the most
popular and/or the best, which do you support)?</li>
<li>Which print protocol(s)/languages can we best support in order to maximise the
number of supported Bluetooth/network POS receipt printers?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>

LANGUAGE SQL;
</code></pre>

<p>This was used on INSERT and UPDATE to enter or edit a value in a created and modified field in the database record. However, we found when adding or updating records consecutively it was returning the same value. </p>

<p>On inspecting the function in pgAdmin III we noted that on running the SQL to build the function the key word IMMUTABLE had been injected after the LANGUAGE SQL statement. The <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-createfunction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> states that the default is VOLATILE (If none of these appear, VOLATILE is the default assumption) so I am not sure why IMMUTABLE was injected, however, changing this to STABLE has solved the issue of repeated values. </p>

<p>NOTE: <em>As stated in the accepted answer, IMMUTABLE is never added to a function by pgAdmin or Postgres and must have been added during development.</em> </p>

<p>I am guessing what was happening was that this function was being evaluated and the result was being cached for optimization, as it was marked IMMUTABLE indicating to the Postgres engine that the return value should not change given the same (empty) parameter list. However, when not used within a trigger, when used directly in the INSERT statement, the function would return a distinct value FIVE times before then returning the same value from then on. Is this due to some optimisation algorithm that says something like ""If an IMMUTABLE function is used more that 5 times in a session, cache the result for future calls""? </p>

<p>Any clarification on how these keywords should be used in Postgres functions would be appreciated. Is STABLE the correct option for us given that we use this function in triggers, or is there something more to consider, for example the docs say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(It is inappropriate for AFTER triggers that wish to query rows
  modified by the current command.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I am not altogether clear on why.</p>

I am currently at the point where I can open up any text file from the command line (an unlimited amount) and display them. I'd like to expand on this and have users enter phrases that format the displayed text. I have previously posted a similar question and I've gotten some great answers, but I cannot use getopt(). How else would it be possible to scan the command line for a ""-w"" and a number, so ""-w5"" and a ""-s"" with no number. Those are the only two things I'd like to be able to detect. I don't mind if statements, I was hoping for the shortest program in my friends, but at this point, I'd just like to get it done. Any ideas? Multiple if-statements was my friend's idea, I personally think this is unneeded, but if that's what I have to do... If anyone else has any ideas, that would be really useful. I just want my program to detect those two characters from the command line. I'm fairly new to C (I've only made a few programs), but I'm edger to learn and I have tried googling and trying this on my own, but being new to C, trying to find what I need through all the other text and jargon is difficult. </p>

<p>Anything will be useful, thanks. </p>

I'm trying to find the best way/datatype to store a month and year together without the day. I don't know whether I should just store it as a DATE and use php someway to just store the day as the 1st or use a different datatype that I'm not currently familiar with. Ideally, I do not want to store a day, because the day will not always be the same and would require changing php source code if the day changed in the future.</p>

<p>Just for more background info, I'm storing a STUDENT's INTENT_TO_GRAD. The client seems to only want this information as a reference or a visual for a report as opposed to using it for data manipulation.

But because I dont want to have 2 buttons, one for the ASC and one for the DESC, I thought of using preparedStatement and an showInputDialog in which the user will select if he wants to have an ASC or a DESC ordering and execute the order. Also, I remembered that some programs I've seen used a feature in which the first time you clicked the button it sorted DESC and if you pressed it again would order by ASC(havent managed to find in on the WEB).About my first thought, I tried to do it but I could get past this one </p>

Basically, what I want to do is to have two different targets - let's call them <code>RunUnitTests</code> and <code>RunIntegrationTests</code> - that generate an item group called <code>TestAssemblies</code> and then call <code>RunTests</code>, which uses <code>TestAssemblies</code> to determine which assemblies to run tests from. </p>

<p>The two different targets for unit and integration tests both depend on the build target and get an item group with all compiled assemblies from there, but since the <code>RunTests</code> target will be called from different places, it can't really depend on either of them. Thus, I need to pass the item group to the common testrunner target somehow. However, this seems to be impossible, because changes to an item group within a target seems to be scoped to only work within that target.</p>

<p>I've seen <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1088950/itemgroup-item-scope-alternatively-why-does-msbuild-hate-me"">these</a> <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3265632/why-doesnt-msbuild-itemgroup-conditional-work-in-a-global-scope"">posts</a>, but they only seem to confirm my fears, and suggest <code>DependsOnTarget</code> as a workaround - which won't work for me, since I need to get the items from different places on different runs.</p>

<p>This is what I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Target Name=""RunAllTests"" DependsOnTarget=""BuildProject""&gt;
    &lt;!-- In here, items created in BuildProject are available. --&gt;
    &lt;CallTarget Targets=""RunUnitTests;RunIntegrationTests""&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;

&lt;Target Name=""RunUnitTests"" DependsOnTarget=""BuildProject""&gt;
    &lt;!-- In here, items created in BuildProject are available. --&gt;
    &lt;!-- One of those is @(UnitTestAssemblies) --&gt;

    &lt;CreateItem Include=""@(UnitTestAssemblies)""&gt;
        &lt;Output TaskParameter=""Include"" ItemName=""TestAssemblies"" /&gt;
    &lt;/CreateItem&gt;

    &lt;CallTarget Targets=""RunTests"" /&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;

&lt;!-- Then there's a similar target named RunIntegrationTests, which does the
     same as RunUnitTests except it includes @(IntegrationTestAssemblies) --&gt;

&lt;Target Name=""RunTests""&gt;
    &lt;!-- Here, I'd like to access @(TestAssemblies) and pass them to the NUnit
         task, but they have fallen out of scope. --&gt;

I am trying to build a small android application which is basically shows the meaning of words. And to do so I intend to keep everything offline (no dependence of internet connectivity). Now, as far as I can think of, there are 2 ways of achieving that:
 1. Using String array, which I believe will be a tedious task and a memory hog.
 2. By providing a pre-populated database, using which I can easily establish relations between words and their meanings and do more (searching, sorting, etc).</p>

<p>Now, the problem I am facing is supplying a pre-populated database (or words and meanings) with the app itself. And for doing that I came across SQLite Asset Helper which does the job.</p>

<p>I have read a number of articles related to SQlite Asset Helper but not many which confirm its implementation on latest iterations of Android. Also, is the only possible solution to deliver a pre-populated database to the user (without needing to go online)? Is it acceptable method?

<p>Just see the stock sample in the docs: <a href=""http://docs.jboss.org/hornetq/2.2.2.Final/user-manual/en/html/message-grouping.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.jboss.org/hornetq/2.2.2.Final/user-manual/en/html/message-grouping.html</a></p>

<p>But in HornetQ (or jms at all), each group is pinned to one specific worker. This means if group A and group B are pinned to Worker X and there are 10 Messages for group A and 10 messages for group B in the queue, the group B messages have to wait until the group A messages are handled. (Although there are enough free workers, that can handle the group B messages right now)</p>

<p>Is there a way, to tell jms, not to pin each group to one specific worker, but only to ensure the serial processomg within each group.</p>

<p>The calling client is a user waiting to consume the resource who does not want to wait indefinitely. Therefore the api is polled up to a maximum number of attempts to get a 'complete' resource. Should the api return a status indicating the resource is complete, the resource is then returned up the stack for consumption. If the api does not return a status indicating the resource is complete within the maximum number of attempts then the client should stop polling and just return some kind of failure status.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this at the moment I am using <code>Thread.Sleep(500)</code> to block the thread that is waiting for the result. Its causing me nightmares thinking how inefficient this is, so I am looking to improve the technique.</p>

<pre><code>Class Row {
    Integer seq;
    Calendar start;
    Calendar end; // end will always be &gt; start
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I have a list of Row. I want to use binary search to be able to search for specific objects. Sometimes I want to find an object with a specific seq and sometimes I want to find an object who's date range contains a date.</p>

<p>The list will not contain any number of objects that have overlapping date ranges. So there will always only be one object returned from a search of any date.</p>

<p>I know that I must sort the vector before doing a search so here are my two Comparator classes:</p>

<pre><code>SeqComparator implements Comparator&lt;Row&gt;
{
    Compare(Row a, Row b)
    {
         return a.seq.compareTo(b.seq);
    }
}


DateComparator implements Comparator&lt;Row&gt;
{
    Compare(Row a, Row b)
    {
         return a.start.compareTo(b.start);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I see there are two methods for binary searches </p>

<pre><code>binarySearch(List&lt;? extends Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;&gt; list, T key)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>binarySearch(List&lt;? extends T&gt; list, T key, Comparator&lt;? super T&gt; c)
</code></pre>

<p>Here is what I want to be able to do.</p>

<pre><code>sort(list, new SeqComparator());
binarySearch(list&lt;Row&gt;, 4) 
// return the Row's index with seq of 4.

sort(list, new DateComparator());
Calendar today = Calendar.getInstance()
binarySearch(list&lt;Row&gt;, today) 
// return the Row's index where Row.start &lt;= today &lt;= Row.end
</code></pre>

<p>Please also note that I do not want to use Row as a Key in any case. I just want to be able to use an Integer as a Key in one case and a Calendar as a Key in the other case. So in my mind I can't use the first binary search because I am not using <code>natural sorting</code> which the api says I have to for that method and I can't use the second search because I want to search a list that is not extended from the class of the Key.</p>

<p>I know there should be a way I can do this, if someone would be so kind as to help me.</p>

<p>I figured I'd try using <a href=""https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug"" rel=""nofollow"">byebug</a> to figure out why the object is <code>nil</code> since it's never supposed to be <code>nil</code>. I placed <code>byebug</code> just above the erroneous line:</p>

<pre><code>def debug(&amp;block)
  if @logger.nil?
    byebug
  end

  @logger.debug(@logger_name, &amp;block)
end
</code></pre>

<p>And ran the tests. I was dropped to the byebug debugging interface and could confirm that the object was indeed <code>nil</code>. The problem is that I can't climb up the stack:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>(byebug) up

I am using <code>view_static</code> to generate the html file. The <a href=""http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggvis/functions/print.ggvis"" rel=""nofollow"">docs</a> say I can set the <code>dest</code> parameter to specify the target directory for the html file and dependencies. However, no matter what I put there, I end up with the files in my tmp directory. </p>

<p>For example, if I do</p>

<pre><code>library(ggvis)
test_plot &lt;- mtcars %&gt;% ggvis(~wt, ~mpg) %&gt;% layer_points()
view_static(test_plot, dest = tempfile(pattern = 'ggvis_test'))
</code></pre>

<p>I would expect my file to be something like <code>my/path/tmp/RtmpZw3qDp/ggvis_test7b3166824329/index.html</code>. Instead, it is <code>my/path/tmp/RtmpZw3qDp/viewhtml7b3166824329/index.html</code>, so did not adopt the pattern I specified.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like to   say <code>view_static(test_plot, dest = tempfile(pattern = '~/target_dir'))</code> and find the output directory <code>target_dir</code> in my home directory.</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong when calling <code>view_static</code>, or is there another way of exporting the html or embedding it somewhere? </p>

<p>EDIT - THERE IS A WORKAROUND</p>

<p>I have submitted an <a href=""https://github.com/rstudio/ggvis/issues/350"" rel=""nofollow"">issue</a> on the github development site for ggvis - Winston Chang confirmed that the <code>dest</code> parameter is now deprecated. However as a workaround it was suggested one use <code>view_static</code> and <code>html_print</code> eg.</p>

<pre><code>outfile &lt;- mtcars %&gt;% ggvis(~wt, ~mpg) %&gt;% view_static() %&gt;% htmltools::html_print()
outfile
# [1] ""/tmp/Rtmps5hgoi/viewhtml266b14fd08f8/index.html""
</code></pre>

<p>to get the location of the output file and then copy it to the target directory from there. Works fine.</p>

<p>The problem is both are being drawn at the same time. One should follow after the other. Using promsises is it possible to delay the second function while the first function is getting executed and later execute second function?

<pre><code>Part Ia - Using large dma-coherent buffers
------------------------------------------

void *
dma_alloc_coherent(struct device *dev, size_t size,
                 dma_addr_t *dma_handle, gfp_t flag)

Consistent memory is memory for which a write by either the device or
the processor can immediately be read by the processor or device
without having to worry about caching effects.  (You may however need
to make sure to flush the processor's write buffers before telling
devices to read that memory.)
</code></pre>

<p>Q1. Is it safe to assume that the area allocated is cacheable ? As the last line state that flushing is required</p>

<p>Q1a. Does this API allocate memory from lower 16MB which is considered DMA safe.</p>

<pre><code>dma_addr_t
dma_map_single(struct device *dev, void *cpu_addr, size_t size,
              enum dma_data_direction direction)

Maps a piece of processor virtual memory so it can be accessed by the
device and returns the physical handle of the memory.

The direction for both api's may be converted freely by casting.
However the dma_ API uses a strongly typed enumerator for its
direction:

DMA_NONE        no direction (used for debugging)
DMA_TO_DEVICE       data is going from the memory to the device
DMA_FROM_DEVICE     data is coming from the device to the memory
DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL   direction isn't known
</code></pre>

<p>Q2. Does the DMA_XXX options direct change of Page Attributes for the VA=>PA mapping. Say DMA_TO_DEVICE would mark the area as non-cacheable ?</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>Here I have my 'unclean' vector (including NAs) with the values of the columns            </p>

<pre><code>result[i] &lt;- c(cols)
}
return(result)
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here comes my problem: I initiated return as numeric above and whenever I try to paste the data from <code>cols</code>with either <code>result[i]</code>or <code>result[[i]]</code> i get the following errors respectively: </p>

<pre><code>for result[i]
number of items to replace is not a multiple of replacement length

for result[[i]]
more elements supplied than there are to replace
</code></pre>

<p>Now I realize this has to do with my <code>cols</code> being larger than my <code>result</code>: The question now is: how can I set this up so that the cols get added up to my result vector?</p>

    return this.transitionTo('posts');

<pre><code>App.Router.map(function() {

<p>The first solution does not seem reasonable because it always sends visitors to <code>/posts</code> instead of having an actual base path of <code>/</code>. The second solution does not seem reasonable because it <em>only</em> allows posts to be viewed from <code>/</code> and not <code>/posts</code>. The second solution inherently creates strange nested URLs like <code>/new</code> for a new post instead of <code>/posts/new</code>.</p>

<p>What is the most idiomatic way to configure <code>/</code> to load another route instead of redirecting, while still making the target resource available from its normal URL? In other words, I would like the <code>/</code> path to access posts, and still have posts available via <code>/posts</code>.</p>

<p>I'm asking the front end to send the <code>version</code> field back to the server when posting data.  On the server end, I am retrieving the entity from the DB using the PK, updating the version (along with other fields) with the posted value, and then having the entitymanager persist the entity.  I was hoping that it would automatically throw a StaleObject exception if the version has changed in the meantime, but it does nothing.</p>

<p>After further reading, it appears that I am not allowed to modify the version field programatically.<br>
According to the JPA spec, the application is not allowed to modify the version field:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>JPA 2.0 Final Spec, Section 3.4.2:</strong></p>
  
  <p>An entity may access the state of its version field or property or
  export a method for use by the application to access the version, but
  must not modify the version value. With the exception noted in section
  4.10, only the persistence provider is permitted to set or update the value of the version attribute in the object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is my only choice at this point to manually check the posted data's version against the DB's version every time myself?  Is there not a way to have the JPA provider do this for me?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>S -> a | b</p>

<p>The set of strings that may be generated by the grammar is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>{a, b}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, a grammar <em>generates</em> a set of strings.</p>

<p>A parser for a grammar takes an input string and determines if the string could be generated by the grammar.</p>

<p>Thus, a parser is a <em>recognizer</em> for a grammar.</p>

<p>At least, that is one use of a parser.</p>

<p>But oftentimes a parser is used for other things. For example, a parser for a grammar may take an input string and create a tree structure which contains the input data and conforms to the grammar.</p>

<p>In that case the parser is not a recognizer, it is a data structure builder.</p>

<p>I conclude that there are different types of parsers.</p>

<p>Am I thinking logically? Are there indeed different types of parsers?</p>

<p>Has someone created a list of the different types of things that parsers have been created for?</p>

"8806692","1","","","2012-01-10 16:26:39","","2","296","<p>I'm working on a project which will entail multiple devices, each with an embedded (ARM) processor, communicating.  One development approach which I have found useful in the past with projects that only entailed a single embedded processor was develop the code using Visual Studio, divided into three portions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Main application code (in unmanaged C/C++ [see note])
<li>I/O-simulating code (C/C++) that runs under Visual Studio
<li>Embedded I/O code (C), which Visual Studio is instructed not to build, runs on the target system.  Previously this code was for the PIC; for most future projects I'm migrating to the ARM.
</ol>

<p>Feeding the embedded compiler/linker the code from parts 1 and 3 yields a hex file that can run on the target system.  Running parts 1 and 2 together yields code which can run on the PC, with the benefit of better debugging tools and more precise control over I/O behavior (e.g. I can make the simulation code introduce certain types of random hiccups more easily than I can induce controlled hiccups on real hardware).</p>

<p>Target code is written in C, but the simulation environment uses C++ so as to simulate I/O registers.  For example, I have a PortArray data structure; the header file for the embedded compiler includes a line like <code>unsigned char LATA @ 0xF89;</code> and my header file for simulation includes <code>#define LATA _IOBIT(f89,1)</code> which in turn invokes a macro that accesses a suitable property of an I/O object, so a statement like <code>LATA |= 4;</code> will read the simulated latch, ""or"" the read value with 4, and write the new value.  To make this work, the target code has to compile under C++ as well as under C, but this mostly isn't a problem.  The biggest annoyance is probably with <code>enum</code> types (which behave as integers in C, but have to be coaxed to do so in C++).</p>

<p>Previously, I've used two approaches to making the simulation interactive:</p>

<ol><li>Compile and link a DLL with target-application and simulation code, and have VB code in the same project which interacts with it.
<li>Compile the target-application code and some simulation code to an EXE with instance of Visual Studio, and use a second instance of Visual Studio for the simulation-UI.  Have the two programs communicate via TCP, so nearly all ""real"" I/O logic is in the simulation program.  For example, the aforementioned `LATA |= 4;` would send a ""read port 0xF89"" command to the TCP port, get the response, process the received value, and send a ""write port 0xF89"" command with the result.</ol>

<p>I've found the latter approach to run a tiny bit slower than the former in some cases, but it seems much more convenient for debugging, since I can suspend execution of the unmanaged simulation code while the simulation UI remains responsive.  Indeed, for simulating a single target device at a time, I think the latter approach works extremely well.  My question is how I should best go about simulating a plurality of target devices (e.g. 16 of them).</p>

<p>The difficulty I have is figuring out how to make each simulated instance get its own set of global variables.  If I were to compile to an EXE and run one instance of the EXE for each simulated target device, that would work, but I don't know any practical way to maintain debugger support while doing that.  Another approach would be to arrange the target code so that everything would compile as one module joined together via <code>#include</code>.  For simulation purposes, everything could then be wrapped into a single C++ class, with global variables turning into class-instance variables.  That would be a bit more object-oriented, but I really don't like the idea of forcing all the application code to live in one compiled and linked module.</p>

<p>What would perhaps be ideal would be if the code could load multiple instances of the DLL, each with its own set of global variables.  I have no idea how to do that, however, nor do I know how to make things interact with the debugger.  I don't think it's really necessary that all simulated target devices actually execute code simultaneously; it would be perfectly acceptable for simulation instances to use cooperative multitasking.  If there were some way of finding out what range of memory holds the global variables, it might be possible to have the 'task-switch' method swap out all of the global variables used by the previously-running instance and swap in the contents applicable to the instance being switched in.  Although I'd know how to do that in an embedded context, though, I'd have no idea how to do that on the PC.
<p>
<b>Edit</b><p></p>

<p>My questions would be:</p>

<ol><li>Is there any nicer way to allow simulation logic to be paused and examined in VS2010 debugger, while keeping a responsive UI for the simulator front-end, than running the simulator front end and the simulator logic in separate instances of VS2010, if the simulation logic must be written in C and the simulation front end in managed code?  For example, is there a way to tell the debugger that when a breakpoint is hit, some or all other threads should be allowed to keep running while the thread that had hit the breakpoint sits paused?
<li>If the bulk of the simulation logic must be source-code compatible with an embedded system written in C (so that the same source files can be compiled and run for simulation purposes under VS2010, and then compiled by the embedded-systems compiler for use in real hardware), is there any way to have the VS2010 debugger interact with multiple simulated instances of the embedded device?  Assume performance is not likely to be an issue, but the number of instances will be large enough that creating a separate project for each instance would be likely be annoying in the absence of any way to automate the process.  I can think of three somewhat-workable approaches, but don't know how to make any of them work really nicely.  There's also an approach which would be better if it's possible, but I don't know how to make it work.
<ol><li>Wrap all the simulation code within a single C++ class, such that what would be global variables in the target system become class members.  I'm leaning toward this approach, but it would seem to require everything to be compiled as a single module, which would annoyingly affect the design of the target system code.  Is there any nice way to have code access class instance members as though they were globals, without requiring all functions using such instances to be members of the same module?
<li>Compile a separate DLL for each simulated instance (so that e.g. if I want to run up to 16 instances, I would include 16 DLL's in the project, all sharing the same source files).  This could work, but every change to the project configuration would have to be repeated 16 times.  Really ugly.
<li>Compile the simulation logic to an EXE, and run an appropriate number of instances of that EXE.  This could work, but I don't know of any convenient way to do things like set a breakpoint common to all instances.  Is it possible to have multiple running instances of an EXE attached to a single debugger instance?
<li>Load multiple instances of a DLL in such a way that each instance gets its own global variables, while still being accessible in the debugger.  This would be nicest if it were possible, but I don't know any way to do so.  Is it possible?  How?  I've never used AppDomains, but my intuition would suggest that might be useful here.
</ol>
<li>If I use one VS2010 instance for the front-end, and another for the simulation logic, is there any way to arrange things so that starting code in one will automatically launch the code in the other?
</ol>

<p>I'm not particularly committed to any single simulation approach; while it might be nice to know if there's some way of slightly improving the above, I'd also like to know of any other alternative approaches that could work even better.</p>

.OK the problem is user can enter on of that fields or even both.</p>

<p>I searched in the internet and found ""Linq.Dynamic"" library in ScottGu weblog.but in that library if we want to use SqlParameter in exported command we should use <strong>@0</strong> and <strong>param</strong> for that.problem is I don't know how many fields user entered.</p>

<p>I want use one query for that and no external tool like ""Linq Kit PredicateBuilder"".</p>

<p>If I create my query string Manually(and execute using ExecuteCommand) then I will abdicate SqlParameter and risk of Sql Injenction growing up.
How Can do that?

build using Spring MVC and security.</p>

<p>There is this feature where in user can download his daily tasks as csv file.
Implementation for this is simple, user clicks the button , client sends http get request and server responds
and sends the content and file gets downloaded successfully.
This works perfectly fine on all the desktop browsers. However when using chrome on android I have observed that server gets the same request twice.</p>

<p>First when user clicks the button chrome sends the request. 
When the server responds the download manager can be seen on android and the request is fired again.</p>

<p>Have a few question as to why am i seeing such a behavior ?</p>

<p>1) From what I understand the control goes to download manager and hence it makes a new request so that it could have more features like pause and resume and browser need not be blocked during the entire process ?</p>

<p>2) What happens to the data which was sent as part of the response to the first request ?</p>

<p>3) When we setup https on the application server the download
status in download manager goes into queued status. Thinking over it I realised
that it could be an issue because the certificate was self signed one ?
On importing the certificate into android's trust store every thing works fine.</p>

<p>Could any one kindly shed more light on the following questions.</p>

<p>Is this expected behavior? What exactly causes a thread to see a control's InvokeRequired as true/false?<br>

Then MinGW(<em>g++</em> compiler) is trying somehow link together cuda object file and c++ object file (main.o) with all libs into the executable file. g++ however doesnt know about VS runtime libs and is throwing these errors. So i guess i need somehow pass VS libs to g++.
How can i fix this?</p>

<p>Then later, I have a service that periodically checks the database for reminder times.  If the reminder time matches the server time, the system sends an email to the user.</p>

<p>I just now realized that this may not work because of time zone differences.</p>

<p>My question, what is the best way to handle time differences in the server and the client, so that the reminder is accurate?</p>

<p>For example.....  our server is set for central time at say 6:00pm...... The user who is on the east coast wants a reminder at 7:00pm... this means my server would need to send the reminder at 6:00pm server time.</p>

<p>My problem: </p>

<ul>
<li>In Android you can attach a android.widget.PopupMenu to a android.view.View : the menu is shown next to the view.</li>
<li>In osmdroid a marker is inherited from org.osmdroid.views.overlay.Overlay. Unfortunately Overlay is not inherited from View so i cannot attach a popup to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently i am attaching the menu to an image that is in the lower right corner but may be far away from the current marker.</p>

<p>This is my current code (from <a href=""https://github.com/k3b/AndroFotoFinder/blob/FDroid/app/src/main/java/de/k3b/android/androFotoFinder/locationmap/LocationMapFragment.java"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/k3b/AndroFotoFinder/blob/FDroid/app/src/main/java/de/k3b/android/androFotoFinder/locationmap/LocationMapFragment.java</a> )</p>

<pre><code>public class LocationMapFragment extends DialogFragment {
    ...
    protected   boolean showContextMenu(final View parent, final int markerId,
                                        final IGeoPoint geoPosition, final Object markerData) {
        MenuInflater inflater = getActivity().getMenuInflater();

        // currently the contextmenu is attached to some image ""this.mImage"" 
        // which does not correspont to ""geoPosition""

        // where i can attach the menu to?
        PopupMenu menu = new PopupMenu(getActivity(), this.mImage);

        inflater.inflate(R.menu.menu_map_context, menu.getMenu());

        menu.setOnMenuItemClickListener(new PopupMenu.OnMenuItemClickListener() {
            @Override
            public boolean onMenuItemClick(MenuItem item) {

<pre><code>typedef struct _MyStruct {
  // ... handful of non-trivial fields ...
} MyStruct;
</code></pre>

<p>I expect (read, intend) for lots of parts of the program to return one of these structs, but many of them should be able to return a ""null"" struct, which is a singleton/global.  The exact use case is for the implementing function to say ""I can't find what you asked me to return"".</p>

<p>I assumed this would be a simple case of defining a variable in a header file, and initializing it in the .c file.</p>

<pre><code>// MyStruct.h

// ... Snip ...

MyStruct NotFoundStruct;
</code></pre>

<p>-</p>

<pre><code>// MyStruct.c

NotFoundStruct.x = 0;
NotFoundStruct.y = 0;
// etc etc
</code></pre>

<p>But the compiler complains that the initialization is not constant.</p>

<p>Since I don't care about what this global actually references in memory, I only care that everything uses the same global, I tried just removing the initialization and simply leaving the definition in the header.</p>

<p>But when I do this:</p>

<pre><code>MyStruct thing = give_me_a_struct(some_input);
if (thing == NotFoundStruct) {
  // ... do something special
}
</code></pre>

<p>Th compiler complains that the operands to the binary operator ""=="" (or ""!="") are invalid.</p>

<p>How does one define such as globally re-usable (always the same memory address) struct?</p>

<p>My questions is: what is the best way to detect conflicts with this ID?

I found lexer states are the best solution and was able to do a POC using curly braces to mark the start and end. However, the subqueries will be delimited by parenthesis, not curlys, and the parenthesis can occur at other places as well, so I can't being the state with every open-paren. This information is readily available with the parser, so I was hoping to call begin and end at appropriate locations in the parser rules. This however didn't work because lexer seem to tokenize the stream all at once, and so the tokens get generated in the INITIAL state. Is there a workaround for this problem? Here is an outline of what I tried to do:</p>

<pre><code>def p_value_subquery(p):
    """"""
     value : start_sub end_sub
    """"""
    p[0] = ""( "" + p[1] + "" )""

def p_start_sub(p):
    """"""
    start_sub : OPAR
    """"""
    start_subquery(p.lexer)
    p[0] = p[1]

def p_end_sub(p):
    """"""
    end_sub : CPAR
    """"""
    subquery = end_subquery(p.lexer)
    p[0] = subquery
</code></pre>

<p>The start_subquery() and end_subquery() are defined like this:</p>

<pre><code>def start_subquery(lexer):
    lexer.code_start = lexer.lexpos        # Record the starting position
    lexer.level = 1
    lexer.begin('subquery') 

def end_subquery(lexer):
    value = lexer.lexdata[lexer.code_start:lexer.lexpos-1]
    lexer.lineno += value.count('\n')
    lexer.begin('INITIAL')
    return value
</code></pre>

<p>The lexer tokens are simply there to detect the close-paren:</p>

<pre><code>@lex.TOKEN(r""\("")
def t_subquery_SUBQST(t):
    lexer.level += 1

@lex.TOKEN(r""\)"")
def t_subquery_SUBQEN(t):
    lexer.level -= 1

@lex.TOKEN(r""."")
def t_subquery_anychar(t):
    pass

<p>Below is an example of the SOAP message which works on Asynch Endpoint B but which does not work on Synch Endpoint A  .. note that I've obtained the Asynch message by executing a Junit test and intercepted the generate message on ActiveMQ queue:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/""&gt;

<p>Here is the SOAP Request which works on Synchronous endpoint but not on the Asynch one .. this request was obtained from creating a request from the WSDL :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" xmlns:ser=""http://service.ws.example/"" xmlns:par=""http://party.beans.commons.example""&gt;

        &lt;par:person&gt;

           &lt;par:budgetPlanNumber&gt;131484&lt;/par:budgetPlanNumber&gt;

           &lt;par:employeeReduction&gt;J&lt;/par:employeeReduction&gt;

           &lt;par:employeeNumber&gt;&lt;/par:employeeNumber&gt;

<p>In both cases am using Aegis for data binding , I did try JAXB as well but with no futher success.</p>

<p>Given that its the same method with same method signature you would expect that the same request could be used in both asynch and synch but this does not seem to be the case .</p>

<p>Anybody has had similar issues or could possibly shed some light in regards to this ?</p>

<p>Note that am using the following dependencies:

<p>This works but is very cumbersome and I will have up to 20 check boxes.</p>

<p>How can I create a custom XAML Style that I can use for each image or something similar.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I have used the following style to handle the hover over:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Page.Resources&gt;
    &lt;Style TargetType=""Image"" x:Key=""checkBoxStyle""&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""Source"" Value=""/Images/checkcircle_off.png""/&gt;

            &lt;Trigger Property=""IsMouseOver"" Value=""True""&gt;
                &lt;Setter Property=""Source"" Value=""/Images/checkcircle_hover.png""/&gt;
            &lt;/Trigger&gt;
        &lt;/Style.Triggers&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;
&lt;/Page.Resources&gt;

    &lt;Image x:Name=""Image_Custom"" Style=""{StaticResource checkBoxStyle}"" Width=""16"" Height=""16"" HorizontalAlignment=""Left""  Margin=""30,107,0,0"" VerticalAlignment=""Top"" MouseEnter=""Image_Custom_MouseEnter"" MouseLeave=""Image_Custom_MouseLeave"" MouseUp=""Image_Custom_MouseUp"" MouseLeftButtonDown=""Image_Custom_MouseLeftButtonDown""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But I dont know how to handle the clicked event.  How can I do this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>I have did the following:</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;Style TargetType=""{x:Type CheckBox}"" x:Key=""myCheckBoxStyle""&gt;

        &lt;/Setter&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;

<p>The correct images appear when hovered, checked and unchecked.<br>
But I noticed that the Content has disappeared (""My Checkbox"") and also I only want the hover state to appear when its not checked, how can I do that?</p>

In this class, I use the <code>@PropertySource</code> annotation to load a properties file for various settings (e.g. database connection details).</p>

<p>Currently, I use Maven profiles with Ant tasks to create the correct properties file(s) for my runtime environment. That is, I get Maven to move a ""prod.properties"" or ""dev.properties"" to ""application.properties"" (which the class uses) at build time.

<pre><code>@PropertySource( value = ""classpath:/application-${spring.profiles.active}.properties"")

<p>I also want to set the profile without using any XML. So I would need to set the profile based on the presence of a system property. For example,</p>

<pre><code>String currentEnvironment = systemProperties.getProperty(""current.environment"");

  ((ConfigurableEnvironment)context.getEnvironment()).setActiveProfiles(""production"");
} else {

According to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/20473180/7979"">an answer</a> to a related question, this could be done in an override of the <code>createRootApplicationContext</code> method in my initializer class. But, that answer also relies on the configuration classes being loaded before setting the profile.</p>

<li>Make a series of service calls</li>
<li>Call the logout</li>

<p>To have a stateless wrapper it seems right pattern is to have each method in the bean perform all three steps above. e.g. (pseudocode)</p>

binding.upsert(….);
binding.upsert(….);
binding.logout();

To avoid having to actually draw pictures of the cards I used the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_cards_in_Unicode"" rel=""nofollow"">corresponding Unicode characters</a> (eg. U+1F0A1 🂡). While this works great on a modern Linux desktop (where <a href=""http://www.dejavu-fonts.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">DejaVu</a> Sans is used to display these characters), other operating systems (for example Windows or Android) seem to lack a font that can display the characters.</p>

<p>An easy solution would be to load DejaVu Sans via <code>@font-face</code>. To avoid having to download all of DejaVu Sans, I'd like to create a font that contains only the relevant code points. In principle <a href=""http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator"" rel=""nofollow"">Font Squirrel's Webfont Generator</a> allows that, but I cannot get it to work with characters from Unicode Plane 1 (where the playing card symbols are).</p>

<p>Is there some easy way to create <code>@font-face</code>-compatible fonts that contain U+1F0A0 to U+1F0DF?</p>

<p>You create a CMS of some sort, which asks you for an application name and a <strong>csv</strong> file for that application.
Then it automatically creates that app on the fly, creates the required <strong>model.py</strong> based on the csv columns, activates the admin page for it and allows only you to have the full permission to this new table via django admin, then it inserts the the app into the url.py and creates the view.py for it as well.</p>

<p>Then all you'd have to do is upload a csv, name your app and whola!, you have an admin page to play with.</p>

<p>To insert a ""no value"" (NULL) into a decimal column, I need to insert >None&lt;  not >''&lt; and not >'None'&lt;      </p>

<p>The implication is that when I build the dictionary of parameters from the comma-separated-value, I need to do a cleanup function that converst any empty string ('') into a a _builtin.None instead.  (unless I can figure out some way to make the CSV module automatically convert empty-strings ('') into a None.</p>

<p>My thoughs how the dht works are the following:
Lets say im joining a p2p network and i want to <strong>share</strong> some files. For these files, hashmap keys are generated and ""traveled"" through the network until the nodes who are responsible for these generated keys are accessed. Then each of these nodes add in his list a record that says ""the guy with the x IP address has the file that is related with the specified key. </p>

<p>When i <strong>search</strong> for a file, the hashmap key is generated for this file and travels the network until the node responsible for this key is found. Then this node is communicates with me and send me the IP addresses for the nodes that hosts the real data</p>

<p>The function crashes in the line:</p>

<p>What I want to do:</p>

<p>Say I have a registered formula member and it's function</p>

<pre><code>var formula = {
    member:['MAX','MIN','AVG','SUM'],
    max:function(cell1,cell2){
        ...
        //return the max
    }
    //.... and other function not listed
}
</code></pre>

<p>and have an HTML element with data-formula attribute</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div data-formula=""MAX($A1,$A5)""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>if the variable placeholder $A1 acted as parameter of listed formula (MAX,MIN,SUM, and AVG) it should replaced by 1.1 (convert A to 1 and concatenate with dot), and if it outside the formula bracket, it should kept remain and will be replaced later (if you could help build jison file that make the MAX() accept string, that would be great :) )</p>

<p>my current code is look like below</p>

<pre><code>var $equation = '';
var $formula_regex  = new RegExp('['+formula.member.join('|')+']+\(([^]+)\)','g');
//should be [SUM|AVG|MAX|MIN]+\(([^]+)\)

//this.data[$key].formula contains the string formula
$equation  = this.data[$key].formula.replace($formula_regex,function($range){
$range = $range.replace(/\$\w+/g, function($key) {
    $key = $key.replace('$','');

        //utility.translaceCell will convert B23 to 2.23, C2 to 3.2 etc
    $key = utility.translateCell($key,'string');
    return $key;
});
    return($range);
});
</code></pre>

<p>above regex work as expected when it contain single formula like MAX($B1,$B3)</p>

<pre><code>MAX($B1,$B3) 
//translated to MAX(2.1,2.3)
</code></pre>

<p>but not work when contain more complex formula</p>

<pre><code>IF($B1 &gt; 3,SUM($B1,$B3),MIN($B1,$B3))
//translated to IF(2.1 &gt; 3,SUM(2.1,2.3),MIN(2.1,2.3))

The textView is not yet firstresponder; the text is initially for reading only.  In iOS4 the goToEndOfNote code positions the cursor at the end of the text AND scrolls to that position.  In 3.1.3 it doesn't scroll to the end until the screen is touched (which isn't required unless a change or addition is required), making the textView firstresponder.  I would like it to work in 3.1.3 as it does in 4.0.  Any ideas please.  Thanks.</p>

<p>The above code illustrates what I <em>want</em> to do. I want to set the out parameter, but only under a similar condition as the one depicted. In the false-case of <code>Test(...)</code> I'm totally uninterested in the value of <code>out t</code>. But the above is ofcourse not working code.
The problem above is that an <code>out</code> parameter <em>must</em> be initialized. But maybe initialization is sometimes expensive (depends on type of <code>T</code>) and I don't want to initialize a dummy class instance just to make the compiler stop complaining. So the question then becomes: How do you initialize an unknown type (and making sure it is initialized to null if it's a class)?? </p>

<p>Well in theory you should be able to write something like</p>

<pre><code>public static bool Test&lt;T&gt;(ref A a, out T t)
{
  //...
  else
  {
    if(typeof(T).IsValueType)
    {
      t = (T)0; //Can't cast from int to T error (Yeah, this is a little tricky...)
      //OR:
      t = new T(); //No-no, doesn't have the new()-restriction on T (But we know it's a value type... life sucks)
    }
    else
      t = null; //Error: Can't set to null! T could be valueType! (No it CAN'T... again life sucks)
    return false;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But alas it's not so simple. The first problem is when T is value-type, we should be able to create it but compiler wont let us. The second problem is similar: ""It could be a value-type!"" - no, I just made sure it wasn't. It <em>should</em> work but it doesn't. Very annoying.</p>

<p>Ok. So we start to go creative... after all, there is this nice class called Object, and it has a special relation to all things C#'ish.</p>

<pre><code>public static bool Test&lt;T&gt;(ref A a, out T t)
{
  //...
  else
  {
    if(typeof(T).IsValueType)
    {
      t = (T)(object)0; //Works ONLY if T is valuetype: int, otherwise you get a ""must be less than infinity""-error.
    }
    else
    {
      t = (T)(object)null; //Null ref exception in the cast...
    }
    return false;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This <em>compiles</em> atleast. But it's still rubbish. Runtime-error galore.
The problem with the value-type is that the object-type remembers what type it <em>really</em> is and when trying to cast to something else... strange things happen (infinity? Really??)
Well this damn well <em>should</em> be doable! So lets be <em>more</em> creative!</p>

<pre><code>public static bool Test&lt;T&gt;(ref A a, out T t)
{
  //...
  else
  {
    if(typeof(T).IsValueType)
    {
      //... still rubbish here
    }
    else
    {
      object o = null;
      t = (T)o; //Tricked you stupid compiler!
    }
    return false;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's right! It looks a stupid insignificant change... But this compiles - and for non-value-types this runs <em>and</em> gives exactly the result we want! If T is a ref-type it gets initilized to null.
Still the problem with value-types. Somewhat reluctantly creativity turns it attention to Reflection. After some random digging around on reflection-stuff, looking for something worth trying out (and no! you cant get the constructor for a value-type, it returns null) I stumbled across a small note on msdn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""To create an instance of a value type that has no instance
  constructors, use the CreateInstance method.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Enter <code>CreateInstance&lt;T&gt;()</code> - <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0hcyx2kd.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0hcyx2kd.aspx</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The CreateInstance generic method is used by compilers to implement
  the instantiation of types specified by type parameters.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we're getting somewhere! Sure it does say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""In general, there is no use for the CreateInstance in application
  code, because the type must be known at compile time. If the type is
  known at compile time, normal instantiation syntax can be used (new
  operator in C#, New in Visual Basic, gcnew in C++).""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But hey - we are not quite doing general stuff, we are in creative-mode, and the compiler is grumpy towards us. Totally justifies giving it a try.</p>

<pre><code>public static bool Test&lt;T&gt;(ref A a, out T t)
{
  //...
  else
  {
    if(typeof(T).IsValueType)
    {
      t = Activator.CreateInstance&lt;T&gt;(); //Probably not your everyday code...
    }
    else
    {
      object o = null;
      t = (T)o;
    }
    return false;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>AND BAM! That was it! It totally works <em>soo</em> good!
Below is some code thats been tested and run in both VS2010SP1 and MonoDevelop (with Unity3.4)</p>

<p>using System;</p>

<pre><code>namespace GenericUnrestrictedOutParam
{
    class Program
    {
        class TestClass
        {
            public int i;
        }

        struct TestStruct
        {
            int i;
            TestClass thing;
        };

        public static void NullWorkaround&lt;T&gt;(out T anything)
        {
            if (typeof(T).IsValueType)
            {
                anything = Activator.CreateInstance&lt;T&gt;();
            }
            else
            {
                object o = null;
                anything = (T)o;
            }
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int i;
            float f;
            string s;
            TestStruct ts;
            TestClass c;

            NullWorkaround&lt;int&gt;(out i);
            NullWorkaround&lt;float&gt;(out f);
            NullWorkaround&lt;string&gt;(out s);
            NullWorkaround&lt;TestStruct&gt;(out ts);
            NullWorkaround&lt;TestClass&gt;(out c);
        } //Breakpoint here for value-checking
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the glorious ""output"" (from locals-panel @ breakpoint):</p>

<pre><code>        args    {string[0]} string[]
        i   0   int
        f   0.0 float
        s   null    string
-       ts  {GenericUnrestrictedOutParam.Program.TestStruct}    GenericUnrestrictedOutParam.Program.TestStruct
          i 0   int
          thing null    GenericUnrestrictedOutParam.Program.TestClass
        c   null    GenericUnrestrictedOutParam.Program.TestClass
</code></pre>

<p>Even the struct with a value and a class-type in it is beautifully handled: value type is 0, class instance is nulled!
<strong>Mission accomplished!</strong></p>

<p>Good afternoon, and good night.</p>
