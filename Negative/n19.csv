<pre><code>      var s = window.screen;

           var height = q.height = s.height / 6;

<p>From what I can gather these two lines of code are responsible for printing the characters out to screen:</p>

<pre><code>           var letters = Array(256).join(1).split('');


               text = String.fromCharCode(3e4+Math.random()*33);

<p>However this is where I get stuck, it seems it is printing out from a random maths operation. I don't understand the process for changing this and telling it to instead print out the unicode range for the cyrillic script.</p>

<p>Any help would be great, hope I've been clear enough.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I've just been playing about with it and made some sort of progress. The cyrillic alphabet's unicode range runs from '0410' to '042F' - so I edited </p>

<pre><code>    text = String.fromCharCode(3e4+Math.random()*33);
</code></pre>

<p>And rewrote it as
         text = String.fromCharCode(0410, 0411, 0412, 0413, 0414);</p>

<p>This code works but it prints all 5 of the characters at once and ruins the matrix code in the process. What I need to do I think is to get it to print single characters from a defined range this though I feel is currently above my level of understanding.</p>

<p>Where the <code>DataTestWorker</code> class is in fact the threaded class, initialised in a <code>DataTest</code> class.

<p>Is there a way to somehow pass it some sort of ""shared"" pointer - in which not only this class - but other classes can access it. The only way around this I can think of is I could use signals and slots between the <code>DataTest</code> and the <code>DataTestWorker</code> class to manipulate the values in the <code>SystemController</code>, but this would be long and verbose.</p>

             break;
        case WM_PAINT:
             // paint/display counter variable onto window

             InvalidateRect(hwnd, NULL, TRUE); //force window to repaint itself
             break; 
        case WM_LBUTTONDOWN: //someone clicks the window
             MessageBox(hwnd, """", """", 0);
             MessageBeep(MB_OK); //play a sound after MessageBox returns

        //default ....
    }

</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, the program's main function is to run a timer and display the counter's value every second. However, if the user clicks on our window, the program displays a message box and then beeps after the box is closed. </p>

<p>Here's where it gets interesting: we can tell <code>MessageBox()</code> is a synchronous function because <code>MessageBeep()</code> doesn't execute until the message box is closed. However, the timer keeps running, and the window is repainted every second even while the message box is displayed. So while <code>MessageBox()</code> is apparently a blocking function call, other messages (<code>WM_TIMER</code>/<code>WM_PAINT</code>) can still be processed. That's fine, except if I substitute MessageBox for another blocking call like <code>Sleep()</code></p>

<pre><code>    case WM_LBUTTONDOWN:
         Sleep(10000); //wait 10 seconds
         MessageBeep(MB_OK);
         break;
</code></pre>

<p>This blocks my application entirely, and no message processing occurs for the 10 seconds (<code>WM_TIMER</code>/<code>WM_PAINT</code> aren't processed, the counter doesn't update, program 'freezes', etc). So why is it that <code>MessageBox()</code> allows message processing to continue while <code>Sleep()</code> doesn't? Given that my application is single-threaded, what is it that <code>MessageBox()</code> does to allow this functionality? Does the system 'replicate' my application thread, so that way it can finish the <code>WM_LBUTTONDOWN</code> code once <code>MessageBox()</code> is done, while still allowing the original thread to process other messages in the interim? (that was my uneducated guess)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>My goal is to setup the class to call real methods, <strong>except</strong> for those methods I explicitly mock.</p>

<p>Basically:</p>

<pre><code>@Before
public void setupStaticUtil() {
  PowerMockito.mockStatic(StaticUtilClass.class);

  when(StaticUtilClass.someStaticMethod(antString())).thenReturn(5); // mock out certain methods...

  // Now have all OTHER methods call the real implmentation???  How do I do this?
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I'm running into is that within <code>StaticUtilClass</code> the method <code>public static int someStaticMethod(String s)</code> unfortunately throws a <code>RuntimeException</code> if supplied with a <code>null</code> value.</p>

<p>So I can't simply go the obvious route of calling real methods as the default answer as below:</p>

<pre><code>@Before
public void setupStaticUtil() {
  PowerMockito.mockStatic(StaticUtilClass.class, CALLS_REAL_METHODS); // Default to calling real static methods

  // The below call to someStaticMethod() will throw a RuntimeException, as the arg is null!
  // Even though I don't actually want to call the method, I just want to setup a mock result
  when(StaticUtilClass.someStaticMethod(antString())).thenReturn(5); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>I need to set the default Answer to call real methods on all other static methods <strong>after</strong> I mock the results from the method I'm interested in mocking.</p>

<p>Is this possible?  </p>

<p>The loop seems to be looping over the columns, not the rows. How can I make it loop over the rows? Or is there a better way to combine the data to permit looping over them all in a single loop?</p>

<p>So then I tried looping over the same structure differently and that still didn't work...</p>

<pre><code>&gt; yesFiles = c(""yFile1"", ""yFile2"", ""yFile3"", ""yFile4"")
&gt; noFiles = c(""nFile1"", ""nFile2"", ""nFile3"", ""nFile4"")
&gt; allFiles = data.frame(result=c(rep(""yes"", times=length(yesFiles)), rep(""no"", times=length(noFiles))), name=c(yesFiles, noFiles))
&gt; allFiles
  result   name
1    yes yFile1
2    yes yFile2
3    yes yFile3
4    yes yFile4
5     no nFile1
6     no nFile2
7     no nFile3
8     no nFile4
&gt; 
&gt; allFiles[1,1]
[1] yes
Levels: no yes
&gt; allFiles[1,2]
[1] yFile1
Levels: nFile1 nFile2 nFile3 nFile4 yFile1 yFile2 yFile3 yFile4
&gt; # ...ah, great! These seem to be giving me what I need.
&gt; 
&gt; for (i in 1:nrow(allFiles)) {
+    result = allFiles[i,1]
+    file = allFiles[i,2]
+    cat(sep="""", ""File '"", file, ""' is a '"", result, ""' file.\n"")

File '5' is a '2' file.

<p><strong><em>The following is additional information</em></strong> about what I need to actually do inside the loop, <strong><em>requested by 'Colonel Beauvel'</em></strong> in a comment below his answer.....</p>

<p>First of all, a utility function I need for converting text timestamps on each row of the .csv files:</p>

<pre><code>#-----------------------------------------------
# Read a text timestamp of the form ""yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.xxx"",
# where xxx=milliseconds. Returns a numeric value of the seconds
# since Jan 1 1970, with millisecond precision (i.e. 3 decimal places).
#
readTimestamp = function (tstamp) {
  as.numeric(strptime(tstamp,format='%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.')) +
  as.numeric(substr(tstamp,20,23))
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the loop I'd like to be running (the code has not been debugged, so I'm sure there are problems with it):</p>

<pre><code>colnamesToKeep = union(""Seconds"", sensorNamesForThisModel)
dataset = list() # Eventually 'dataset' will hold all training data from all files
for (file in allFiles)
{
   cat(sep="""", ""Reading '"", file['result'], ""' file \"""", file['name'], ""\"".\n"")
   tmp = read.csv(file['name'], na.strings=c(""."", ""NA"", """", ""?""), strip.white=TRUE, encoding=""UTF-8"")
   attr(tmp, ""names"")[1] = ""Seconds""   # Rename column 1 to ""Seconds"" (it's not yet, but it will be)
   tmp = tmp[,-2:-4]      # Delete these columns; they're irrelevant to the KSVM model
   beginTime = readTimestamp(tmp[1,1])
   # Convert column 1 from text timestamps to numeric seconds (msec precision) starting at 0.000
   tmp[,1] = readTimestamp(tmp[,1]) - beginTime
   # Delete all columns for sensors that this model cares nothing about...
   colIndicesToDelete = -which(!(colnames(tmp) %in% colnamesToKeep))
   tmp = tmp[,colIndicesToDelete] # Delete all columns for sensors that this model cares nothing about
   dataset[[length(dataset)+1]] = list(result=file['result'], data=tmp) # Add this to the training dataset
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am open to any &amp; all suggestions, including and especially for ""you shouldn't be using <code>union()</code> to create your <code>colnamesToKeep</code> variable"". Thank you very much!</p>

<p>I tried to create the 7segement and pulse generator but I need help creating the 4to1 mux (i've only created 2to1 mux before) and the up/down counter.</p>

<p>this is the description on my lab paper.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>pulse gen: used to control the time in which counter will increment or
  decrement. it uses the input named DELAU to determine length of time
  in-between each pulse output. each clock tick is counted. when # of
  counted clock ticks equal the delay input, a pulse is generated.</p>
  
  <p>up/down counter: will increment or decrement an 8bit register each
  time pulse is received. when external switch from xilinx board is
  high(1) then counter will increment. switch is low(0) it will
  decrement the register. register count data is outputted to toplevel
  for LEDs and 7segement display.</p>
  
  <p>4to1 mux: provide delay input to pulse gen. four inputs to mux will be
  hard-coded in top-level to provide a delay length of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and
  2 seconds delay respectively. the 2bit select will come from 2
  switches on xilinx board. from board, user will be able to switch
  choose the delay time the counter will count up or down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so here is what i have so far. i really don't have much for the mux and updown counter. (could you also please check my pulsegen?)</p>

<p>4to1MUX</p>

<pre><code>`timescale 1ns / 1ps

    assign seg0 = 500000000;
    assign seg1 = 1000000000;
    assign seg2 = 1500000000;
    assign seg3 = 2000000000;
endmodule
</code></pre>

<p>UP/DOWN COUNTER</p>

<pre><code>`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module updownCounter(updown,pulse,count);
    input [7:0] updown,

     (i'm not sure what goes here)

    input [28:0] delay;
     output pulse;
     wire pulse;
     reg [28:0] count;

     always @(posedge clk, posedge rst)
        if (rst)
            count &lt;= 28'b0;

All works fine with the exception that the Java app starts off minimized and I want it to start with the window displayed. Here's the relevant code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>// Construct the command string to be used for the CreateProcess call,
//including a parameter string
sprintf(cmdStr, ""javaw -jar \""AppDir\\App.jar\"" %s"", parmStr);

// Create and initialized startup-info structure for use with CreateProcess call
STARTUPINFO startInfo;
ZeroMemory(&amp;startInfo, sizeof(startInfo));

startInfo.wShowWindow = SW_NORMAL;
startInfo.dwFlags = STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW;
startInfo.cb = sizeof(startInfo);
PROCESS_INFORMATION procInfo;
ZeroMemory(&amp;procInfo, sizeof(procInfo));

if (!CreateProcess(NULL, cmdStr, NULL, NULL, FALSE, 0, NULL, NULL, &amp;startInfo,  &amp;procInfo))
{
   MessageBox( dialogOwner, ""Create Process Error"", ""Application not instantiated"", MB_OK);
}
</code></pre>

<p>According to the MSDN literature, setting the <strong>wShowWindow</strong> flag to SW_NORMAL and <strong>dwFlags</strong> to STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW ought to do the trick but some of the comments I've read in this and other forums imply that sometimes those flags are ignored (e.g. for console apps) so I was wondering if that was the case here. For the record, I've had this problem before then it went away on its own and now it's back after I made some code changes. But I wasn't setting any flags in the startupinfo structure before, so I was hoping to achieve some consistency in behaviour by doing so. Any tips or pointers would be appreciated...</p>

<p>My solution for this is using a script filter. I didn't know how to implement this with MVEL, so I installed the <a href=""https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-lang-javascript"" rel=""nofollow"">javascript plugin</a>. Now my query looks like this:</p>

<p>A <a href=""https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/3094"" rel=""nofollow"">similar issue</a> was posted where it was suggested it's a problem with the JIT compiler. As a workaround it was suggested to disable it by using '-Dmvel2.disable.jit=true'. I've tried this, by putting it in ES_JAVA_OPTS in /etc/default/elasticsearch but it didn't seem to have any effect.</p>

<p>Does anybody have a clue what's going wrong and how to fix it, or have an alternative way of performing this query? </p>

<p>When I <strong>logout</strong> by using <strong>Spring Security</strong> utils everything goes fine, the <code>preDestroy()</code> method is called. </p>

In this question:</p>

<ol>
<li>Application version 7 (and DB version 7) is deployed in production</li>
<li>Work starts on app version 8</li>
<li>DB version 8 is developed and deployed in the acceptance test environment</li>
<li>Bug is identified in production</li>
<li>DB version 7.1 is developed and must be acceptance-tested</li>
</ol>

<p>When flyway:migrate will be invoked against the acceptance test environment, it will notice that v8 has already been executed and so that there is no need to execute v7.1.</p>

<p>On one side it makes sense since v7.1 might not be compatible with v8, and it is not up to Flyway to analyze this.  Fail-fast is entirely understandable.</p>

<p>On the other side, the only way to deploy v7.1 to the acceptance test environment is to clean the database and run flyway:migrate with target = v7.1, thereby discarding data that might have had its use.</p>

<p>Is there a feature I'm not aware of that handles this case or is clean + migrate.target=v7.1 the only option?</p>

<pre><code>1,I tried FOP and other xstl library, but it can't work with .doc well.
2,I can not use itext because the format of the .doc is complex and strict, it would kill me if I make a .pdf looking like the same as the .doc tempates with code.
3,I have worked with flying-saucer in the folowing steps:
      1).doc transformed to .html documents
      2)edit the .html documents with free-marker language to generte .flt templates
      3)fill table rows in .flt with dynamic data fetched from database generate middle xhtml stream
      4)generate .pdf file from xhtml stream with flying-saucer
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, my solution is really so awkward.It would not be a good solution to handle with 100+ templates. </p>

<p><strong>Here is my question:</strong>
(1)Is there a ""silver bullet"" can handle .doc(should be dynamiclly added table row datas) and rich-text(html/xhtml) to my .pdf file?</p>

<p>(2)If there is not(I really can not find one.).How should I work out it?And How should I deal with the .doc templates?</p>

<p>(3)@MihaiC give me a solution, but my boss does not buy it cause he want me to try an open-source solution.So, if use the oracle publisher,can I use it freely and with full function now and i futrue?</p>

<p>======================privious qustion edited on Dec 3' 2014============================</p>

<p>I have a pdf tampalte file that has <strong>a table only with a table-head</strong>. Now I need to <strong>add table rows contents</strong> accroding to data fetched from my database.
I have searched a lot in SO, but I can't find a solution to this problem.
Does anyone know if there is a java library can help me do this?</p>

<p>PS-></p>

<p>I <strong>dont't want to create a new table</strong> for the pdf file but add rows following the table head.</p>

<p>The reason why I can't create a pdf from scratch is that the format of the output pdf file is so strict that it is too complex to create it by code.So I need to just use the pdf template file to maintain it's format and layout</p>

public class Class1 {
    @Autowired
    private Class2 object2;
    ...
}

@Service
@Transactional
public class Class2{
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I need that the Class2 implements an interface so I've only changed the Class2 so it's now like:</p>

<pre><code>@Controller
public class Class1 {
    @Autowired
    private Class2 object2;
    ...
}

@Service
@Transactional
public class Class2 implements IServiceReference&lt;Class3, Long&gt;{
   ...
}

public interface IServiceReference&lt;T, PK extends Serializable&gt; {
    public T reference(PK id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>with this code I get a <code>org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No matching bean of type for Class2</code>.
It seems that <code>@Transitional</code> annotation is not compatible with the interface because if I remove the <code>@Transitional</code> annotation or the i<code>mplements IServiceReference&lt;Class3, Long&gt;</code> the problem disapears and the bean is injected (though I need to have both in this class). It also happens if I put the annotation <code>@Transitional</code> in the methods instead of in the Class.</p>

<p>I use Spring 3.0.2 if this helps.</p>

<p>Is not compatible the interface with the transactional method? 
May it be a Spring bug?</p>

<p>In this simple app, I have a scroll view with and in order for it to work, I have to set the view's bottom space to scrollview constraint to 0 as described <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/15516706/1077789"">here</a> and it works fine. I'm doing it through the IB.</p>

<p>Now I've come across a scenario where I have to do that part programatically. I've added the below code in the <code>viewDidLoad</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>NSLayoutConstraint *bottomSpaceConstraint = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:self.view
                                                                             attribute:NSLayoutAttributeBottom

[self.view addConstraint:bottomSpaceConstraint];

<p>But it doesn't seem to work. It outputs the following message in the console window adn i don't know what to make of it.</p>

<p><strong>Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.
    Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. Try this: (1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. (Note: If you're seeing NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that you don't understand, refer to the documentation for the UIView property translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints)

<p>Can someone please tell me how to do this? I've also attached a demo project <a href=""http://www52.zippyshare.com/v/15239751/file.html"">here</a> so that you can get a better idea on the issue.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>First off thanks for the responses. Using the ways mentioned in the answers I was able to get it working. However ina  slightly different scenario its not. Now I'm trying to load a view onto a viewcontroller programatically. </p>

<p>If I may explain further. There are 2 view controllers. First one being a <code>UITableViewController</code> and the second one a <code>UIViewController</code>. Inside that a <code>UIScrollView</code>. Also There are multiple <code>UIView</code>s and some of those views' height exceeds the normal height of the screen. </p>

<p>The <code>UITableViewController</code> displays a list of options. Based on the user's selection, a particular <code>UIView</code> out of the lot will be loaded into the <code>UIViewController</code> with the <code>UIScrollView</code>.</p>

<p>In this scenario, the above method doesn't work. The scrolling isn't happening. Do I have to do something different since I'm loading the view separately?</p>

<p>I've uploaded a demo project <a href=""http://www72.zippyshare.com/v/15876364/file.html"">here</a> so that you can see it in action. Please see the <code>Email.xib</code> and select <strong>Email</strong> from the table view list.</p>

<p>Sorry for dragging this along. I'm seriously stuck on this one. </p>

fooroute,alles,p0000
fooroute,alles
fooroute
</code></pre>

<p>Starting with:</p>

<pre><code>fooroute,([\+\sa-zA-Z]+),([p0-9]+),(\d+)
</code></pre>

<p>I ended up with following regex:</p>

<pre><code>fooroute(?:\,|$)([\+a-zA-Z]+|$)(?:\,|$)([p0-9]+|$)(?:\,|$)([0-9]+|$)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Links listed above work just fine.</strong></p>

<p>The problem is that <code>\+</code> in first parameter does not seem to be working fine. 
Trying to hit following route:</p>

<pre><code>fooroute,This+Is+Test,p0000,1
</code></pre>

<p>I end up with <code>Page not found</code> exception.</p>

<p>I built my pattern using <code>regexr.com</code>, and result of my work can be found <a href=""http://regexr.com/39rva"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>What I'm missing?</p>

But doins so I can't make the table scroll anymore (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3417808/uitableview-custom-gestures-make-it-scrolling-no-more"">see here</a>).</p>

<p>So now I'm trying to make tha tableview scroll programmatically and I am looking at <code>setContentOffset:animated:</code> and <code>scrollRectToVisible:animated:</code> with having success only with the first.<br>
Here is my code in a class that subclasses the UITableView:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{
    NSLog(@""BEGTB"");
    //previousXPan = 0.0;

    UITouch * touch = [touches anyObject];
    CGPoint tPoint = [touch locationInView:self]; 
    previousYPan = tPoint.y;

    [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event];
    //
    //[super touchesShouldBegin:touches withEvent:event inContentView:self];
    //[[self nextResponder] touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event];
}

- (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{
    UITouch * touch = [touches anyObject];
    CGPoint tPoint = [touch locationInView:self]; 


    NSLog(@""MOVTB"");
    NSLog(@""BOUNDZ %f, %f, %f, %f"", self.bounds.origin.x, self.bounds.origin.y, self.bounds.size.height, self.bounds.size.width);
    NSLog(@""CONTENT SIZE  %f, %f"",  self.contentSize.height, self.contentSize.width);

    CGRect rc = [self bounds];
    NSLog(@""%f %f"", rc.size.height, rc.size.width);
    CGRect newRect = CGRectMake(rc.origin.x, rc.origin.y + self.contentSize.height, self.contentSize.width, fabs(tPoint.y - previousYPan));
    NSLog(@""BOND RECT %f, %f, %f, %f"", rc.origin.x, rc.origin.y, rc.size.height, rc.size.width);
    NSLog(@""NEW RECT %f, %f, %f, %f"", newRect.origin.x, newRect.origin.y, newRect.size.height, newRect.size.width);
    //[self scrollRectToVisible:newRect animated:YES];
    NSLog(@""Content OFFSET %f"",tPoint.y - previousYPan);
    [self setContentOffset:CGPointMake(rc.origin.x,(tPoint.y - previousYPan) *2.0 )animated:YES];
    previousYPan = tPoint.y;
    //[super touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event];
    //[[self nextResponder] touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event];
}

<p>But the result is really laggy and buggy. Any better idea?</p>

<pre><code>#include&lt;vector&gt;

<p>Unfortunately, <code>output vect_dbg(test)</code> breaks the debugging. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The program being debugged was signaled while in a function called
  from GDB. GDB has restored the context to what it was before the call.
  To change this behavior use ""set unwindonsignal off"" Evaluation of the
  expression containing the function (vect_dbg(std::vector > const&amp;)) will be abandoned. Program received
  signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. 0x004014b1 in vect_dbg
  (V=@0x22ff34) at main.cpp:16</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I discovered that the function works if I make <code>test</code> global, but i couldn't figure out a solution for the locally defined vector. How can i solve this? Many thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT: Mainly solved, the answer was pretty obvious, the vector wasn't initialized at breakpoint. Now i am wondering if it's possible to detect that in <code>vect_dbg</code>. 
An alternative i found is to declare the <code>vector&lt;int&gt;</code> static.</p>

  /**
   * Custom JSF ResourceHandler.
   * 
   * This handler bridges between Spring MVC and JSF managed resources. The handler takes
   * care of the case when a JSF facelet is used as a view by a Spring MVC Controller and the
   * view uses components like h:outputScript and h:outputStylesheet by correctly pointing the 
   * resource URLs generated to the JSF resource handler.
   * 
   * The reason this custom handler wrapper is needed is because the JSF internal logic assumes
   * that the request URL for the current page/view is a JSF url. If it is a Spring MVC request, JSF
   * will create URLs that incorrectly includes the Spring controller context.
   * 
   * This handler will strip out the Spring context for the URL and add the "".jsf"" suffix, so the
   * resource request will be routed to the FacesServlet with a correct resource context (assuming the
   * faces servlet is mapped to the *.jsf pattern).

<p>I've tried using <code>ClientCredentialApplicator.NetworkCredential</code>, it didn't work. Then per the advice <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13623865/dotnetopenauth-clientidentifier-authorising"">here</a>, I've made my own <code>ClientCredentialApplicator</code>.</p>

<p>I still didn't work, I put breakpoints in <code>ApplyClientCredential</code> and they never hit.</p>

<p>I upgraded to the latest version (4.3.0.0), which should have <a href=""https://github.com/AArnott/dotnetopenid/commit/84ef4b74365fe78156792cf17bb945a9ace4e03f"">this fix</a>.</p>

<p>Everything works but there's no <code>Authorization</code> header, and the remote server answers with 301 error (which makes me think it is the same problem as the commit - the Authorization info is not added to the request until the server answers with <code>Unauthorized</code> and the provider I'm using answers with 301 when there's no <code>Authorization</code> header)</p>

<p>p holds a copy of a (presumably valid) address, so free(p) tries to, well, free it. But since it is a copy, it cannot really free it. How does the call to free() know that it cannot really free it ? </p>

<p>I have an array of movie clips called    ""_main.speederArray""    and i'm trying to make it so that if they collide with each other then they are both destroyed. Here is my code in the ""Speeder class"" to detect collision.</p>

<pre><code>private function detectionHandler():void{
        //trace(""array length"", _main.speederArray.length);
        detectionID = _main.gameCounter;
        for ( var i:int = _main.speederArray.length -1; i &gt;= 0; i--){

            var speeder:Speeder = _main.speederArray[i];

            if(speeder.destroyMe) continue;
            if(speeder.detectionID == this.detectionID) continue;

            if (boxIntersect(this, speeder)){

                    trace(""collision"");

                    destroyMe = true;
                    speeder.destroyMe = true;
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the boxIntersect function this code refers to. It's in the same class</p>

<pre><code>private function boxIntersect ( speeder1:Speeder, speeder2:Speeder):Boolean{

        if(speeder1.x + speeder1.distRight &lt; speeder2.x + speeder2.distLeft) return false; //checking for overlap on X axis
        if(speeder1.x + speeder1.distLeft &gt; speeder2.x + speeder2.distRight) return false;
        if(speeder1.y + speeder1.distBot &lt; speeder2.y + speeder2.distTop) return false; // checking for overlap on Y axis
        if(speeder1.y + speeder1.distTop &gt; speeder2.y + speeder2.distBot) return false;



        return true;

    }
</code></pre>

<p>And then here is where i think the problem is. I have a class called ""spawner"" and this is where i was going to handle the objects being created and destroyed. Here is the code where i am trying to splice objects from the array depending on whether the destroyMe bool is set to true. At this stage i have confused the shit out of myself so any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<pre><code>    private function updateArray(e:Event):void{

        for(var i:int = _main.speederArray.length - 1; i&gt;=0; i--){


            var speeder:Speeder = _main.speederArray[i];


            if(speeder.destroyMe){
                //trace(""hello"");
                removeChild(speeder[i]); // take it off the stage
                _main.speederArray[i] = null;
                _main.speederArray.splice(i, 1); //remove it from the array
            }

        }


    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the game runs however as soon as the 2 objects within the same array collide, i get the collision trace in the output window but straight after i get this :</p>

<p>ReferenceError: Error #1069: Property 1 not found on com.game.Speeder and there is no default value.

<p>The problem is how I should 'break' away from the validation steps. I have tried to return JsonResponse from a validation method but it will continue the get or post method before actually returning any response resulting in errors. I can set a class error and message but that wil mean a lot of if/else checks in the get or post method..</p>

<p>I am basically looking for a class architecture that lets me run validation methods that could have one or two return values.. I think I might have to create my own error handler, but I don't have a clear example.</p>

  }

} 
</code></pre>

<p>The testing file has our Injector and the S3Client instances as a PhpUnit MockObject. To mock S3Client we must disable original constructor with the Mock Builder.  </p>

<p>To mock S3Client:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;s3Client = $this-&gt;getMockBuilder('Aws\S3\S3Client')-&gt;disableOriginalConstructor()-&gt;getMock();
</code></pre>

<p>To configure inner putObject call (case to test with putObject throw S3Exception, but we have the same problem with $this->returnValue($expected).</p>

<p>To init Test Class and configure sut:</p>

<pre><code>  public function setUp()
  {
    $this-&gt;s3Client = $this-&gt;getMockBuilder('Aws\S3\S3Client')-&gt;disableOriginalConstructor()-&gt;getMock();
    $this-&gt;injector = $this-&gt;getMock('core\lib\Injector');
  }

  public function configureSut()
  {
    return new AwsWrapper($this-&gt;injector, $this-&gt;s3Client);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Not working code:</p>

<pre><code>$expectedArray = array(
  'Bucket' =&gt; Aws::getInstance()-&gt;getBucket(),
  'Key'    =&gt; $key,
  'Body'   =&gt; $body,
  'ACL'    =&gt; 'public-read',
);
$this-&gt;s3Client-&gt;expects($timesPutObject)
  -&gt;method('putObject')
  -&gt;with($expectedArray)
  -&gt;will($this-&gt;throwException(new S3Exception($exceptionMessage, $exceptionCode)));
$this-&gt;configureSut()-&gt;uploadFile($key, $filePath);
</code></pre>

<p>When we execute our test function, the injected S3Client doesn't throw the exception or return the expected value, always return NULL.  </p>

<p>With xdebug we have seen taht the S3Client MockObject is configured correctly but doesn't works as is configured at will().  </p>

<p>A ""solution"" (or a bad solution)could be doing a S3ClientWrapper, this will only move the problem to other Class that couldn't be unit tested with mocks.</p>

<p>Any idea?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, that the same form works without any glitches in ruby 2.1.2 and rails 4.1.5.</p>

<p>Any advice or workaround would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Best regards,
Luka</p>

<p>UPDATE:
even if i go through console:</p>

<pre><code>l=Location.last
</code></pre>

<p>Returns last location</p>

<pre><code>l.location_images.find(11)
</code></pre>

<p>returns the corresponding record. If then i go</p>

<pre><code>l.location_images.find(11).destroy
</code></pre>

<p>I get the same error as when running a server. Is it possible that this is due to something i have done wrong or is it a bug?</p>

<p>When i send data using the client HTML Page the data goes to server and comes back as its supposed to but the process becomes recurrent and i get the same recieved more then once on both the sides i mean the server and the client ..</p>

<p>say. if i send ""hello"" from client it recieves 2-3 ""hello"" back on client side from server.. an importing thing that i just noticed is the number of recurrsions increases everytime i send a data to server.</p>

<p>Anyone got a clue on whats wrong ? </p>

<p>Why is MPI model at odds with NUMA architecture? </p>

<p>To me, <code>NUMA</code> is an architecture where memory is local to CPUs, and MPI is a protocol for message passing. </p>

<p>What is referred to as <code>MPI Native model</code> when dealing with heterogeneous architecture is the end-to-end communication using MPI with all the cores in each processor / co-processor. </p>

<p>I have a list of strings and images and I want to display them uniquely such that the image displays with a frame and strings display in a textbox to be edited.  I made an ItemTemplateSelector and select the template based on the type.  However I want to add some controls, like a button to delete and a checkbox to display selection to both templates.  </p>

<p>I know I can add both objects to both templates for strings or images, but I want it to be able to scale and not have to added each time I add a template.  Any thoughts?</p>

<p>We want to assign an attribute whose contents already contain entities like <code>&amp;quot;</code> or <code>&amp;amp;</code>.
<br />
In this example, we want the title attribute to be <code>Stack ""Stacky"" Overflow</code>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>$elem = $xml.CreateElement(""Site"");
$elem.SetAttribute(""Title"", ""Stack &amp;quot;Stacky&amp;quot; Overflow"");
</code></pre>

<p>But that turns into the following piece of XML output:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;Site Title=""Stack &amp;amp;quot;Stacky&amp;amp;quot; Overflow"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>

<p>That behaviour is even stated in the documentation about the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y1ah1zbw.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">XmlElement.SetAttribute Method</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to assign an attribute value that contains entity references,
  the user must create an <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlattribute.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">XmlAttribute</a> node plus any <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmltext.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">XmlText</a> and
  <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlentityreference.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">XmlEntityReference</a> nodes, build the appropriate subtree and use
  <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlelement.setattributenode.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">SetAttributeNode</a> to assign it as the value of an attribute.</p>

I'm researching if this could be done without asynchronous. </p>

<p><strong>To be noted: NON-BLOCKING  != ASYNCHRONOUS</strong>:)</p>

<p>Therefore I have the following approach by turning off the blocking flag of socket &amp; Poll() method:</p>

<pre><code>    try
    {
        IPEndPoint hostEp = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(""127.0.0.1""), 11000);
        Socket hostSock = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);
        hostSock.Blocking = false;
        hostSock.Connect(hostEp);

    }
    catch (Win32Exception se)
    {
        if (ex.ErrorCode == 10035) // WSAEWOULDBLOCK is expected, means connect is in progress
        while (true)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Connecting in progress"");
            bool connected = hostSock.Poll(1000000, SelectMode.SelectWrite);
            if (connected)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(""Connected"");
                break;
            }

        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>But then SelectMode.SelectWrite doesn't seems reinitiates an connection attempts for me. So, what's the problem? And how could I solve this?

<p>The trouble is I don't know when <strong>onDisconnect</strong> event would be fired?!</p>

<p>Every time I open the app I write TRUE to the node ""<strong>users/joe/connections</strong>"" but when I closed app nothing would be happend. 
When I switched WIFI off then the boolean parameter wouldn't be removed as well. 
onDisconnect-event only fired when I forcely stopped my app or reinstalled this app or somewhen else when I couldn`t determine.</p>

<p>The article, is at <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386921.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Creating a DataTable From a Query (LINQ to DataSet)</a>, with code in particular-</p>

<pre><code>// Create a sequence. 
Item[] items = new Item[] { 
  new Book{Id = 1, Price = 13.50, Genre = ""Comedy"", Author = ""Gustavo Achong""}, 
  new Book{Id = 2, Price = 8.50, Genre = ""Drama"", Author = ""Jessie Zeng""},
  new Movie{Id = 1, Price = 22.99, Genre = ""Comedy"", Director = ""Mary Barnes""},
  new Movie{Id = 1, Price = 13.40, Genre = ""Action"", Director = ""Emmanuel Black""}
};

// Query for items with price greater than 9.99.
var query = from i in items
             where i.Price &gt; 9.99
             orderby i.Price
             select i;

// Load the query results into new DataTable.
DataTable table = query.CopyToDataTable();
</code></pre>

<p>Seems simple enough.  Object array with subclasses of book and movie, seems to be convertible to DataRow, which is what CopyToDataTable runs off.</p>

<p>But my object array, which I store in a var, doesn't allow me to use the CopyToDataTable method.  I would have thought my object 'qryData' is very similar to the above 'items'....</p>

<pre><code>var qryData =
    sdTable.AsEnumerable().Cast&lt;DataRow&gt;()
           .OrderByDescending(t =&gt; t[c.ColumnName] == DBNull.Value
                                    ? 0 : Convert.ToSingle(t[c.ColumnName]))
           .GroupBy(t =&gt; t[""DAT_ID""])
           .Select(g =&gt; new {g, count = g.Count()})
           .SelectMany(x =&gt; x.g.Select(b =&gt; b)
                                .Zip(Enumerable.Range(1, x.count), (j, i) =&gt; new {
                                   inst = j[""DAT_ID""],
                                   idn = j[""ID_NUM""],
                                   val = j[c.ColumnName],
                                   tdt = dailyCount[Convert.ToInt32(j[""DAT_ID""])],
                                   rn = i
                                 })
             );
</code></pre>

<p>Query works fine, comes back with big collection of '(inst,idn,val,tdt,rn)', but can't use CopyToDataTable on it. {method is not available}  Adding a .ToArray() or .AsEnumerable() doesn't help either.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Quick note,
I have included System.Data, thinking that the .CopyToDataTable() method was available in that.  I tried to include System.Data.DataTableExtensions - but not there.  Then I tried to include System.Data.DataSetExtensions as a (.NET) reference in my project -- but hasn't helped.</p>

<p>What they want me to do is to have the previous/next buttons and autoplay to all move the slider one slide at a time in all modes (mobile, tablet, and desktop). Ok not a problem, I set that up easily enough. Then they asked me to change it so that it displays one dot for every 3 slides and clicking those dots moves the slider 3 slides at a time.</p>

<p>Obviously this is going to require me making modifications to the functions in slick.js. I don't see any built in functionality to do this. I am trying to figure out how to extend this library and override the functions one at a time. To be honest I am not sure how to do this properly with jQuery plugins.</p>

<p>I have a client and a server java program.
Each one establishes and manages a ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream with the other.</p>

<p>I want to be able to send objects (Given all objects sent will extend a Packet class I made).
The issue is that even though the client and server may have the exact same code for the packet class, I am getting a error:</p>

<p>It appears that java thinks that the Packet class on the server is a different class on the client.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can fix this (Aside from having the same package names on both the client and server)?</p>

<p>I can get the element. Problem is i need to check this element and if something is true it returns another element i need to put back into the list. It does check correctly and it changes correctly.</p>

<p>Problem i am having is how do i create a completely new list.</p>

<p>So, if i had</p>

<p>I go through each element. say i get to the 6 and it changes. So i need to create a new list like so,</p>

<pre><code>[[1,1,1],[2,10,2],[3,3,3]].
</code></pre>

<p>Right now my main problem is just creating each row. If i can create each row, i will be able to create a list of lists.</p>

<p>So to break this down a little more, lets just worry about [1,1,1].</p>

<p>I go through each element while appending the new element to a newlist. the new list is now [1,1,1]</p>

<p>I have this:</p>

<pre><code>set(Row,Col,Bin,TheEntry,Bout) :- 
 append(ListLeft, [R|_], Bin),
  append(ListLeft2, [C|_], R),
   length(ListLeft, LenR),
   length(ListLeft2,LenC),
   CurrRow is LenR + 1,
   CurrCol is LenC + 1,
   getChar(C, Row, Col, CurrRow, CurrCol,TheEntry, NewC),
            appendhere?.

<p>I need to create a new list there with the character returned from NewC. Not sure how to do this.</p>

Nowhere do you see that I'm about to do this, that I want to do this, that I'm unclear of the myriad of reasons not to do this... but still some of you feel compelled to be priggish and concern yourselves with how much smarter you are rather than take the question for what its worth and offer something useful.</p>

<p>Most groups of values have names, the values from 1-24 are known as hours, from 1-12 Months, etc. But for AM/PM what's the name for group, for the collection, for the domain... and they are clearly not ""meridiem"" because that is the name of a single point in time Noon.

<p>UITableViewController > Rooms > Chat Conversation</p>

<p>The problem is. I think on [nav popViewControllerAnimated:NO]; because it performs well the push segue to the same VC from one conversation to another conversation. But it crashes when I hi back button. its performing the push from rootViewControler but cant find its way to Rooms when I hit back.</p>

<p>CODE:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)DisplayNewMessage:(NSNotification *) notification {

    NSDictionary* userInfo = notification.userInfo;

    UITabBarController *tab = self;
    [tab setSelectedIndex:2];
    UINavigationController *nav = tab.viewControllers[2];

<p>This inbox is getting thousands of emails a day, and I can't delete any emails for 30 days. For the initial import I was just doing an offset from the beginning of the inbox, but obviously that won't work once we start cleaning out emails.</p>

<p>I think I have to set the $Restriction property of the class ""<a href=""https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews/blob/master/EWSType/FindItemType.php"" rel=""nofollow"">EWSType_FindItemType</a>"", but I don't think the necessary classes exist in <a href=""https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews"" rel=""nofollow"">php-ews</a> for me to do this. I've tried to add them myself, but I don't understand enough about EWS or SOAP.</p>

<p>So far the only thing I've come up with is this:</p>

<pre><code>$Request-&gt;Restriction = new EWSType_RestrictionType();
$Request-&gt;Restriction-&gt;IsGreaterThan = new stdClass;

strArray[0] = (localisation_t* ) malloc(sizeof(localisation_t));

<p>I have often seen that a struct member can allocate memory too. I don't understand what for because you already allocate memory for the struct ?! But ok you don't know what it will contains.
 (<a href=""http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex16.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> an example with <em>strdup</em> on the name variable member).
Is it a good practice to allocate memory for member of struct (mostly when it's char * type) ?</p>

<p>As you can see, July has an initializer of 0.
This has some interesting (side) effects: there seems to be ""pairing"" of integer values. February Ã nd August now have values of 1, March Ã nd September have 2 etc.:</p>

<pre><code>MonthOfTheYear theMonth = MonthOfTheYear.February;
Console.WriteLine(theMonth + "" has integer value of "" + (int)theMonth);

<pre><code>MonthOfTheYear theMonth = MonthOfTheYear.August;
Console.WriteLine(theMonth + "" has integer value of "" + (int)theMonth);
</code></pre>

<p>clearly show this. So far, weird as I find that, I'm willing to go along.
<strong>EDIT:</strong> I get that assigning July 0 makes the indices start over. I DON'T get why they can co-exist within the same enum.</p>

<p>BUT! IF I then loop through the enum and output all the underlying integer values, weirdness ensues.</p>

<pre><code>MonthOfTheYear theMonth = MonthOfTheYear.January;

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 12; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(theMonth + "" has integer value of "" + (int)theMonth++);

7 has integer value of 7
8 has integer value of 8
9 has integer value of 9
10 has integer value of 10
11 has integer value of 11

<p>this part is easy.</p>

<p>I'm usually tempted to do most of the GUI resizing by hand but I read in the doc of the JScrollPane that it is better to let swing handle it rather than manually changing the dimension.</p>

<p>the problem is that I keep adding element and the inside panel doesn't change size.</p>

<p>any ideas?</p>

        super(d);
        Dimension d2 = new Dimension(100,300);

        this.setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(0, 0, 0, 0));
        //INSIDE VIEW (zone that is being scrolled)
        container = new SideBarContainer(d2);

//      container.setSize(d2);
//      container.setPreferredSize(d2);
//      container.setMaximumSize(d2);
//      container.setMinimumSize(d2);


        scrollPane = new MyJScrollPane(container);

        scrollPane.setMinimumSize(d3);
        scrollPane.setPreferredSize(d3);

        add(scrollPane,BorderLayout.PAGE_START);
        setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder());
}
</code></pre>

<p>Adding to container:</p>

<pre><code>element = new JPanel();
        Dimension d2 = new Dimension(100,100);

        element.setSize(d2);
        element.setPreferredSize(d2);
        element.setMaximumSize(d2);

        element.setBackground((panelcount++%2==0)?Color.BLUE:Color.RED);
        cointainer.add(element);

});
    }
</code></pre>

<p>But I get this error: 
    ReferenceError: startLng is not defined</p>

<p>I understand it is related to the fact that I need a callback to read them, but I can't figure out how to do this.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>  Just to clarify, my function works fine generating the Fibonacci numbers. I just wanted to add a counter inside the function so I can see how many times it is being called every time I want it to generate a Fibonacci number.</p>

<p>I have since tried one of the methods below where I initialise a counter in the main function then increment it in the recursion but don't know if the number is correct. For example it is saying that I'm calling the function 609 times if my Fibonacci number is 610, is that correct?</p>

I've been having a lot of trouble trying to highlighting the ""active"" tab on a navbar i am using. I'm trying to do this through CSS but the problem arises when I change pages. I will add the following code:
<br/>
<code>
function updateMenu(num)<br/>
{</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>var menuCode = </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>'<code>&lt;ul id=""menu""&gt;</code>' + <br/>
    '<code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""software/menu.php"" onclick=""updateMenu(1);""';</code> <br/>
    <code>if(num == 1){menuCode +=' class=""current""';}</code> <br/> 
    <code>menuCode += '&gt;Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;'</code>+ <br/>
    '<code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""users/menu.php"" onclick=""updateMenu(2);""';</code> <br/>
    <code>if(num == 2){menuCode +=' class=""current""';}</code> <br/> 
    <code>menuCode += '&gt;Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;';</code><br/></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>document.getElementById(""cssMenu"").innerHTML = menuCode;
<br/>}
</code></p>

<p>And my list goes as follows:
<code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;ul id=""menu""&gt;</code></p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""software/menu.php"" onclick=""updateMenu(1);""&gt;Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code>
    <code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""user/menu.php"" onclick=""updateMenu(2);""&gt;Users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code>
    <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code>
    </code></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel it's an unelegant solution because of all the code wrote in the updateMenu function and i was wondering if there was a more elegant solution to my problem. (You can see it's on moving the ""class=current"" so the CSS works properly).</p>

<p>now I need to display a bar graph that runs on the following script</p>

<pre><code>select trim(vendor)||' '||trim(location)||' '||trim(type1) AS vendor_location,
       count(distinct control_objective) as ""Cont Obj""

2----Big Red Car----------4

<p>The problem is, there might be a <strong>5th</strong> vendor, say <strong>Big White Van</strong> which has no values in the objective field hence it is not displayed. But I want it to be displayed as follows.</p>

1----Big Blue Car---------5
2----Big Red Car----------4
3----Small Pink Truck-----4
4----Small White Truck----2
5----Big White Van--------0
</code></pre>

<p>Reason being, the script feeds values into a bar graph, so I need the value 0 on the graph. I've tried several ways of overcoming this which is posted below</p>

<pre><code>select trim(vendor)||' '||trim(location)||' '||trim(type1) AS vendor_location,
       count(distinct nvl(control_objective,0)) as ""Cont Obj""

      Quarter = 'Q3'
group by trim(vendor)||' '||trim(location)||' '||trim(type1)
order by trim(vendor)||' '||trim(location)||' '||trim(type1);
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>select trim(vendor)||' '||trim(location)||' '||trim(type1) AS vendor_location,
       (count(distinct control_objective)+0) as ""Cont Obj"" from some_table
where (Rating = 'Needs improvement' or Rating = 'Unacceptable') and 
      ""Year"" = '2011' and 
      Quarter = 'Q3'
group by trim(vendor)||' '||trim(location)||' '||trim(type1)
order by trim(vendor)||' '||trim(location)||' '||trim(type1);
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>select trim(vendor)||' '||trim(location)||' '||trim(type1) AS vendor_location,
       case when (count(distinct control_objective)&lt;1) 
            then 0 
            else count(distinct control_objective) 
       end as ""Cont Obj"" 
from some_table
where (Rating = 'Needs improvement' or Rating = 'Unacceptable') and 
      ""Year"" = '2011' and 
      Quarter = 'Q3'
group by trim(vendor)||' '||trim(location)||' '||trim(type1)
order by trim(vendor)||' '||trim(location)||' '||trim(type1);
</code></pre>

<p>All the above attempts gave me the same output as I got earlier.</p>

<p>Honestly, I can't think of any more ways. The <strong>last option</strong> I have is to write the output into a table, and manually enter the missing values and then display the table. But this is really not what I want because the script should work for future quarters and years. So in the future some other value may be null and writing and reading into a table defeats the purpose of being ""future-proof"" so basically its not an option, just a quick-fix for the coming deadline.</p>

<p>I am using <strong>SQL Developer</strong> to test the scripts and the database is <strong>Oracle 11g</strong></p>

<p>P.S. If it is not possible, do let me know. I'm even open to that being an answer!! I don't have much experience with SQL.</p>

<p>The workbook includes 4 worksheets (Product1, Product2, Product3, Warehouses). The Warehouses sheet contains the following formula to populate an inventory list for each warehouse from the three product worksheets (derived from <a href=""http://exceltactics.com/make-filtered-list-sub-arrays-excel-using-small/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://exceltactics.com/make-filtered-list-sub-arrays-excel-using-small/</a>). This is the formula in cell B3:</p>

<pre><code>=IFERROR(INDEX(INDIRECT(B$2&amp;""!B$3:B$400""),SMALL(IF(INDIRECT(B$2&amp;""!$C$3:$C$400"")=$B$1,ROW(INDIRECT(B$2&amp;""!B$3:B$400""))-ROW(INDIRECT(B$2&amp;""!B$3""))+1),ROWS(Product1!$B$3:$B3))),"""")
</code></pre>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>Warehouses-->$B$1 = Warehouse1 or Warehouse2</p>

<p>Warehouses-->B2, C2, D2 = Column headers for Product1, Product2, Product3</p>

<p>Product Sheets-->Column B = Serial #</p>

<p>Product Sheets-->Column C = Location (Warehouse1, Warehouse2)</p>

<p>Currently, I have to amend the last part of the formula for each row: <code>ROWS(Product1!$B$3:$B3)</code>, <code>ROWS(Product2!$B$3:$B3)</code> , <code>ROWS(Product3!$B$3:$B3)</code>.I am trying to dynamically link it to the column header like the other parts of the code (e.g. <code>ROW(INDIRECT(B$2&amp;""!B$3:B$400""))</code>. I'm stuck though because the range <code>$B3</code> has to change with each row, whereas the others are static and are fine enclosed in the quotations.</p>

<p>This effort is important because I want less capable users to be able to copy the formula to new columns without having to amend it. Appreciate any thoughts on this!</p>

<p>What I'm doing now:</p>

<pre><code>char ipstr[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN];
struct sockaddr_in *s = (struct sockaddr_in *)&amp;addr;
inet_ntop(AF_INET, &amp;s-&gt;sin_addr, ipstr, sizeof ipstr);
</code></pre>

<p>So if I print that I have the IP from the client that just connected to the server. </p>

<p>Now this is where I believe I'm doing it dumb. As of right now, I'm using that as an ID to identify the subscriptor (the client that just connected). But I have several problems with that, the main one being, what happens if by chance I get two address that are the same (as a dumb example, I'm using my own code carefully since I connect to myself thus using 127.0.0.1).</p>

<p>And I thought: I could put both address AND port to identify who is the subscriber.</p>

<p>And thus the idea of adding an int to that buffer. Obviously I'd have to create a slightly bigger buffer, but the thing is, I don't really know how to... ""put"" the int in there.</p>

<p>And please if anyone could tell me a better idea to identify clients/subscribers I'd be glad, I've thought of many stupid ideas and all give minor trouble like this.</p>

<p>To add to this, I know what number the port is after the creation of this buffer of course, so I thought of doing </p>

<pre><code>char nombreSubscriptor[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN+sizeof(int)];
</code></pre>

<p>but if I did that I believe it wouldnt be space enough, once I change the int to string or char array or whatever.</p>

    padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px;
    border: none;
    font-family: Arial;
    font-size: 9px;
    text-decoration: none;
    text-align: left;
    }
html, body {
    background-color: red;
    }
#map{
    position:relative;
}
#legend{
  position:absolute;
  top: 1%;
  left: 100px;
}

<p>This works just fine in Firefox, Safari and Chrome, but not in IE8. </p>

<p>In IE8 the legend is shown in its place, the red page background is behind but the map div has disappeared. Note that IE still loads the map tiles etc but seems to be putting them either behind the background or somewhere not on the screen... </p>

<p>If you have any suggestions, greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>m.insert(make_pair(key, val));
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, which operation is faster?
People usually say the first one is slower, because the STL Standard at first 'insert' a default element if 'key' is not existing in map and then assign 'val' to the default element.</p>

<p>But I don't see the second way is better because of 'make_pair'. make_pair actually is a convenient way to make 'pair' compared to <code>pair&lt;T1, T2&gt;(key, val)</code>. Anyway, both of them do two assignments, one is assigning 'key' to 'pair.first' and two is assigning 'val' to 'pair.second'. After pair is made, map inserts the element initialized by 'pair.second'.</p>

<p>So the first way is 1. '<code>default construct of typeof(val)</code>' 2. assignment
the second way is 1. assignment 2. '<code>copy construct of typeof(val)</code>'</p>

<p>I'm trying to make external authentication work with default Web API template project. I used the following instructions to add support for external authentication services (FB/Google/Microsoft): <a href=""http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/security/external-authentication-services"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/security/external-authentication-services</a></p>

<p>Just for the record, I was able to make external authentication work with default SPA template project.
Also, new local user creation works fine.</p>

<p>The problem appeared once I tried to use my client app (WPF-based) to register user using external provider (e.g., FB). </p>

<p>For the record, I used these two articles as the starting point: <a href=""http://leastprivilege.com/2013/11/26/dissecting-the-web-api-individual-accounts-templatepart-3-external-accounts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leastprivilege.com/2013/11/26/dissecting-the-web-api-individual-accounts-templatepart-3-external-accounts/</a> and thread #21065648 here at Stack Overflow.
They really helped me to understand the entire logic.</p>

<p>here's the short overview of the steps I've done:
two windows, main and the one for external authentication provider, with embedded WebBrowser
the flow:
2.1. user opens an app, main window appears
2.2. user clicks on a button to get the list of all supported external authentication providers,
and here's what happens in the code:</p>

<pre><code>            var client = new HttpClient();

            client.BaseAddress = new Uri(baseAddress);
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Clear();
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue(""application/json""));

            HttpResponseMessage loginResponse = await client.GetAsync(""api/Account/ExternalLogins?returnUrl=%2F&amp;generateState=true"");
            if (loginResponse.IsSuccessStatusCode)
            {
            var externalLoginProviders = await loginResponse.Content.ReadAsAsync&lt;IEnumerable&lt;AuthenticationProvider&gt;&gt;();

            // cleaning resources
            client.Dispose();
            loginResponse.Dispose();

            // obtained data is sent to UI
</code></pre>

<p>This leads to the list of External Authentication Providers, with name, url, and state. URL is relative, and is used as the redirect to the actual provider (e.g., FB, or Google).</p>

<p>2.3. As soon as the list with external authentication providers is populated, user can enter his/her email, and click on the ""Login"" button, which will lead to the following:</p>

<p>In second window, with embedded WebBrowser, the latter is Navigated to the provided URL obtained in the previous step. If user logs successfully into the selected provider (e.g., Facebook), and agrees to give my app (Facebook app) necessary permissions (profile), user is navigated back to our website, in the form:</p>

<pre><code>            (our base url) /#access_token=XXX&amp;token_type=bearer&amp;expires=YYY
</code></pre>

<p>This address is then parsed and address params (token, etc.) are saved in the structured form for later use.</p>

<p>Right after that I go to <em>api/UserInfo</em> to understand if user already logged on with this external authentication provider or not:</p>

<pre><code>            var client = new HttpClient();

            client.BaseAddress = new Uri(baseAddress);
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Clear();
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue(""application/json""));

            // setting Bearer Token obtained from Auth provider
            client.SetBearerToken(result.AccessToken);

            // calling /api/Account/UserInfo
            var userInfoResponse = await client.GetAsync(""api/Account/UserInfo"");
            var userInfoMessage = userInfoResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;

            var userInfo = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;UserInfo&gt;(userInfoMessage);

            // cleaning resources
            client.Dispose();
            userInfoResponse.Dispose();

            if (userInfo.hasRegistered == true)
            {
                // going to login
            }   
</code></pre>

<p>Right after that, assuming that our user didn't create a user based on his/her login with the given external authentication provider (e.g., FB), yet, we do the following:</p>

<pre><code>            var data = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();
            data.Add(""Email"", this.externalUserEmailTextBox.Text);

            var registerExternalUrl = new Uri(string.Concat(baseAddress, @""api/Account/RegisterExternal""));

            var client = new HttpClient();

            client.BaseAddress = new Uri(baseAddress);

            // setting Bearer Token obtained from External Authentication provider
            client.SetBearerToken(result.AccessToken);

            var response = client.PostAsync(registerExternalUrl.ToString(), new FormUrlEncodedContent(data)).Result;
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, user should be created (I have zero changes on the service side apart of uncommenting provider's app id and app secret lines in Startup.Auth.cs).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't happen at all. Instead, I get ""Internal Server Error"" which means that this line,</p>

<pre><code>            var info = await Authentication.GetExternalLoginInfoAsync();
</code></pre>

<p>brings null, and so system fails to Authentication correctly with the provided Bearer Token. </p>

<p>I can't understand why. It seems that something is broken in the framework, or I'm doing something wrong...</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to @berhir, here's the solution:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In MainWindow.xaml.cs, define cookieContainer</p>

<pre><code>        CookieContainer cookieContainer;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In MainWindow_Loaded event handler, instantiate it:</p>

<pre><code>        // we create new cookie container
        cookieContainer = new CookieContainer();
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>As soon as user asks app to show all external login providers, instantiate HttpClient using suggested code by @berhir:</p>

<pre><code>        using (var handler = new HttpClientHandler() { CookieContainer = cookieContainer })
        using (var client = new HttpClient(handler) { BaseAddress = baseAddress })
        {
            // send request
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Clear();
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue(""application/json""));

            HttpResponseMessage loginResponse = await client.GetAsync(""api/Account/ExternalLogins?returnUrl=%2F&amp;generateState=true"");
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>As soon as list of external auth providers is obtained, the next step is to show second window, with embedded WebBrowser. There, you'll have to declare two WinAPI calls for cookies:</p>

<pre><code>        [DllImport(""wininet.dll"", CharSet = CharSet.Auto, SetLastError = true)]
        public static extern bool InternetSetCookie(string lpszUrlName, string lbszCookieName, string lpszCookieData);

        [DllImport(""wininet.dll"", SetLastError = true)]
        public static extern bool InternetGetCookieEx(string url, string cookieName, StringBuilder cookieData, ref int size, Int32 dwFlags, IntPtr lpReserved); 

        // and

        private const Int32 InternetCookieHttponly = 0x2000;

        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// Gets the URI cookie container.
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        /// &lt;param name=""uri""&gt;The URI.&lt;/param&gt;
        /// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
        public static CookieContainer GetUriCookieContainer(Uri uri)
        {
            CookieContainer cookies = null;
            // Determine the size of the cookie
            int datasize = 8192 * 16;
            StringBuilder cookieData = new StringBuilder(datasize);
            if (!InternetGetCookieEx(uri.ToString(), null, cookieData, ref datasize, InternetCookieHttponly, IntPtr.Zero))
            {
                if (datasize &lt; 0)
                return null;
                // Allocate stringbuilder large enough to hold the cookie
                cookieData = new StringBuilder(datasize);
                if (!InternetGetCookieEx(uri.ToString(), null, cookieData, ref datasize, InternetCookieHttponly, IntPtr.Zero))
                    return null;
            }
            if (cookieData.Length &gt; 0)
            {
                cookies = new CookieContainer();
                cookies.SetCookies(uri, cookieData.ToString().Replace(';', ','));
            }
            return cookies;
        }
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>This window with embedded browser is instantiated, and constructor accepts several params, including start URL (to external auth provider), end URL (resulting with ""#access_token=..."" or ""error..."", callback, and, even more important, with the original cookieContainer. We use <em>InternetSetCookie</em> WinAPI method to pass that original cookieContainer to WebBrowser's session:</p>

<pre><code>    // set cookies
    var cookies = cookieContainer.GetCookies(baseAddress).OfType&lt;Cookie&gt;().ToList();
    foreach (var cookie in cookies)
    {
        InternetSetCookie(startUrl, cookie.Name, cookie.Value); 
    } 
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>So, once user succeeds with signing into the selected external auth provider (e.g., Facebook), updated cookieContainer (which includes cookies set in the first HttpClient call, as well as right within WebBrowser right after signing in to external auth provider) obtained using <em>InternetGetCookieEx</em> WinAPI call, is sent back to MainWindow.xaml.cs via callback:</p>

<pre><code>        if (this.callback != null)
        {
            var cookies = GetUriCookieContainer(e.Uri);

            this.callback(new AuthResult(e.Uri, this.providerName, cookies));
        }
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>There, we issue two new requests, to <em>api/Account/UserInfo</em>, and then to <em>api/Account/RegisterExternal</em>:</p>

<pre><code>        this.cookieContainer = result.CookieContainer; // where result is AuthResult containing the cookies obtained from WebBrowser's session

        using (var handler = new HttpClientHandler() { CookieContainer = cookieContainer })
        using (var client = new HttpClient(handler) { BaseAddress = baseAddress })
        {
            // send request
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Clear();
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue(""application/json""));

            // setting Bearer Token obtained from Auth provider
            client.SetBearerToken(result.AccessToken);

            // calling /api/Account/UserInfo
            var userInfoResponse = await client.GetAsync(""api/Account/UserInfo"");

            var userInfo = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;UserInfo&gt;(userInfoMessage);

        if (userInfo.hasRegistered == false)
        {
            var data = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();
            data.Add(""Email"", this.externalUserEmailTextBox.Text);

            var registerExternalUrl = new Uri(string.Concat(baseAddress, @""api/Account/RegisterExternal""));

            var content = new FormUrlEncodedContent(data);

            var response = client.PostAsync(registerExternalUrl.ToString(), content).Result;

            // obtaining content
            var responseContent = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;

            if (response != null &amp;&amp; response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
            {
                MessageBox.Show(""New user registered, with "" + result.ProviderName + "" account"");
            }
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>So, here we go. Cookies are used within the whole lifecycle, from first HttpClient request to the final moment when we register a new user using <em>api/account/registerExternal</em>.</p>

There is a class named singleton implemented by singleton pattern as following, in file singleton.h:</p>

<pre><code>/*
 * singleton.h
 *
 *  Created on: 2011-12-24
 *      Author: bourneli
 */

#ifndef SINGLETON_H_
#define SINGLETON_H_

class singleton
{
private:
    singleton() {num = -1;}
    static singleton* pInstance;
public:
    static singleton&amp; instance()
    {
        if (NULL == pInstance)
        {
            pInstance = new singleton();
        }
        return *pInstance;
    }
public:
    int num;
};

singleton* singleton::pInstance = NULL;

#endif /* SINGLETON_H_ */
</code></pre>

<p>then, there is a plugin called hello.cpp as following:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include ""singleton.h""

extern ""C"" void hello() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""singleton.num in hello.so : "" &lt;&lt; singleton::instance().num &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    ++singleton::instance().num;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""singleton.num in hello.so after ++ : "" &lt;&lt; singleton::instance().num &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>you can see that the plugin call the singleton and change the attribute num in the singleton.</p>

<p>last, there is a main function use the singleton and the plugin as following:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;
#include ""singleton.h""

int main() {
    using std::cout;
    using std::cerr;
    using std::endl;

    singleton::instance().num = 100; // call singleton
    cout &lt;&lt; ""singleton.num in main : "" &lt;&lt; singleton::instance().num &lt;&lt; endl;// call singleton

    // open the library
    void* handle = dlopen(""./hello.so"", RTLD_LAZY);

    if (!handle) {
        cerr &lt;&lt; ""Cannot open library: "" &lt;&lt; dlerror() &lt;&lt; '\n';
        return 1;
    }

    // load the symbol
    typedef void (*hello_t)();

    // reset errors
    dlerror();
    hello_t hello = (hello_t) dlsym(handle, ""hello"");
    const char *dlsym_error = dlerror();
    if (dlsym_error) {
        cerr &lt;&lt; ""Cannot load symbol 'hello': "" &lt;&lt; dlerror() &lt;&lt; '\n';
        dlclose(handle);
        return 1;
    }

    hello(); // call plugin function hello

    cout &lt;&lt; ""singleton.num in main : "" &lt;&lt; singleton::instance().num &lt;&lt; endl;// call singleton
    dlclose(handle);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the makefile is following:</p>

<pre><code>example1: main.cpp hello.so
    $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS)  -o example1 main.cpp -ldl

hello.so: hello.cpp
    $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS)  -shared -o hello.so hello.cpp

clean:
    rm -f example1 hello.so

.PHONY: clean
</code></pre>

<p>so, what is the output?
I thought there is following:</p>

<pre><code>singleton.num in main : 100
singleton.num in hello.so : 100
singleton.num in hello.so after ++ : 101
singleton.num in main : 101
</code></pre>

<p>however, the actual output is following:</p>

<pre><code>singleton.num in main : 100
singleton.num in hello.so : -1
singleton.num in hello.so after ++ : 0
singleton.num in main : 100
</code></pre>

<p>It proves that there are two instances of the singleton class.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

"948959","1","970686","","2009-06-04 06:53:08","","2","367","<p>I am writing a API over the top of a COM object and you have to pass around the COM object into pretty much every type and static method that I write so that I can test each part of my API.</p>

<p>Now my question is do I have an overloaded method for the one that takes the COM object but pass the IoC resolved one instead to the other one instead, so that the users of the API don't have to worry about passing in the COM object or should I remove the overloaded method and just resolve it with out the option to pass it in.  </p>

<p>Bit hard to explain so here is an example;</p>

<p><strong>Constuctor Example;</strong></p>

<pre><code>FooType(IComObject obj,string table) {}
FooType(string table) : this(Ioc.Resolve&lt;IComObject&gt;(), table) {}
</code></pre>

<p>or just</p>

<pre><code>FooType(string table) : this(Ioc.Resolve&lt;IComObject&gt;(), table) {}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Static method example;</strong></p>

<pre><code>public static SomeType Create(IComObject obj,string table) 
{ // Do some work with obj}

public static SomeType Create(string table) 
{ 
   return MyClass.Create(Ioc.Resolve&lt;IComObject&gt;(),table);
}
</code></pre>

<p>or just</p>

<pre><code>public static SomeType Create(string table) 
{ 
   IComObject obj = Ioc.Resolve&lt;IComObject&gt;();
   return MyClass.Create(Ioc.Resolve&lt;IComObject&gt;(),table);
}
</code></pre>

<p>My biggest worry with the overloading is that it's going to create a lot of methods that just froward calls.  What other options do I have here or is this correct way of tackling this?</p>

<p>P.S I really don't want to burden the user with having to pass a instance of IComObject all around their application.</p>

<pre><code>self.labelOne.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@ %@"", self.valueOne, self.valueTwo];
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>valueOne</code> and <code>valueTwo</code> are of type <code>NSNumber</code> and <code>NSString</code>, respectively.</p>

<p>Further down, I scale add an image to the view with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>UIImageView *imgView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:newImage];
CGRect frame = imgView.frame;
imgView.contentMode = UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFit;

double aspectRatio = imgView.frame.size.height / imgView.frame.size.width;
frame.size.width = [UIScreen mainScreen].bounds.size.width - 10;
frame.size.height = frame.size.width * aspectRatio;
imgView.frame = frame;

[imgView setCenter:CGPointMake((([UIScreen mainScreen].bounds.size.width/2)+5), (([UIScreen mainScreen].bounds.size.height - (imgView.frame.size.height / 2)) - 5))];
</code></pre>

<p>Currently this works all fine and dandy, but if I try to add any other text to <code>labelOne</code>, such as the following:</p>

<pre><code>self.labelOne.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""Additional text %@ %@"", self.valueOne, self.valueTwo];
</code></pre>

<p>I get a runtime error, pointing to the line <code>imgView.frame = frame;</code>.  Commenting this line out removes the runtime error, but also prevents the image from being drawn in the view.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> It is interesting to note, though, that any modifications to the label's text <em>after</em> the variable references has no runtime error. e.g. </p>

<pre><code>self.labelOne.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@ %@ additional text after references"", self.valueOne, self.valueTwo];
</code></pre>

<p>What is happening?  The runtime error I get (when adding text <em>before</em> the variable references) is the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Error&gt;: CGContextSaveGState: invalid context 0x0. This is a serious error. 
This application, or a library it uses, is using an invalid context  and is 
thereby contributing to an overall degradation of system stability and reliability. 
This notice is a courtesy: please fix this problem. It will become a fatal error 
in an upcoming update.
</code></pre>

<p>Please let me know if there is any more code I can supply to help with this.</p>

<p><strong><em>SOLUTION</em></strong></p>

<p>This whole mess came as a result of deleting a UILabel in the storyboard builder and not removing the references to it in the code.  The IBOutlet property still existed in the .h file, and so no errors were called in the .m file, even though the field technically no longer existed.</p>

<p>Problem solved, entirely a creation of my own mistake.</p>

<p>The test always passes. In my testcase the NSSet is empty. When i insert a if-statement and ask for <code>if (mySet.count == 0)</code> it is true - so they are no elements in the NSSet.</p>

<p>Why is the assert not breaking?
Or: How do I check if a NSSet or NSArray is empty with XCTAssert?</p>

<p>For this what i did is I redirected the output of B's console to a socket on A and saved the output in a file on A. </p>

<p>I fire an ajax call that initiates the process(using web2py controller) to start at B. This ajax call also handles the redirection of B's  console to A's socket. </p>

<p>From the webpage I fire another ajax that reads the file in which the data  of the socket is being stored. </p>

<p>Now the problem I am facing is that when I fire the secodn ajax call it does not returns to the webpage untill the first ajax call is returned.</p>

<p>I want to know that is this the correct way of doing this. Also i want to know that, the problem I am facing is due to ajax or web2py framework?</p>

When I tried to create a new Universal App project I got an error that I don't have the newest .NETCore (v.5.0). So I reinstalled VS but it didn't help. Then I reinstalled Windows 10 SDK which also didn't help. Yes, it's the newest possible.</p>

<p>I tried installing .NETCore 5.0 with NuGet but I couldn't even open my project. So I went to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework.NETCore"" and renamed ""v.4.5.1"" folder to ""v.5.0"". I was able to run the Universal App project and target it with Nuget. I updated .NETCore through it (""Install-Package Microsoft.NETCore""). Code and designer works, but I can't build my project. I get an error:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt;C:\Program Files (x86)

</code></pre>

<p>I don't know what to do, I can't even google the thing - no results. Did anyone else faced this problem? What should I do?</p>

<p>I think it may be something with my .NETCore folder. If someone was kind enough to .zip me his ""v.5.0"" folder I could test if that works. What else can I do to address this issue?</p>

<p><strong>Double-check idiom</strong></p>

<pre><code>private volatile FieldType field;
FieldType getField() {
  FieldType result = field;
  if (result == null) {
    synchronized(this) {
      result == field;
      if (result == null)
        field = result = computeFieldValue();
    }

<p><strong>Single-check idiom</strong></p>

<pre><code>private volatile FieldType field;
FieldType getField() {
  FieldType result = field;
  if (result == null) {
    field = result = computeFieldValue();
  }
  return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the double-check idiom Joshua states, that the <strong>result</strong> variable is used to make sure that the volatile <strong>field</strong> is only read once, which improves performance. This I understand, however I don't see why we need it in the single-check idiom, since we only read <strong>field</strong> once anyway.</p>

<p>We desperately need to be able to properly index and tune the performance on these tables as our analyses are literally taking HOURS to complete - which of course become a problem on fields which are all set to some variation of <code>varchar/nvarchar (max/4000/8000)</code>.</p>

<p>Tonight I am working with our network/IT staff member to rebuild the MASTER DB on the server in question. I have written the following code to resize the columns after a final re-collation. PLEASE evaluate and give me some feedback in case I have overlooked anything and will end up giving myself headaches fixing mistakes (we will of course take full backups of everything first).</p>

<p>MAJOR EDIT:
The code above is a good start to solve my problem: HOWEVER - Determining the maximum data length from the sys.columns IS NOT 100% accurate. To prove this, run the first two cursors as shown then </p>

<p>SELECT * FROM #tmp_Table_Column_Types ORDER BY Column_Length</p>

<p>You will see some column lengths listed as 0 (and probably several that are less than 10 characters which you may be pretty suspicious of).</p>

<p>If you do a select query on the indicated table and order by the len(field) you will see that indeed there IS data in the supposed 0 length columns.</p>

<p>I haven't found an <em>elegant</em> solution to this yet, however I instead use a sub-query to conduct an actual survey of the column data and return the length.</p>

lastitem([OnlyOne], OnlyOne).

rowbelow([A,B|T], [X|Y]) :-X is B-A, rowbelow([B|T],Y). 
rowbelow([A,B|T], [X]) :-X is B-A.

 rowbelow([6,7,14,33],X).
produces the proper [1,7,19] (for the poly x^3+6)</p>

<p>The trace seems like my row below call in next item is wrong, and I think I'm missing a recursive call to keep moving to the row...</p>

<p>Hot to fix it?
Thank you</p>

"14311822","1","14314017","","2013-01-14 03:00:41","","0","347","<p>First, I apologize in an advance as this may be a bit of a vague question since as of now I don't have all too much to go off of.</p>

<p>I'm in the process of writing an ANE that takes an AS3 String and passes it off to a MFC C++ dll that inputs it to Windows using <code>SendInput</code></p>

<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646310%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646310%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a></p>

<p>Now I'm not yet too familiar with the Flash C API but I'm currently under the impression that Strings passed over from AS3 are typed as <code>const uint8_t</code> on the C side and populated using <code>FREGetObjectAsUTF8</code>. I'm using the following code to accomplish this: </p>

<pre><code>uint32_t len;
cost uint8_t str;
FREGetObjectAsUTF8(argv[0], &amp;len, &amp;str); //string is a single char
</code></pre>

<p>To send the keystroke I'm using this</p>

<pre><code>void KeyboardHelper::sendKeyStroke(int vk){
    INPUT input = {0};
    input.type = INPUT_KEYBOARD;
    input.ki.wScan = 0; //not scanning for hardware key
    input.ki.time = 0;
    input.ki.dwExtraInfo = 0;
    //virtual key code for the key we want to press
    input.ki.wVk = vk;
    input.ki.dwFlags = 0; //keypress
    SendInput(1, &amp;input, sizeof(input));
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>input.ki.wVk</code> is looking for the hex value of the keycode to be sent. MSDN has a list of all the hex values and associated keystrokes here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a></p>

<p>This code does work and I am able to input a keystroke from my AIR app its just not the correct key. Since you can convert <code>uint8_t</code> to <code>int</code> my current incorrect code is calling <code>sendKeyStroke</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>FREGetObjectAsUTF8(argv[0], &amp;len, &amp;str); //line from above
keyboardHelper-&gt;sendKeyStroke(int(str));
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this does seem to work, but I just get a random input.</p>

<p>I'm also not really even sure what the value of <code>str</code> or <code>int(str)</code> are since I haven't figured out how to step into this code when its being called from AIR. As a side-note, if anyone knows anything about debugging ANE's feel free to let me know :) (I'm using VS2012)</p>

<p><strong>I guess the root of this question comes down to this:</strong></p>

<p>Is it possible to convert a <code>const uint8_t</code> to a corresponding virtual key code? In this case I will only be dealing with one keystroke at a time.</p>

<p>If not it also seems like <code>KEYBDINPUT wScan</code> takes a unicode character if <code>dwFlags</code> is set to <code>KEYEVENTF_UNICODE</code>. Would it be possible to convert <code>const uint8_t</code> to a <code>WORD</code> type I could use in <code>wScan</code>?</p>

<p>I've been using the following MSDN docs as reference:</p>

<p>KEYBDINPUT: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646271%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646271%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a></p>

I have created my own classes that inherit from cv::Algorithm with success but I am having difficulty with this one since it has a member <code>m_model</code> which is a stuct from a library that can't be modified because the <code>MyAlgorithm</code> class is wrapping the functionality in this struct. </p>

<p>Anyways, I am trying to reference a member within the struct that is a `uchar[3] so I wrapped it in a cv::Ptr.
When I compile my program without and getters or setters on the addParam method</p>

<pre><code>obj.info()-&gt;addParam&lt;uchar[3]&gt;(obj, ""arrPtr"",  *arrPtr, false);
</code></pre>

<p>the code compiles fine but I get a runtime error when I try to <code>write</code> an MyAlgorithm object to file because it can't get the data. It is looking for a member variable with the <code>arr</code> name but it doesn't exist. So I defined some getter and setter methods for the <code>arr</code> parameter within the <code>m_model</code> class member.</p>

<p>However, I am not sure how to pass the member function pointers into the addParams method. I know that I can't just pass them into the addParams method like a function like I am currently doing in the code below. I have also tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>obj.info()-&gt;addParam&lt;uchar[3]&gt;(obj, ""arr"",  *arrPtr, false, &amp;MyAlgorithm::getArr, &amp;MyAlgorithm::setArr);

There we had a controller for controls (forms etc.) and then another controller just to deal with all HttpPost actions etc. Because of this is meant I could have a partial view called _ContactForm in both controller, one would set up the form view, the other would deal with the post back from the form.</p>

<p>I'm just wondering if there are any standard naming conventions now that I am using one controller. I have a partial view called _ContactForm which setups the view but Visual Studio informs me that I can't have a second _ContactForm to deal with the HttpPost even though I prefix the method with [HttpPost].</p>

<p>Is it best to have one method prefixed with an underscore and the other not, or is there some naming convention that is generally used?</p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>How I get the text short message sent by the user? It's a program named fetion from the mobile supplier in China. The client side fetion, just like a instant communication tool, can send/receive messages to/from other people who are using mobile to receive/send SMS.</p>

            JSONArray array2 = array.getJSONArray(1);

            String capitalCity = c2.getString(CAPITALCITY);

<p>So by this lines of codes I can get the country name and the capital city. </p>

<p>But <strong>in the same array</strong> there is another object called <strong>region</strong> which it has two other strings, <em>id</em> and <em>value</em> . How can I access inside <strong>region</strong> and get the <strong>value</strong>?</p>

To ease the pain of configuring the database mappings I've created myself a little helper class to serve as the base class for any custom mappings, but I'm unable to figure out how to make the last statement in the method work.</p>

<p>I am locating all public properties of type Enum and then calling the .Ignore method for every property found on the given type. The code uses Fasterflect for reflection and a little ForEach helper, but it should be fairly obvious what the code does.</p>

<p>How can I use the ""p"" (which is in fact a property on ""e"") to make this not just compile but also work? :o)  </p>

<p>Body can have different data inside. My problem is:</p>

<p>When content of the body more than user page I want to fix all <code>div</code> except body. Menu should be on the left side, Header should be on the top of the page and footer on the bottom and ONLY body should be scrollable.</p>

<p>Any help, please.</p>

<p>I have reworked the code to be more generic and to reduce the hardcore coding as possible (@Matthieu M.). But I would like to explain why I'm doing all this before.</p>

<p>I have, as many developer embraced the new c++0x standard in my code and I'm quit happy about it. But I have an issue with the strongly typed enums when trying to write test units.</p>

<p>The problem is that you cannot generate a random strong typed enum (I know, that you can, but wanted to do it in a more elegant way). So, now with this code, I can, using variadic templates and variadic macro (yes old dirty macro) declare and randomly select a strongly typed and scoped enum.</p>

<p>here is the code:</p>

<p><code>['create', 'delete', 'deleteList', 'fetch', 'fetchAll', 'patch', 'replaceList', 'update']</code></p>

<p>I am trying to create an angualrjs directive that takes that array and creates a list of checkboxes that uses these keywords in the array and uses true or false based on whether they are checked or not.</p>

<p>What I did so far is this:</p>

<p>Created the following html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span ng-repeat=""method in option.methods""&gt;
    &lt;permission-method method=""method""&gt;&lt;/permission-method&gt;

<p>and the following javascript:</p>

<pre><code>'use_strict';

var rcDirectives = angular.module('rcDirectives', []);

rcDirectives.directive('permissionMethod', function(){
    return {
        restrict: 'E', // element
        scope: {
            method: '='
        },
        templateUrl: '&lt;label&gt;{{method}} &lt;input type=""checkbox"" value=""{{method}}""&gt;&lt;label&gt;'
    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure how to continue from here...</p>

<p>EDIT1:
To clearify, let's assume I have that array of strings in a json I call <code>options</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>option = 
{ 
    name: ""some name"", 
    methods = ['fetch', 'fetchAll']
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when I use this directive, it will create the checkbox list using the <code>methods</code> array with only the <code>fetch</code> and <code>fetchAll</code> checked, and also allow me to change the <code>methods</code> by adding or removing items from the array.</p>

<p><strong>In general</strong> this should work for any array, given a premade list of strings.</p>

<p><strong>MY SOLUTION:</strong></p>

<p>So here's how I solved it:</p>

<p>I've created an object instead of array like as follows:</p>

<pre><code>{ create : false, 'delete' : false, deleteList : false, fetch : true, fetchAll : true, patch : false, replaceList : false, update : false }
</code></pre>

<p>And on the directive I used this:</p>

<pre><code>rcDirectives.directive('permissionData', function(){
    return {
        restrict: 'E', // element
        scope: {
            data: '='
        },
        templateUrl: 'permissionData.html',
    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>This is <code>permissionData.html</code> contenct:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;span ng-repeat=""(key, value) in data""&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;{{key}}
        &lt;input type=""checkbox"" ng-model=""data[key]""&gt; 
        &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Let's call them <code>.defaultMenu</code> and <code>.secondMenu</code>, the anchor is <code>.showSecondMenu</code> and to go back you've got to click <code>.hideSecondMenu</code>. Transitioning between them includes opacity animations. Usually I use <code>display: none</code> to ignore the click of 'hidden' menu's, but this time <code>display: none</code> isn't an option. </p>

<p>I already found found <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2091168/disable-a-link-using-css"">a topic</a> that uses <code>pointer-event: none</code>, but that doesn't work with IE9/10. Therefor I'm seeking for an easy way to transition between the two menu's who lie on top of each other, but only the active menus items are clickable.</p>

<p>The whole Idea is that, when the menu transitions from <code>.defaultMenu</code> to <code>.secondMenu</code> (and backwards) the active one fades out, while the new, hidden, one fades in. </p>

<p>As sort of stated, it should be IE9/10 compatible.</p>

            &lt;/ul&gt;

<p>and the same markup is used for the footer section and it's not working.
 I have also a file called jscript.js which contains all the javascript for the website, 
 and I found this variable:</p>

<pre><code> var navTarget = ""ul#nav li a"" //menu link to target 
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if I remove for example the markup in the header sections the footer will work.
I've tried also to use .nav instead of #nav and I have the same problem.</p>

<p>The navigation menu is controlled by javascript, I don't post the code here because it's huge, for better understanding of how the  navigation menu works look <a href=""http://demo.udfrance.com/SQUARED/index_white.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> </p>

<p>I've found this in the javascript: </p>

<p>//SET MENU ITEM IDs</p>

<pre><code> $(navTarget).each(function(i){
    i++                     
    this.id = this.id +""_"" +i ;
 });
</code></pre>

<p>//MENU CLICK FUNCTION</p>

<pre><code> $(navTarget).click(function() {

    //ensure link isnt clickable when active
    if ($(this).hasClass('active')) return false;

    //get id of clicked item
    activeNavItem = $(this).attr('id');

    //call the page switch function
    switchContent();



});
</code></pre>

<p>//CONTENT SWTICH FUNCTION</p>

<pre><code> var switchContent = function (){

        var PrevLink = $(navTarget+'.active')
        $(PrevLink).removeClass('active');

<p>I am using ZBar as an embeded reader. Basically hooking up a UIView in Interface Builder. Changing the class to <code>ZBarReaderView</code> and implementing the delegate method <code>-(void)readerView: (ZBarReaderView*) view didReadSymbols: (ZBarSymbolSet*) syms fromImage: (UIImage*) img</code>.</p>

<p>This works fine most of the time. There are however barcodes that apparently do not scan correctly. The first block gets interpreted wrong. I get something like <code>5008914...</code> the next time I get <code>7001814...</code> and then I get the correct <code>4001954...</code></p>

<p>I went back to the ""EmbedReader"" example from the SDK and looked to see if I could find any tweaks that might need to be made and discovered that it too produced the same error. If I look at the example ""ReaderSample"" the error does not occur, however this useses an instance of <code>ZBarReaderViewController</code>. </p>

<p>I then tried to change the <code>ZBAR_CFG_X_DENSITY</code> and <code>ZBAR_CFG_Y_DENSITY</code> both to 3 in my <code>viewWillAppear</code> method, but that had no influence.</p>

<p>What is the difference between the scan mechanism of <code>ZBarReaderViewController</code> and <code>ZBarReaderView</code>? What can I do to supress wrong results?</p>

<p>I have an iOS app that consist of a menu (table). From the menu the user is sent to a relevant local html files displayed in two webViews. I am interested in setting the title of the navigation bar to the name of the html file.  </p>

<h1>So far</h1>

<p>It works using  </p>

<pre><code>- (void) prepareForSegue: (UIStoryboardSegue *) segue sender: (id) sender
{    
   if ([segue.identifier isEqualToString:@""showWeb""]) {

//       NSString *myLabel = rowText ;
       ViewController *detailsTVC = [segue destinationViewController];
       detailsTVC.label = rowText; //rowText;
    }

    if ( [segue isKindOfClass: [SWRevealViewControllerSegue class]] ) {
        SWRevealViewControllerSegue *swSegue = (SWRevealViewControllerSegue*) segue;

        swSegue.performBlock = ^(SWRevealViewControllerSegue* rvc_segue,     UIViewController* svc, UIViewController* dvc) {

            UINavigationController* navController =     (UINavigationController*)self.revealViewController.frontViewController;
            [navController setViewControllers: @[dvc] animated: NO ];
            [self.revealViewController setFrontViewPosition: FrontViewPositionLeft animated: YES];
        };

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>This works perfectly when the user tabs an item in the menu.</p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>However, the problem is that I have links in the html files, which links to other local html files, and when the user press the links, of course, the title does not change. </p>

<p><strong>The basic question is, how do I capture/store a variable, which contains information on which html is displayed?</strong><br>
It must not be through the table because it will not capture redirection through links.</p>

<p>as <strong>rishavrastogi</strong> stated, *should be_success* expects a http code on the 2xx range, and a redirect falls into the 3xx range (actually its 302)</p>

<p>The assertion needs to be changed to => *response.should be_redirect*.</p>

<p>Although in this case, it's redundant to check that the response is a redirect and then checking that redirects to an specific page, so that assertion is not needed anymore.</p>

My implementation is based on the stanford tutorial. <a href=""http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/103/LinkedListBasics.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/103/LinkedListBasics.pdf</a></p>

<p>And the following is my code.</p>

<pre><code> struct node
 {
      int p_data;
      struct node*   p_next;

      node(node* head, int data)
      {
            p_next = head;
            p_data = data;
      }

      explicit node(int data)
      {
            p_next = nullptr;
            p_data = data;
      }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>And here is my insertion function</p>

<pre><code> node* insert_node(node* head, int data)
 {
      return new node(head, data);
 }
</code></pre>

<p>And what I want to do, I set up the list of 1, 2, 3 for initial and want to add more elements like 5, 6, 7. Following is my try but the insertion does not do anything. So I am only printing out 1, 2, 3. In the main function, I have...</p>

<pre><code>  struct node* head     = new node(NULL);
  struct node* nodep_01 = new node(NULL);
  struct node* nodep_02 = new node(NULL);

  head-&gt;p_data = 1;
  head-&gt;p_next = nodep_01;

  nodep_01-&gt;p_data = 2;
  nodep_01-&gt;p_next = nodep_02;

  nodep_02-&gt;p_data = 3;
  nodep_02-&gt;p_next = nullptr;
</code></pre>

<p>So if I print this, I get 1, 2, 3. And then I try to insertion one more element of value 5, but it does not do anything.</p>

<pre><code>  insert_node(head, 5);
</code></pre>

<p>Could anybody help me do this? I want to insert elements to this list... THanks in advance!</p>

<pre><code>/* show link destination after the A tag contents */
a:after {
    content: "" ("" attr(href) "")"";
}

<p>My plan is to add user-CSS to hide the useless image, and append a background to the <code>A</code> tag showing the company avatar for that user. There is nothing on the <code>A</code> tag properties that can help me. The only hint is at the A tag text node direct and last child.</p>

<p>is there any way to do that with CSS only?</p>

<p>since this is a user-style hack for a internal tool, the more bleeding edge tech the better. no need to support all browsers, care about perf, etc.</p>

I'm writing on an interface-website, where small and big images are loaded from another website.
I already implemented that a couple of years ago using a now outdated Firefox-version.
Back then I first tried an xmlhttprequest to load the image-data, and then using Javascript passed the image data to Firefox's internal filewriting-instances to write them locally on my harddisk.
As the xmlhttprequest didn't work for big images, I then used for loading the image data another Firefox-internal instance that was accessible by Javascript in this old Firefox-version. With current Firefox versions all this is not possible anymore with pure Javascript.</p>

<p>My questions now are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>What is the state of the art way with the latest Javascript de-facto standard to load image data into a Javascript variable (or image object)?  (Blobs? octets? Multipart? new image()? user-defined?)</strong><br>
As some of the images are so big I really want to implement a progress function in my interface. So that's necessary whatever way I take.
And I just don't want to reprogram the whole thing in a couple of months, so I'm looking for a recommended way to implement the download, in hope that these functions will be stable for a while.<br></li>
<li>Different from some years ago I now access with my Javascript via xmlhttprequest locally running PHP-files (apache &amp; php) to write to and read from my local harddisk. (My interface is loaded from ""<a href=""http://mylocaldomain.local/interface.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mylocaldomain.local/interface.html</a>"". This makes a couple of things easier anyway.)<br>
So my 2nd question is: <strong>Could I use a xmlhttprequest to a .php-script to download the images, <em>so that I somehow could access and show info of the progress (like ""1.432.234 Bytes loaded of 3.213.324 Bytes"") within my interface?</em></strong><br>
(Though I would clearly prefer to (down)load the data by a Javascript method along question 1.)</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>&lt;ajaxToolkit:ComboBox ID=""ddlAddAccount"" runat=""server"" AutoPostBack=""False"" DropDownStyle=""DropDownList"" AutoCompleteMode=""SuggestAppend"" CaseSensitive=""False"" CssClass=""ComboBoxStyle"" ItemInsertLocation=""Append""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the CSS to that:</p>

<pre><code>.ComboBoxStyle .ajax__combobox_itemlist 
{ 
            border: 1px solid YellowGreen;  
            font-size:medium;  
            font-family:Courier New;  
            padding-left: 0px;  
            list-style:none;
            list-style-type:none; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I'm facing is that when the DDL is rendered on the page, it is showing some weird boxes inside the dropdown. They seem to be bullets. But despite putting list-style-type : none; in the css, there is no change in the output. That is, the weird boxes still show up. Here is the screen clip of the rendered combo box:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/wGp4n.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I even checked the rendered HTML mark up to see if there is any character that is being appended but there isn't. The &lt;li&gt; tags in the &lt;ul&gt; tag simply has the list of elements that are binded.</p>

<p>Any Idea what this can be and how to get rid of these?? I tried <code>ddlAddAccount.Items.Clear();</code> before binding but that didn't help.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>Server is CF9 with latest hotfixes.</p>

<p>Fun bit, when chrome renders the final product the transparency is preserved, but when Acrobat Pro renders it it's opaque. I can print the final product to AdobePDF and it's accurately transparent, but I don't get a consistent page size to send through our print shop which is a showstopper issue.</p>

<p>But is the Built-in Like feature has a connection to the Like Button (Social Plugin)?</p>

<p>From my observation:</p>

<p>On web version, after I clicked the standard Like Button, the Open Graph Object can track that like instantly</p>

<p>Calling <code>fql?q=SELECT share_count, like_count, comment_count, total_count, click_count FROM link_stat WHERE url=""http://websitelinkhere.com"";</code></p>

<p>returns</p>

<p>But using the Built-in Like, the Open Graph Object cannot track that 'like' at all, the like_count and total_count are both 0.</p>

<p>And then here's the funny part:</p>

<p>By checking my <code>og.likes</code> using <code>https://graph.facebook.com/userid/og.likes?access_token=myAccessToken</code></p>

<p>It returns TWO likes, 1 from the Like Button and 1 from the Built-in Like Action</p>

<pre><code>{

<p>And then by using action <code>id</code> returned by <code>og.likes</code>, I can delete both likes using </p>

<p>Is it because I haven't submit my application to Facebook for reviewing yet?</p>

<p>I'm expecting the Built-in Like and Like Button work together as ONE action, but not generating <code>og.likes</code> independently.</p>

<p>The <code>myAttributeDirective</code> has it's own css page that defines some styling, like this:</p>

border: 1px solid red;
position: relative;

/* then some more class stylings related to the directive */

<p>So you see, in the css, it's defining some styles for JUST the attribute, so if the attribute exists in any element, apply those stylings.</p>

<p>When I view my element in Dev tools, it doesn't look quite right. In order to ""fix"" it, I un-check one of the css properties that is causing my issue, the <code>position: relative;</code>.</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>I can't change the ""core"" css for that directive, because it's used throughout the application. AND, if I try to override that property, it doesn't work (actually, cycling through the different position: * options only leads to making things look worse).</p>

<p>So, how do I override that specific property, without changing the core css file?</p>

I've just received a score of <code>163,930,640</code>, and it is displayed this way in one place. But in another place, on a text label, it is displayed as <code>163,930,6...</code>. I'm pretty sure all digits were displayed during active game play, but it switched to having an elipsis when it stopped being updated. Here is how I create the label:</p>

<pre><code>self.scoreLabel = [[UILabel alloc] init];
self.scoreLabel.hidden = YES;
self.scoreLabel.text = @""0"";
self.scoreLabel.frame = [self scoreFrame];
self.scoreLabel.textAlignment = NSTextAlignmentCenter;
self.scoreLabel.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];
self.scoreLabel.font = [UIFont fontWithName:@""Marker Felt"" size:36.0];
[self.scoreLabel setTextColor:[UIColor greenColor]];
[self.solutionBackgroundView addSubview:self.scoreLabel];
</code></pre>

<p>Could the problem be that the frame (set to 200 in the method not shown) is too small? I could change scoreFrame to initialize with a bigger frame, but I don't know what a maximum value would be, so I don't know what an appropriate size would be.</p>

<p>How would I size it appropriately to accommodate an unknown size? The score is updated 10 times a second, so I'm not sure using sizeToFit would be the right solution. I guess since I'm using textAlignmentCenter, and the label is centered where placed, I could just increase the size. On the other hand, I will be adding a feature to move the label to a space that is more restrictive. In any case, what I really want to know is what is triggering the elipsis.</p>

<p>The format I'm using is <code>NSNumberFormatterDecimalStyle</code>.</p>

But you can't use one of the implementation with nice-old extension method syntax. So this code won't compile</p>

</code></pre>

<p>but misses the point of extension syntax sugar a little bit. If you have lots of data transformation with LINQ and MoreLINQ calls - you don't want to use static method call in the middle. </p>

<p>The product development is done in Visual Studio at the moment using .Net technologies, so it's important to stay in the same set of tools. Roles apart from developers are using spreadsheets, docs and diagramming tools, photoshop to do their work.</p>

<p>Future:</p>

<p>We want to build a workflow (a sequential process with roles, queues for action items, passing on info from one role to the other, approval etc) for a product development. The software product will be in enhancement stage forever, more the reason to establish this flow. </p>

<p>Typical users are designers, business analysts, content creators, developers, code reviewers, testers.</p>

<p>Let's say a new webpage needs to be developed. It will be,</p>

<ol>
<li>thought about by the analyst in the
tool, will enter the information in
some format</li>
<li>a designer will use drag and drop to
build the page look, pass it over to
the</li>
<li>content creator, who will add
content(help text, hyperlinks, pure
text etc) to the page </li>
<li>a developer will check his queue to start
    building logic around this page and
    make it functional.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am thinking about Visual Studio Isolated shell to be used as a tool framework mainly due to it's IDE capabilities et al, to build this. Has anyone worked on a similar set of requirements? Any patterns/solutions/ideas around how to go about this in the VS Shell paradigm?</p>

<p>Update: Visual Studio Team System is already being used by the developers and testers, but there is no customized workflow for them (&amp; analysts, designers etc) available in TFS. Also Visual Studio is not the place for non-dev users that want to do things like, - define navigation flow, design the page elements etc.</p>

The cron job calls a <code>purgeData()</code> method that purges data from a postgres table. I manipulate java <code>Calendar</code> from the current date (via <code>GregorianCalendar.getInstance</code>) to determine the target date in which to delete data prior to.</p>

<p>My problem is that calendar manipulation and/or converting the newly manipulated calendar to a string for use in postgres fails occassionally, setting the target date to the current date which deletes everything prior to the current date, rather than data older than 1 (or #months to keep data) month old. </p>

<p>Here is my simple date format:</p>

<p>It appears that the date manipulation actually works, as shown in the output of start month and current month. In both failure cases, the integer values are different. However, the string conversion to SimpleDateFormat seems to be wrong. </p>

<p>I've read the javadocs in that when setting fields on Calendar, one must call get() for the time to be recalculated. However, add() is supposed to force recomputation.</p>

    String EXAMPLE_ONE = ""exampleOne"";
    String USER_ID     = ""userId"";

    public void setValue();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If any class implements this <code>SampleInterface</code> interface, what happens to the variables it declares?</p>

<ul>
<li>Does the inherited class get access to all the variables?</li>
<li>Does the implemented class needs to override the declarations?</li>
<li>What might be the purpose of declaring the String variables in an interface, when we could use an abstract class for this purpose?</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, what is the best strategy:</p>

<ol>
<li>A class with the final static fields and a private constructor?</li>
<li>An Interface with the variables as seen above?</li>
</ol>

"11249246","1","","","2012-06-28 16:43:43","","0","788","<p>I have to communicate with a controller that uses an unmanaged DLL in C#. The documentation isn't very helpful for the DLL and I have no experience with talking to DLL's. The company does provide a sample VB project with a class that wraps the DLL from VB. The class is called ctccom32v2.</p>

<p>I thought that since the dirty work of calling the unmanaged DLL is already done including structs and other variables, I could use that class to create a VB class library. I figure it will save me a lot of time and effort. So I added that class source file to a VB class library project and it spat out a dll when built. I then added that dll to my C# project references and I am able to see the functions in the reference browser. The library I created is named CTC_Lib.</p>

<p>(if your wondering why I just don't write my program in VB and use their class, I prefer and I am more comfortable working in C#)</p>

<p>The problem I am running into is this:
If I create an instance of the library using</p>

<pre><code>CTC_Lib.Ctccom32v2 ctc = new CTC_Lib.Ctccom32v2();
</code></pre>

<p>and then attempt to type ctc.somefunction, intellisense shows a few default methods like Equals, GetHashCode, etc. I do not see any of the Ctccom32v2 functions which expose the unmanaged DLL.</p>

<p>if I type the library and class name manually like so:</p>

<pre><code>CTC_Lib.Ctccom32v2.
</code></pre>

<p>The intellisense list pops up with all of the functions in Ctccom32v2.</p>

<p>If I add another class to the VB class library (Lets call it ""somelib"") and stick a simple function into it:</p>

<pre><code>Public Function add() as Void
Return 1+2;
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>I then use the same method for creating an instance:</p>

<pre><code>CTC_Lib.somelib ctc = new CTC_Lib.somelib();
</code></pre>

<p>the function ""add"" now pops up in the intellisense window by simply typing ctc.</p>

<p>Could it because the way the functions are declared in the VB class? Here is one of MANY  functions in the VB class, they are all declared the same using ""Declare Auto Function"":</p>

<pre><code>Declare Auto Function CtOpenConnection Lib ""Ctccom32v2.dll"" _
    (ByVal ConnectID As Integer, ByVal CommPort As Integer, ByVal Address As Integer) As Integer
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know what Auto function means but that does not expose the function when you attempt to create an instance of the class it resides in.</p>

<p>If this is or is not the proper way to call those functions within the VB class library please let me know, I am a novice. Also, forgive me if some of my terminology is incorrect; I am not good with programming jargon (yet).</p>

<p>C# Solution contains:</p>

<p>An ASP.NET Web Forms application which doesn't have a reference to the Neo4JClient, it's just a service front end.</p>

<p>A class library which uses the newest version of the client (dll says v1.1.0.0), this is the project the WebForms project uses for data.</p>

<p>A BasicAuthHTTPModule which uses the newer version of the client.</p>

<p>A Neo4jClient source library (no idea what version, and don't know how to check) which is used by the MembershipProvider project below.</p>

<p>A Neo4jMembershipProvider which uses the above Neo4jClient dll as a reference.</p>

<p>They were all using the older version until earlier today when I did a selective upgrade of BasicAuth, and the Class Library, now the solution builds as expected but when you launch it in the browser you get:</p>

<pre><code>Method not found: 'Void Neo4jClient.GraphClient..ctor(System.Uri)'. 

Source Error:

<p>Now, this is a serious error for me, we need to upgrade, but I can't find anything about this error. I am aware however that there were big changes to the client recently, so any pointers would be great.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>UPDATE: I updated the Neo4jMembershipProvider to the newer client version too, just so we are all running on the same code, but on build it comes back with this:</p>

The project was assigned with some code to scrape flickr that I know should work, but whenever I run the code it throws a TypeError. The function that is returning an error is:</p>

<pre><code>def getphotos(apicode, query, num_images):
''' Return a list of URLs that have a tag that 
    matches the query code. '''

# reach the target number of images

    photos.append(url)

return photos
</code></pre>

<p>The line that throws the error is  <code>flickr = flickrapi.FlickrAPI(apicode,  format='etree')</code> where apicode represents an apicode key given to me by flickr and I'm not quite sure what the <code>format ='etree'</code> does. When I go look at the flickrapi module and go into core.py, I get to the FlickrAPI class. The part of the class that seems to be of interest is given as:</p>

<pre><code>class FlickrAPI(object):
""""""Encapsulates Flickr functionality.

Example usage::

  flickr = flickrapi.FlickrAPI(api_key)
  photos = flickr.photos_search(user_id='73509078@N00', per_page='10')

</code></pre>

<p>When flickr gives me an apicode key, it also gives me a secret key which I have stored in a .txt file in the same directory as the program I'm working on.</p>

<p>Now obviously the call on the FlickrAPI class is being passed 3 arguments, 2 of which are the apicode key and the format ='etree', but I'm a little bit unsure as to what the third one is. Is the class somehow calling on the secret key through flickr, or is it one of the other inputs for <strong>init</strong>? How do I got about fixing the type error that the code is giving me?</p>

The first step has a radiobutton (yes and no) and based on the radio button input chosen by the user, i would need to hide or show a label in the second wizardstep.</p>

<p>Example: </p>

<p>Step 1: Choose 1 among the two options: Yes No (radStep1)</p>

<p>Step 2: if the radiobutton option in the previous step was yes.. then display a label(lblStep2) in this step.. Else hide the label.</p>

<p>I've been handling this through the jquery as i want the functionality in the aspx page itself...</p>

<p>The jquery code goes like this...</p>

<pre><code>$(""#&lt;%=radStep1.ClientID %&gt; input"").click(function() {
if($(""#&lt;%= radStep1.ClientID %&gt; input"").index(this) == 0)
{

{
    $(""#&lt;%=lblStep2.ClientID %&gt;"").hide();
}

<p>However, in both the cases, the label is getting displayed.. Could you please help me out if  there is anything that i'm missing?</p>

<p>I'm guessing that the label is getting hidden at first and then getting shown again once i click on the next button...</p>

<p>As you can see in my work, the answer column is of <code>DataGridViewColumn</code> type. I do not know the question type at that moment. Therefore I declare it as a normal column instead of <code>DataGridViewCheckBoxColumn</code>, <code>DataGridViewTextBoxColumn</code>, <code>DataGridViewButtonColumn</code>... </p>

<p>Now, it takes ~2s to execute and finished the original script, what I want it to do is display ""Analyzing &amp; Moving whatever...."" and then AFTER the script is finished, display ""Done."".
My issue is that both the message and the ""Done."" message appear at the same time.
I've added a small pause to it, about .25s, and the same thing, but it just adds .25s to the time it takes to display ""Analyzing &amp; Moving whatever... Done.""
Basically, why won't it show my first message, pause, then display the second? Because right now it displays the entire line at the same time. This may be because of my poor knowledge of pipes and whatnot..</p>

"30807042","1","","","2015-06-12 15:39:01","","0","102","<p>I have a rather curious problem. I have a multithreaded client server app built using Lazarus 1.4 and Indy 10 that I'm working on. It uses threads to send &amp; receive data streams from the server. Each module creates its own self-terminating worker thread for this purpose. However I also need to create a special message worker thread that receives messages from the server like when a database backup is in progress. This message thread is created by the application mainform &amp; remains active as long as the client application is active.</p>

<p>The server handles the sending of the data - message or database data - without problems. The issue is how to ensure that on the client side, server messages are read only by the message thread. All threads have Execute() procedures to process server communications.</p>

<p>My questions</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Will using a Thread ID for the message thread allow me to directly target the message thread when the server is passing a message.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, will limiting the messages to a certain size help in filtering messages meant for the client message thread (this is what I use actually but sometimes it fails).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Might I add that that all the client side threads use a common IdTCPClient to read server communications. I use critical sections to protect it.</p>

<p>The code for the message thread is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>procedure TMsgThread.Execute;
var
  LBuffer: TBytes;
  LMessage: TBytes;
  LDataSize: Integer;
  LMsgProtocol: TMsgProtocol;
begin
  //inherited;   // Gives abstract methods cannot be called directly
  // while the thread is not terminated and the client is connected
  while NOT Terminated and FTCPClient.Connected do
  begin
    Lock;
    //
    try
      if not FTCPClient.IOHandler.InputBufferIsEmpty and
        (FTCPClient.IOHandler.InputBuffer.Size &gt;= szMsgProtocol) and
        (FTCPClient.IOHandler.InputBuffer.Size &lt; szProtocol) then
      begin
        InitMsgProtocol(LMsgProtocol);
        // store the size of the InputBuffer in LDataSize
        LDataSize := FTCPClient.IOHandler.InputBuffer.Size;
        if LDataSize &gt;= szMsgProtocol then
          try
         // then read from InputBuffer the size of the protocol structure
            FTCPClient.IOHandler.ReadBytes(LBuffer, szMsgProtocol);
            // convert array of bytes to protocol
            LMsgProtocol := BytesToMsgProtocol(LBuffer);
            // check the command
            case LMsgProtocol.Command of
              cmdBackupDatabase:
                begin
                  //
                end; // cmdBackup: begin
              cmdPulse:
                begin
                  // Read the message sent by the server
                  FMessage := LMsgProtocol.Message;
                  // set the command to cmdKeepAlive
                  LMsgProtocol.Command := cmdKeepAlive;
                  // Convertir le protocol en bytes
                  LBuffer := MsgProtocolToBytes(LMsgProtocol);
                  // Envoyez la requÃªte en bytes au serveur

                end;
            end; // case LProtocol.Command of
          finally
            // clear buffer and message
            ClearBuffer(LBuffer);
            ClearBuffer(LMessage);
          end; // tryf

<p>The Execute methods for the other self-terminating threads are similar in structure to that shown above. I got it from a model on the Internet. szMsgProtocol is the size of the message protocol while szProtocol is the size of the data protocol. <strong>So essentially, in the Execute() above I am concerned with InputBuffer contents that have a size equal to or larger than the message protocol but strictly less than the data protocol. This is how I planned to sift the streams sent by the server.</strong></p>

"17748162","1","","","2013-07-19 14:06:53","","2","439","<p>Simple form of the question first:<br>
For serving large number of static content to a large number of clients, is it better to make an http server serve the content from the filesystem where each of the primary keys are stored in a file (Inodes!) or to implement a ""real"" database? With ""better"" I mean in terms of performance, machine load, memory usage and so on.</p>

<p>More detailed version of the question:<br>
We're currently doing a redesign of a database server that has the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>SSL</li>
<li>thousands of clients (1-30.000)</li>
<li>client requests are serialized, one at a time, about 100 entries within 2 min</li>
<li>clients will disconnect after timeout</li>
<li>some clients will later reconnect and do some more (1-10) requests</li>
<li>database will contain > 100.000 primary keys</li>
<li>database content is static (more or less)</li>
<li>request size is usually &lt; 80 bytes</li>
<li>response size is usually  &lt; 30 bytes</li>
</ul>

<p>Although our protocol is currently not http I thought about using Apache or another http server and altering our protocol to fit into http. But then the next question is whether to use a ""real"" database (e.g. couchdb) or if we just use the filesystem as database since > 95% of the requests will be request for static content. Performance and scaling is an issue here. If e.g. 1.000 clients will be powered on at exactly 08:00 AM, it might happen that these 1.000 machines connect simultaneously and do their 100 requests each. All within two minutes, all with the overhead of establishing a ssl connection. That could bring any server to its limits.</p>

<p>Any hints?</p>

<p>The code is too long to fit well in a stack overflow question, so here's the entire code in a pastebin.</p>

<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/h4V2DnXh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/h4V2DnXh</a></p>

<p>In short, the code connects to a websocket, receive and send data trough it, and, for me to follow what's happening, print everything it receives. Plus, several debug tools... well, in any case, it prints stuff. Or rather, it used too. For some hours, nothing has been printed.
A bug, would I think, the program doesn't reach any line where a print order is issued. But it does ! Everything works, data is correctly sent and received, the data is not empty, the bot does everything it's supposed to do.
Thus, I added a</p>

<pre><code>print ""test.""
</code></pre>

<p>at the beginning... and nothing happens... it isn't even about printing empty things, it doesn't print. At all.</p>

<p>By researching, i've found that print bugs could be linked to the usage of IDLE , but i'm using enthought canopy (python 2.7), or that it could be linked to imports, but the print ""test."" doesn't work, anyway.</p>

<p>Plus, it used to work, and I didn't modify the list of imported modules for a while. And anyway, the modules do not have errors.</p>

<p>The most suggested pattern it would be the one below and it is what I'm actually doing: creating and passing the new context throught business layer methods each time the service receives a call</p>

<pre><code> public BusinessObject GetQuery(){     
   using (MyObjectContext context = new MyObjectContext()){ 
      //..do something  }    }
</code></pre>

<p>For easy query I don't see any particular dealy and it works fine but for complex and heavy query it makes a 2 seconds query to keep going for like 15 seconds each call.</p>

<p>I could set the ObjectContext static and it would solve the performance issue but it appears to be not suggested by anyone, also because I won't be able to access the context at the same time from different thread and multiple calls raise an exception. I could make it thread-safe but mantain the same ObjectContext for long time makes it bigger and bigger (and slower) because the reference it imports each query it execute a query.</p>

<p>The architecture I have I think it is the most common so what is the best and known way to implement and use ObjectContext?</p>

<p>Thank you,
Marco</p>

<p>I need to build the dates in GregorianCalendar and have the date constructors in String. The date is shown Null in my output, any idea on a fix?</p>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>The date is null, the opening is 500, and the closing is 800

<p>The date is declared GregorianCalendar, however, The constructors are taking date in String, and should expect the form ""dd-MM-yyyy"".</p>

<p>Main Method:<br>
I have done parsing and formatting here, because months are of String representation in the given text file. First, I parsed months to Integer representation and then formatted from Date to String because Djia Class only take Date as String.</p>

<p>The conditions are so complicated that I cannot try to satisfy them 100% of the time (I would have to re-type all the conditions the function checks internally).
Instead, I should just retry calling with different arguments (as many times as necessary to fill my table).</p>

<p>In other languages I can write a catch block around the call.</p>

<p>However, in R tryCatch seems to work differently: you can give code with <code>finally=</code>, but after executing the finally-code the outer function terminates anyway.</p>

<p>Here is a minimal example:</p>

<pre><code>sometimesError &lt;- function() {
    if(runif(1)&lt;0.1) stop(""err"")

}
fct &lt;- function() {

        tryCatch( theSum &lt;- theSum + sometimesError() )

These clients have the ""display intranet sites in compatibility view"" checkbox ticked. Which is precisely what I'm trying to override.</p>

<p>The following is the documentation that I've used to try understand how IE decides to actually trigger the compatibility mode.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Site owners are <em>always</em> in control of their content.</b> Site owners can choose to use the X-UA-Compatible tag to be absolutely declarative about how theyâd like their site to display and to map Standards mode pages to IE7 Standards. <em>Use of the X-UA-Compatible tag overrides Compatibility View on the client.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google for <strong>""Defining Document Compatibility""</strong>, sadly the SPAM engine doesn't let me post more than 2 urls.</p>

<p>This is an <code>ASP .NET</code> web app and includes the following definitions on the master page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
   &lt;meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""IE=Edge"" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>web.config</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;system.webServer&gt;
  &lt;httpProtocol&gt;
    &lt;customHeaders&gt;
      &lt;clear /&gt;
      &lt;add name=""X-UA-Compatible"" value=""IE=Edge"" /&gt;
    &lt;/customHeaders&gt;
  &lt;/httpProtocol&gt;
&lt;/system.webServer&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've used Fiddler to check that the header is indeed being injected correctly.</p>

<p>My understanding is that with these settings I should be able override the ""Display intranet sites in Compatibility View"" browser setting. But depending on the client I've found that some of them will still trigger compatibility mode.
It also seems to be down to the machine level rather a policy group setting, since I obtain different results even when I use with the same set of credentials on different clients.</p>

<p>Disabling the Compatibility View Settings checkbox does the trick. But the actual purpose is to make sure that the app is rendered exactly the same way regardless of the client settings.</p>

<p>Any thoughts and what I could be possibly missing? Is it possible at all to force IE to always render the pages without triggering Compat mode? </p>

Currently I have 2 feature files.</p>

<p>In the second feature file, I am reusing a step from the first feature file.</p>

<p>Specflow automatically recognizes the step from the first feature file and when specflow generated the steps for my second feature, it was smart and did not regenerated the step I am reusing.</p>

<p>But this step is a Given step and it initializes a member field of the feature class.</p>

<p>Without using scenario context, how can I reuse a step from another feature file that initialize a member of the class ?</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>For example, if you have a Given I am logged in that is used in several feature file.
This ""Given"" creates a user object which is logged and store it as a member in .cs feature file.</p>

<p>When you use the same Given in another .feature, Specflow does not regenerate it in the correspond .cs file. When you debug the a scenario which is using it, it executes it from the first .cs file.</p>

<p>But I can't access the member of the first .cs feature file. I am planning to use a static member but perhaps there is another solution ?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""big-video-wrap-image"" style=""background:url(images/image1.jpg) repeat;""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How should I go about applying a fade out effect to the div class's background style so that the div remains but only the background image is gone (by fading out).</p>

<hr>

<p>Possibly unnecessary info:
To share what I'm wanting to do this for will bring up some additional issues but I'm hoping sharing these details will paint a complete picture of what I'm doing.</p>

<p>I'm using:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jquery 1.8.3</li>
<li>Modernizr 2.6.2</li>
<li>Cycle 2.9</li>
<li>Easing 1.3</li>
<li>prettyPhoto</li>
<li>BigVideo.js with all dependency libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://dfcb.github.com/BigVideo.js/"" rel=""nofollow"">BigVideo.js</a> displays a dynamically sized video in the background of a website (or theoretically any div).</p>

<p>But it doesn't work well with mobile devices.  So I'm using Modernizr to check for devices so the script to run BigVideo.js is setup like this:</p>

<pre><code>var BV = new $.BigVideo();
if (Modernizr.touch) {
} else {
    BV.init();
    BV.show($('.big-video-play').attr('data-video'),{altSource:$('.big-video-play').attr('data-video2')});
    $("".big-video-wrap-image"").attr('[style*=""background""]') /*No idea what should be on this line*/

}
</code></pre>

<p>the html as such:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""big-video-wrap big-video-play"" data-video=""vids/vid1.mp4"" data-video2=""""&gt;
&lt;div class=""big-video-wrap-image"" style=""background:url(images/ally1.jpg) repeat;""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and External CSS as such:</p>

<pre><code>.big-video-wrap {
position: relative;
height: 100%;
width: 100%;
overflow: hidden;
}
.big-video-wrap-image {
position: relative;
height: 100%;
width: 100%;
overflow: hidden;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is being used in a responsive website layout.
So that's how it's setup right now and both the bigvideo.js throws the video at the top of the master body div instead of the correct div class and of course making the firstframe/mobile image fade upon video loading isn't working either.</p>

<p>Help is greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

So, if <code>fl_base</code> and <code>fl_top</code> reside in <em>example.com</em> and the variable is pulled from <em>test.example.com</em>, then <code>fl_top</code>, while displaying the UI (menus, buttons, colors) will not allow the user to click on the link.

<p>We have a <code>crossdomain.xml</code> that allows cross-domain access between flash movies.</p>

<p>Can anyone enlighten me why this isn't working and if there is a solution, short of re-writing the flash movies (which has been decided is a no-go by the higher-ups)</p>

<p>I should also mention that I am using SWFObject 2.2 to load <code>fl_base</code> and that <code>fl_top</code> is called via <code>loadMovie</code> from <code>fl_base</code></p>

When you're in a loop, comparing object a to object b, do you have a preferred coding standard that makes sense (i.e., it is self-documenting) and can travel nicely to other code?  Or are variable names irrelevant in this type of code:</p>

<p>After a while of my updating of R from 2.11.1 to 2.12.0, I was now completely unable to pass scripts to R from Notepad++ (working together with nppToR).</p>

<p>when I installed nppToR, I always get the same dialogue of <code>""Could not find the Rgui.exe file. Aborting""</code>, and it will not ready for use. I thought it is caused by the updating of R.2.11.1 to R.2.12.0 because the Rgui.exe were located in different location. Then, for a while, the nppToR works after I edit the nppToR.ini file, from this:</p>

<pre><code>[install]
global=1
</code></pre>

<p>into this, which is also from the previous version of the nppToR files:</p>

<pre><code>[executables]

</code></pre>

<p>However, in these days, this modification never work for me, even though I uninstalled the R.2.12.0 and installed R.2.11.1. And I really have no idea the reason for that. Is there some one had the same experiences? Or, can some one help me out?</p>

<p>PS.: I also tried Tinn-R as an alternative, but after some time of use, the cursor usually appear in some position just like it is going mad, and when I input the code, each line can have only one single letter, and the cursor will move to the next line automatically.Do any body know why?</p>

<p>A copy of the table i am trying to implement into a chart is located here: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10fFAo_MxyLx1apRXiepR91UJXO2KA5ucRx2XB66bc4Q/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10fFAo_MxyLx1apRXiepR91UJXO2KA5ucRx2XB66bc4Q/edit?usp=sharing</a> it form 3 called ""Attendance Record"" which i want as a chart</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/W3Ese.png"" alt=""screenshot""></p>

<p>so i followed the steps of the first link from google and edited to make sure it links right and points to a selected range of cells but changed the #gid to #gid3 as i read that the number at the end represents what form you are referring to. Then i specified the range at the end of the link by adding &amp;rangeB2:C4 as i only want the name and number columns to be in the chart:</p>

<p>The link below is the one i edited and replaced .</p>

<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FOVmfesx7ATNe8qjWjkU2GbjBCBZxL0BRswJv6rcGPs/edit#gid=3&amp;rangeB1:C4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FOVmfesx7ATNe8qjWjkU2GbjBCBZxL0BRswJv6rcGPs/edit#gid=3&amp;rangeB1:C4</a> </p>

<p>but for some reason it bring up the error message as stated in my question.</p>

<p>Ultimately correct me if i am wrong but i think it is something to do with the URL link i am using because i tried it with another link that they used as an example and it worked. I even copy and pasted the same data they used into my spreadsheet and then copied the url and still it didnt work. </p>

<p>So how do you get the correct link?</p>

The background is that I have a problem where I need to find all solutions to a set of non-linear equations. The previous solution was to use <code>solve</code> in Matlab, which works for some of my simulations (i.e., some of the sets of input <code>T</code>) but not always. So instead I'm using MuPAD in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>function ut1 = testMupadSolver(T)
% # Input T should be a vector of 15 elements

mupadCommand = ['numeric::polysysroots({' eq1(T) ' = 0,' ...
    eq2(T) '= 0},[u, v])'];
allSolutions = evalin(symengine, mupadCommand);
ut1 = allSolutions;

end

function strEq = eq1(T)
sT = @(x) ['(' num2str(T(x)) ')'];

strEq = [ '-' sT(13) '*u^4 + (4*' sT(15) '-2*' sT(10) '-' sT(11) '*v)*u^3 + (3*' ...
    sT(13) '-3*' sT(6) '+v*(3*' sT(14) '-2*' sT(7) ')-' sT(8) '*v^2)*u^2 + (2*' ...
    sT(10) '-4*' sT(1) '+v*(2*' sT(11) '-3*' sT(2) ')+v^2*(2*' sT(12) ' - 2*' ...
    sT(3) ')-' sT(4) '*v^3)*u + v*(' sT(7) '+' sT(8) '*v+' sT(9) '*v^2)+' sT(6)];

end

function strEq = eq2(T)
sT = @(x) ['(' num2str(T(x)) ')'];
strEq = ['(' sT(14) '-' sT(13) '*v)*u^3 + u^2*' '(' sT(11) '+(2*' sT(12) '-2*' sT(10) ...
    ')*v-' sT(11) '*v^2) + u*(' sT(7) '+v*(2*' sT(8) '-3*' sT(6) ')+v^2*(3*' sT(9) ...

<p>I have two queries:</p>

<p>1) In order to use MuPAD I need to rewrite my two equations for the equation-system as strings, as you can see above. Is there a better way to do this, preferably without the string step?</p>

<p>2) And regarding the format output; when</p>

<pre><code>T = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1];
</code></pre>

<p>the output is:</p>

<pre><code>testMupadSolver(T)

</code></pre>

<p>Can MuPAD give the solutions as a set of vectors or similarly? In order to use the answer above I need to sort out the solutions from that string-set of solutions. Is there a clever way to do this? My solution so far is to find the signs I know will be present in the solution, such as <code>'([['</code> and pick the numbers following, which is really ugly, and if the solution for some reason looks a little bit different than the cases I've covered it doesn't work.</p>

<h1>EDIT</h1>

<p>When I'm using the solution suggested in the answer below by @horchler, I get the same solution as with my previous implementation. But for some cases (not all) it takes much longer time. Eg. for the T below the solution suggested below takes more than a minute whilst using evalin (my previous implementation) takes one second. </p>

<pre><code>T = [2.4336 1.4309 0.5471 0.0934 9.5838 -0.1013 -0.2573 2.4830 ...

end
function eq = eq1(T)
syms u v
eq = -T(13)*u^4 + (4*T(15) - 2*T(10) - T(11)*v)*u^3 + (3*T(13) - 3*T(6) ...
    + v*(3*T(14) -2*T(7)) - T(8)*v^2)*u^2 + (2*T(10) - 4*T(1) + v*(2*T(11) ...
    - 3*T(2)) + v^2*(2*T(12) - 2*T(3)) - T(4)*v^3)*u + v*(T(7) + T(8)*v ...
    + T(9)*v^2) + T(6);

<p>For instance, you have a few content types and user wants not only to view them, but to search using different filters, to add new items - all inside the same admin subsection.</p>

<p>In essense, this is classic search/grid/record screen/pages and while in typical Drupal distribution content management screents are kind of scattered around, I am talking about more organized spage, e.g. in which Grid (View) also has ""Add new"" link and you don't have to scroll to ""Create content"" menu which relates to a different section.</p>

Here's the model in question:</p>

    name = models.CharField(max_length=60)
    place = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    time_spent = models.BigIntegerField()

    workers = models.ManyToManyField(User, related_name='tasks_can_do')

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>User</code> model just holds a <code>name</code> field at the moment.
Here's my serializer for <code>ProjectNode</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class ProjectNodeSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = ProjectNode
        fields = ('id', 'name', 'place', 'time_spent', 'workers',)
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the API view (from <code>views.py</code>):</p>

<pre><code>class WebProjectNodeListView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = ProjectNode.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ProjectNodeSerializer

    def pre_save(self, obj):
        obj.parent_project = Project.objects.get(pk=self.request.DATA['parent_project'])
        for worker_pk in self.request.DATA['workers']:
            obj.workers.add(User.objects.get(pk=worker_pk))
        obj.final_worker = User.objects.get(pk=self.request.DATA['final_workers'])
</code></pre>

<p>I tried a simpler version yesterday at first, which only had the <code>Project</code> ForeignKey relationship, and it seemed to work, so I thought that using <code>add</code> would work too, but I get an error when testing out the API with <code>httpie</code> (I already added some users and projects, and am sure I get their id's correctly).
Here's the request:</p>

<pre><code>http POST :8000/api/tasks/ name=""newtask"" place=""home"" time_spent:=50 parent_project:=1 workers:=[1]
</code></pre>

<p>And I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>""&lt;ProjectNode: newtask&gt;"" needs to have a value for field ""projectnode"" before this many-to-many relationship can be used.
</code></pre>

<p>And the traceback also points to this line of code:</p>

<pre><code>obj.workers.add(User.objects.get(id=worker_pk))
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I get the feeling that this is because I'm trying to update the relationship on the <code>User</code> object before a <code>ProjectNode</code> object is created in the database, but I'm not sure how to resolve this?</p>

<pre><code>a:focus { outline: #FF0000 dotted medium; }

<pre><code>public class FooController
{
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        {
            // Code here
        }

        if (true == false)
        {
            // More code here
        }

        return View();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which looks nice and readable.</p>

<p>But in my team, the designers (who usually work only on Razor cshtml files) use a different formatting in their code. More or less like this:</p>

<pre><code>@using (Html.BeginForm()) {

    @if (true == false) {
        &lt;p&gt;You'll never see this!&lt;/p&gt;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>They generally open curly braces in the same line and have other formatting options because they only use cshtml (Razor) files. (They do other tricks as well so the source code looks similar to generated HTML code.)</p>

<p>We have all agreed on that and it's cool.</p>

<p>The problem starts when I or some other developer edits part of the Razor view and Visual Studio re-formats the code using our (C#/cs file) settings. This is not desirable.</p>

<p>The question is:</p>

<p>Is there a way to have different formatting options for .cs and .cshtml files, or to stop Visual Studio from formatting Razor cshtml files specifically?</p>

<p>Any help will be kindly appreciated.</p>

<p>However, I am a bit unsure about it's flexibility and customization.
What I really need is in-line editing, but at the same time I want complete control over this.
For example, we have developed a custom autocomplete (using jquery and javascript). And would like to use this custom-autocomplete in Kendo UI's Grid.
I do not know whether anyone has already used this approach as I cannot find this level of customization in Kendo UI.</p>

The related code of my wrapper is:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
      String[] cmdArray = {""java"",
        System.getProperty(""os.arch"").contains(""64"") ? ""-d64"" : """",
        ""-XX:+AggressiveHeap"",       
        ""-jar"",
        ""/lib/A.jar""  //replace with jar name 
            };
      Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmdArray);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The A.jar file is a referenced library (added in build path and class path) in my Wrapper project. Example:</p>

<pre><code> Wrap
   &gt;src
       &gt;org
           &gt;Wrapper.java
   &gt;lib
       &gt;A.jar
</code></pre>

<p>When I create the second jar file, from the Wrapper project (lets call it B.jar), its content is </p>

<pre><code>lib
   &gt;A.jar
org
   &gt;eclipse
          &gt;jdt
             &gt;... (i.e., all the files for the jarinjarloader)
   &gt;Wrapper.class
META-INF
       &gt;MANIFEST.MF
</code></pre>

<p>My manifest file from the second jar looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Manifest-Version: 1.0
Rsrc-Class-Path: lib/A.jar
Class-Path: .
Rsrc-Main-Class: org.eclipse.jdt.internal.jarinjarloader.JarRsrcLoader
Main-Class: org.Wrapper
</code></pre>

<p>When I launch the B.jar file, it shows me that the process started, but A.jar file is not called/launched. No error, no exception. The process starts and terminates. Tried to launch it via command line and double-click also.</p>

<p>If I modify the MANIFEST.MF file to </p>

<pre><code>Rsrc-Class-Path: A.jar
</code></pre>

<p>and the element from cmdArray in the main method of the Wrapper.java from</p>

<pre><code>""/lib/A.jar"" to ""A.jar""
</code></pre>

<p>and I make a copy of A.jar in the folder where my wrapper jar is present (e.g., B.jar), it launches perfectly, calling the second jar.
What am I doing wrong? How am I suppose to pass the class path to an inner jar file?
Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<li>edited etc/config.xml and changed the version number</li>
<li>System=>Configuration=>Advanced=>Advanced and disabled/enabled the module to check if it would reload it</li>

<p>just to clearify the cache management part:</p>

<ul>
<li>Configuration</li>
<li>Layouts</li>
<li>Blocks HTML output</li>

2)I use Firebug to watch what is the problem when runnig my page at local server(cause when opening page in browser through file system everything is ok). And there is error in Firebug:</p>

The original image size currently is 800px by 530px. If all of the clients browsers are bigger than the image size then I'd just load the image directly with the image tag and no styles, but that is not the case. Here is code I have so far that has mostly of what I want to achieve:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
@media (max-width:600px){IMG {width:600px;height:300px;}}
@media (max-width:300px){IMG {width:300px;height:150px;}}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;img src=""x.jpg"" width=""10"" height=""10""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So far, firefox and opera respect the stylesheet and displays the image nicely. IE7 displays it in low quality, but I only used it within wine emulator for linux.</p>

<p>While this seems to work, I feel I'm in a catch-22 situation because:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the image tag requires the width and height values to be specified inside it </p></li>
<li><p>The image defined by the image tag must be of the same width and height as the values defined in the image tag.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If I don't follow #2, then performance at the browser end will be slower because the browser has to scale the original sized image to fit in the image space defined by the image tag.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest what I can do to my code to make the images more responsive yet have high compatibility with as many web browsers as possible?</p>

<p>This URL routes to a method in my <code>ToolController</code>, which uses the slug to look up the tool in the database and return the appropriate views, js files, and information about the tool back to the browser.</p>

<p>Here's the part where I am looking for some advice:</p>

<p>Each of these tools can have some configuration settings associated to them, and these settings, along with the options for each setting, needs to be viewable on that tools page so the user can adjust the settings as needed.  The available settings are different for each tool.</p>

<p>So, for example, ToolA might have the following configuration options:</p>

<pre><code>Page Position -&gt; top, left, bottom
Header Color -&gt; blue, yellow, green
</code></pre>

<p>And ToolB might have the following settings:</p>

<pre><code>Font Weight -&gt; bold, regular
Page Position -&gt; top, left, bottom, right
Header Text -&gt; ""Heading 1"", ""Heading 2"", ""Heading 3""
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to determine the best way to set up models and tables to represent this information. Here's what I've come up with so far, but I would love to know if anyone has a better idea:</p>

<pre><code>ToolConfigOption
 - id
 - tool_id
 - name (this would be things like ""Page Position"", ""Header Text"", etc)

ToolConfigOptionValues
 - id
 - tool_config_option_id
 - value (this is the possible values for the option like ""top"", ""bold"", etc)

ToolConfig (this assigns the configuration to a specific user)
 - tool_id
 - user_id
 - tool_config_option_id
 - tool_config_option_value_id
</code></pre>

<p>Now, to list the configuration options for a given tool on that tool's page, I would lookup all the ToolConfigOptions and ToolConfigOptionValues for the given tool. To get the current settings for the tool for the given user, I would look up all the ToolConfig entries for the given user and the given tool.</p>

<p>I then had to allow a user input which is the ""Recommended maximum""(RM) and compare it with the total staff costs per unit. If the total staff cost per unit is less than or equal to RM then the details must be written to the screen and to an output text file called results.txt. If the amount is larger than RM then the results must be written to the screen only. 
Anyways here is my code below, and the bit im having problems with is the output mentioned above, Only shop unit 9 is printing to the output file and most of the time nothing prints to the console:</p>

<pre><code>        }

<p>I tried running as admin and in every compatibility properity windows has to offer. I right clicked on the <code>JetBrains.ReSharperUltimate.2015.1.3.exe</code> and confirmed the licensor. I also downloaded the SHA-256 checksum and tried to install it (which was stupid because it doesn't seem to be anything to install). I redownloaded the installer multiple time sand I also did a reinstall of Visual Studio itself.</p>

<p>When I tried running the silence installation it just did nothing. I didn't even got an error response.</p>

<p>I currently have Visual Studio 2015 installed. <em>(14.0.23107.0 D14REL)</em></p>

<p>I also contacted the JetBrains support but when I stated that I'm a student using the student discount they just silenced.</p>

<p>I love how ReSharper enhances Visual Studio but I somehow cannot get the installer working. Whenever I open it it's just a plain blank form. It showed it's visuals without problems on my Laptop.<br>
I suspect that the visuals are there but not visible (or completely white) because when I click at the upper right corner it closes as if the X was still there.<br>
I do not provide an screenshot because it's just a completely white square without header and everything.</p>

<p>I suspect that they are using some windows resources that I don't have installed for some reason. I've double checked Windows Update - I ahve everything installed.</p>

<p>But I keep getting an error 401 (Unauthorized) at the GetResponse stage.</p>

<p>When I compare the $_SERVER vars in my local host test page between the PHP and C# submissions, I get the same data apart from the sender port being a bit different. The crucial PHP_AUTH_USER and PHP_AUTH_PW are the same.</p>

<p>My OS is Windows 7 64 bit and I am using Visual C# 2010.</p>

<p>I guess the solution is really simple, but so far I am baffled. But a relative newbie to C#. I hope somebody can help.</p>

<p>Query is syntactically correct, but since $entity_id is undefined - query will always search for 'id = 0', which is semantically incorrect.</p>

<p>I would like such functions to fail automatically, when they try to use undefined variable. Is there such mechanism in PHP? Or maybe there is some tool, that can be used to analyze PHP source code to find such cases?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Those undefined variables can occur anywhere in project, so correct decision will be to check function arguments in every function.</p>

I created this application something like a flowchart to draw different types of plumb items with different endpoints attached to them. After it is being created as an element the endpoints are added dynamically according to the type of plumb item. is it like the following.</p>

<p>This is how I create the plumb items.</p>

<pre><code>    var element = document.createElement(""div"");
    element.setAttribute(""id"",schema_id);
    element.setAttribute(""class"",""item "" +control.Type);
    element.setAttribute(""style"",""left:"" +posX + ""px ; top: ""+posY+""px"");

    var output = document.getElementById('container');
    output.appendChild(element);
</code></pre>

<p>And then I add the endpoints according to its type.</p>

<pre><code>    jsPlumb.addEndpoint(element,&lt;the style goes here&gt;,{ anchor:&lt;the location of the endpoint goes here&gt;, uuid: &lt;a new ID is created for this&gt;});
</code></pre>

<p>And this is what it looks like</p>

<p><a href=""http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn39/tistus/2015-03-26_11-21-54_zpsknbhlycx.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">Screen One</a></p>

<p>I managed to grabbed the data from the method ""GetConnections"" and get it saved in the DB as a JSON. This JSON includes all the IDs which are for plumb items and all the endpoints.</p>

<p>But when I try to retrieve it back again to the UI, it appears like this. Everything appears great except the endpoints.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn39/tistus/2015-03-26_11-29-14_zpso6rpibqr.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">Screen Two</a></p>

<p>On redraw, the endpoints are created in the same way mentioned above. To reconnect the endpoints I am using this code.</p>

<pre><code>    jsPlumb.connect({ source:&lt;source id&gt;, target:&lt;target id&gt;,anchors:&lt;location of the endpoint&gt;,&lt;style&gt;);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The problem :</strong></p>

<p>For the above code, Although I give the UUID of the endpoint to the source and target, it doesn't identify it as endpoints to connect from and to.</p>

<p>Is there a way to find the ID and get them connected? What I found out was that only the plumb items could be searched with ""getElementById"" with the UUID but not the endpoints.</p>

<p>The problem is how to make these endpoints get connected as originally drawn. How can connect each endpoint back again? I have all the IDs and when they are redrawn they are having the same IDs as it had when it was saved. But I couldn't find a way to connect the endpoints back again separately since this has different types of endpoints specific to each plumb item.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Sorry for the long post
Thank you in advance!!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>to </p>

<pre><code>www.mysite/spoon/fork/5

<p>This has gone well, but I cant quite see how to ensure that a rewritten url will permanently contain certain parameters, even providing defaults, or a cookie value if not present in the actual query string.</p>

<p>I need to ensure that certain parameters are always visible in the url as they describe unique content, page will always be present without any modification of the application, but action, and language are optional.</p>

<pre><code>action = index if not present (handled internally by the application)
language = [session|cookie[language]] || 5 if not present -  i.e previous set value or default.
</code></pre>

<p>so although this is valid : </p>

<pre><code>www.mysite.com/index.php?page=spoon

<p>I need it to rewrite to this <code>www.mysite.com/spoon/index/cookie[language]</code></p>

<p>Where index is a default value applied to action only if action is not present.</p>

<p>and </p>

<p>cookie[language] is the value of that key from a cookie only if language is not present on the url, and if the cookie value also does not exist (first visit) it should be set to a default value of say 5 (I could redirect here carefully).</p>

<ul>
<li>12 digit password with at least 2 numbers, 2 letters, and two symbols</li>

<li>incorrect logins and blacklist trigger the same response</li>

<p>This is how the solution partially looks like.</p>

<p>Since I am using the Onion Architecture in a Winforms environment, hence I have the UI, Infrastructure and Core layers. All the layers are loosely coupled using Dependency Injection. What I want to achieve is that whenever a form from e.g. Accounts Forms (Class Library) is loaded, all the dependencies for that should be loaded in the UnityContainer i.e. types registered. These dependencies are interfaces and implementations present in Core and Infrastructure projects.</p>

<p>My confusion is that where should I write the code to register dependencies? What would be the Composition Root for this application? Please note that forms from e.g. Accounts Forms, HR Forms, etc are all loaded using reflection in the Main Windows application which references only the Base Forms Project.</p>

<p><strong>After Eben Roux's suggestions</strong></p>

<p>Here is how I am executing the wireup code when the assembly is loaded:</p>

<pre><code> Dim assemb As System.Reflection.Assembly    
              ...
              ... 
 If assemb IsNot Nothing Then
     Dim type As Type = GetType(IDependencyWiring)
     Dim modules As List(Of Type) = assemb.GetTypes().Where(Function(p) type.IsAssignableFrom(p) AndAlso p.IsClass).ToList()

     For Each [module] As Type In modules
         Dim argTypes As Type() = New Type() {}
         Dim cInfo As ConstructorInfo = [module].GetConstructor(argTypes)
         Dim dependencyWiringModule As IDependencyWiring = DirectCast(cInfo.Invoke(Nothing), IDependencyWiring)
         dependencyWiringModule.WireUp()
     Next
 End If
</code></pre>

<p>Here's is the Module having the WireUp method:</p>

<pre><code>Public Class AccountModule : Implements IDependencyWiring

    Private Shared Container As IUnityContainer

    Public Sub New()
        Container = New UnityContainer()
    End Sub

    Public Sub WireUp() Implements IDependencyWiring.WireUp
        Container.RegisterType(Of IInterface1, Class1)()
        Container.RegisterType(Of IInterface2, Class2)()
        Container.RegisterType(Of IInterface3, Class3)()
        Container.RegisterType(Of IInterface4, Class4)()
    End Sub

    Public Shared Function Resolve(typeToResolve As Type) As Object
        Return Container.Resolve(typeToResolve.GetType())()
    End Function
End Class
</code></pre>

<p>So my questions now are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it the right approach to store the Container as Shared and use it to resolve dependencies via Resolve method?</li>
<li>There is a problem in the way I am encapsulating the Resolve behavior of the Container. What would be the right syntax for that? I don't want to reference Unity on each of the form to be able to call the Resolve method, so I am encapsulating that i my own Resolve method. In this way I could easily replace the AccountModule with another one if I want to change the IOC Container without having the change the container references everywhere.</li>
</ol>

<p>The core functionality is to do an insert into a table in my database, but it has to be done in two different ways.</p>

<ol>
<li>Normal mode: whenever it's called only one time (outside of a loop)</li>
</ol>

<p>For example:
   <code>
//...
myfunc(param1, record); // it should insert a single record into the database
//...
</code></p>

<ol>
<li>Batch mode: whenever it's called from inside of a loop</li>
</ol>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>    while(...){ 

      myfunc(param1, record); 

    }
</code></pre>

<p>Inside the ""while"" loop, each time it's called, it only should store the record in a list and when it reaches the end of the loop, it should fetch all records from the list and prepare a ""batch"" query that inserts all in one go.</p>

<p>I am wondering how to make it to detect from where it's called in order to switch to the corresponding mode and also how to detect that it has reached the end of a loop and from now on, it should start getting records from the list, prepare the query and execute it.</p>

<p>Any tips or suggestions will be highly appreciated!</p>

<p>I have a files table and a users table, here's the schema:</p>

<pre><code>f_id, s_id, u_id, name, size, uploaded

u_id, username, password, email, activated, activation_code
</code></pre>

<p><code>u_id</code> is a foreign key. The <code>u_id</code> field in the files table points to the <code>u_id</code> in the users table.</p>

<p>Given the users username, I want to find the users <code>u_id</code>, and then check if they own the file through the file ID (<code>f_id</code>).</p>

<p>I wrote this SQL:</p>

<pre><code>$sql = 'SELECT u.username
        FROM `users` u
        JOIN `files` f
        ON u.u_id = f.u_id
        WHERE f_id = ? AND u.u_id = ?
        LIMIT 1';
</code></pre>

<p>I'm assuming that'd work if I was given the users <code>u_id</code> in the API request, but alas I'm given only their username.</p>

<p>How can I modify that SQL to find their user ID and use that?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Edit: Alright I've got this query but it's always returning an empty result set even though both the file ID and username exist.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT u.username
FROM `users` u
JOIN `files` f
ON u.u_id = f.u_id

<pre><code>$string = preg_replace(""/(\A|[^=\]'\""a-zA-Z0-9])((http|ftp|https|ftps|irc):\/\/[^&lt;&gt;\s()]+)/i"", ""\\1&lt;a href=\""\\2\""&gt;\\2&lt;/a&gt;"", $string);
</code></pre>

<p>It works perfectly fine, except when there's punctuation at the end of a URL (like when the URL is at the end of a sentence). It treats the punctuation like it's part of the URL, which obviously means the link won't work.</p>

<p>To fix this, I added a word boundary (\b) at the end of the expression. It works great - periods, commas, etc. no longer get added to the link! EXCEPT for the three characters <strong>&amp;</strong> <strong>'</strong> and <strong>""</strong>. Those not only get combined with the URL, but the replaced string adds a semicolon. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>[aaa].com.</li>
<li>[bbb].com,</li>
<li><p>[ccc].com?</p></li>
<li><p>[xxx].com&amp;</p></li>
<li>[yyy].com'</li>
<li>[zzz].com""</li>
</ul>

<p>become</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>[aaa].com</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>[bbb].com</strong>,</li>
<li><p><strong>[ccc].com</strong>?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[xxx].com&amp;</strong>;</p></li>
<li><strong>[yyy].com'</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>[zzz].com""</strong>;</li>
</ul>

<p>(The bold part represents what's now linkified - the semicolon is inserted as plain text.) Periods, commas, and other puctuation are successfully ignored. Ampersands and quote marks are included as part of the link, and a plain text semicolon gets inserted at the end even though it wasn't in the matched text.</p>

<p>I have searched and searched to figure out why, and I can't find anything that explains it. I've tested the expression on preg_replace tester sites, and it <em>doesn't</em> cause any problems there - in fact, it works exactly as it should, only matching the URL and not the end character. It's probably something simple that I don't know about regex or preg_replace, but I don't know how to successfully ignore all punctuation/special characters at the end of a URL, and not have some strange insertion of a semicolon after &amp;, ', or "".</p>

<p>In order to get some more information on why it might be failing, I've added a custom datetime converter, just reusing the basic IsoDateTimeConverter that comes with Json.Net, adn by placing a breakpoint on the converted value, I can see that the value converts fine, however when it gets to the model, the property is populated with a new datetime and not the value I am sending.  Sending the exact same model as XML works fine.</p>

<p>I'm a little confused as to the sequence of events and how it can go from being converted into a datetime object and then instantly lost by the time the model is bound.  I'm using the Json.Net IsoDateTimeConverter at both ends of the interaction for serialising and deserialising.</p>

<p>JSON Settings:</p>

<pre><code>NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Ignore,
DateFormatHandling = DateFormatHandling.IsoDateFormat,
DateTimeZoneHandling = DateTimeZoneHandling.Utc,
Converters = new JsonConverter[]
{
    new StringEnumConverter(),
    new IsoDateTimeConverter()
}

<pre><code>public class CustomDateTimeConverter : DateTimeConverterBase
{
    IsoDateTimeConverter isoConverter;

    public CustomDateTimeConverter()
    {
        isoConverter = new IsoDateTimeConverter();
    }

    public override void WriteJson(JsonWriter writer, object value, JsonSerializer serializer)

        isoConverter.WriteJson(writer, value, serializer);
    }

    public override object ReadJson(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, object existingValue, JsonSerializer serializer)
    {
        var returned = isoConverter.ReadJson(reader, objectType, existingValue, serializer);
        return returned;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Date property on the model (at both ends)</p>

<pre><code>public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>Json format being posted:</p>

<pre><code>""DateOfBirth"":""1980-02-01T00:00:00""
</code></pre>

<p>Value at converter:</p>

<pre><code>{01/02/1980 00:00:00}
</code></pre>

<p>Value at model in controller:</p>

<pre><code>{01/01/0001 00:00:00}
</code></pre>

<p>The returned variable when breakpointed is showing the correct deserialised datetime, however the model straight afterwards is a new datetime.</p>

<p>Rather confused as to how this can deserialise and the decide that it hasn't straight after!  Any help greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>On further investigation, it seems that the json binder is also failing to bind properties in general - a load of basic string properties are not binding correctly, so this might be a part of a different issue.</p>

<p>Hopefully you get the idea where some call is made in the state machine that will result later on in the event handler being fired and it sets up a timer to do a callback so that the event handler code can complete before we move on to the next state.</p>

<p>I am continuing a similar vein in C# but it feels wrong as I'm sure the language would provide a cuter way of doing this. Since my C# state machine is still calling VB6 objects that raise events on the UI thread, is there a better way of 'unhooking' the event handler so that it is released before the state machine continues on it's way?</p>

<p>I thought I could use BeginInvoke to add a message to the pump to run the state machine but on the same thread instead of a thread pool thread but my class isn't a form or control. I think I could come up with a solution that doesn't use timers but, well they are dead simple to use for this so any ideas would be great. </p>

<p>I would like to modify some of the default <code>php.ini</code> settings.</p>

<p>According to the documentation for the chef php cookbook I can modify the settings using</p>

<pre><code>node['php']['directives'] = {}
</code></pre>

<p>for example:</p>

<pre><code>node['php']['directives'] = { :short_open_tag =&gt; 'Off' }
</code></pre>

<p>I have made the modification in the <code>webserver.rb</code> script I have created in my applications cookbook.
When I provision or reload the vagrant box the <code>php.ini</code> settings remain unchanged.</p>

<p>Any ideas what is wrong?</p>

<p>The contents of the webserver.rb file are:</p>

<p>include_recipe ""nginx""</p>

<p>include_recipe ""php""</p>

<p>node.default[""php""][""directives""] = { :short_open_tag => 'Off' }</p>

<p>Even when i remove the dotdeb cookbook so that the only php stuff comes from the official opscode php cookbook it still doesnt update any ini values.</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL INFO</p>

<p>I have looked at the code in the opscode php cookbook that actually injects the directives into it erb php.ini template:
<a href=""https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/php/blob/master/templates/ubuntu/php.ini.erb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/php/blob/master/templates/ubuntu/php.ini.erb</a></p>

<p>The code that injects the appends the directives to the end of the file is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% @directives.sort_by { |key, val| key }.each do |directive, value| -%&gt;
&lt;%= ""#{directive}=\""#{value}\"""" %&gt;
&lt;% end -%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>this is always empty {}</p>

<p>However.... if i modify it to...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% node.default[:php][:directives].sort_by { |key, val| key }.each do |directive, value| -%&gt;
&lt;%= ""#{directive}=\""#{value}\"""" %&gt;
&lt;% end -%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then the directives ARE injected into the template. Im not a ruby expert. What is the fundamental difference between these 2 pieces of logic???</p>

<pre><code>function populateEvents() {

    $.ajax({

        url: ""populateEvents.php"",
        success: function(data, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest) {

            alert(""Status: "" + textStatus + "". Error thrown: "" + errorThrown);
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty simple, <code>populateEvents.php</code> does most of the work.</p>

<p>Now, when I want to add an event, I call the following function:</p>

<pre><code>function createEvent(u_id) {
    var title = $(""#titleInput"").val();
    var type = $(""#typeSelect"").val();
    var location = $(""#locationInput"").val();
    var date = $(""#inputDate"").val();
    var time = $(""#inputTime"").val();
    var allday = $('#allDaySelect:checked').val() !== undefined ? '1' : '0';
    var duedate = type == 'todo' ? date : '';
    var notes = $(""#inputNotes"").val();
    var output = 'u_id=' + u_id + '&amp;title=' + title + '&amp;type=' + type + '&amp;location=' + location + '&amp;date=' + date + '&amp;time=' + time + '&amp;allday=' + allday + '&amp;duedate=' + duedate + '&amp;notes=' + notes;

                toggleNewEvent();
                populateEvents();
            } else {
                // extract form problems from formProblems, in form: title=empty&amp;date=empty&amp;...

                var errorArray = data.split(""&amp;"");
                var fields = '';
                $.each(errorArray, function(index, value) {
                    var field;

                    field = smallArray[0];
                    fields = fields + field + ', ';
                });
                alert('You must fill in the following fields: ' + fields);
            }
        },
        error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {
            alert(""Status: "" + textStatus + "". Error thrown: "" + errorThrown);
        }
    });
}

<p>A bit more complicated, but I'm sure you get the gist. Values sent to <code>addEvent.php</code>, return string parsed, etc, events repopulated. Now, I just restructured the whole PHP side, to implement an <code>eventlist</code> class and an event class. Previously, the <code>addevent.php</code> file did all the actual backend work, but now, that file (after some validation) boils down to this:</p>

<pre><code>if ($return == '') {
        /*If return is empty, everything is fine, carry on.*/
        $eventlist-&gt;addEvent($u_id, $title, $type, $date, $time, $allday, $location, $dueby, $notes);
    } else {
        /*Throw an error*/
        echo ($return);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>As a result however, this file returns to the JavaScript function when it's sent that request to the <code>eventlist</code> object to execute the <code>addEvent</code> method. The function then tries to populate the event div immediately, and as a result, it doesn't work, because the <code>addEvent</code> method hasn't finished. When you refresh the page, however, it works fine, so I know it is inserting them correctly, it just needs to wait for that second PHP file to finish.</p>

</ul>

<p><em>The really nice part is this hasn't required any changes in the iphone code</em></p>

<p>I have an iphone application with a large dictionary held in sqlite format (read only). I'm looking for ideas to reduce the size of the DB file, which is currently very large.</p>

<p>Here is the number of entries and resulting size of the sqlite DB:</p>

<pre><code>franks-macbook:DictionaryMaker frank$ ls -lh dictionary.db
-rw-r--r--  1 frank  staff    59M  8 Oct 23:08 dictionary.db
franks-macbook:DictionaryMaker frank$ wc -l dictionary.txt
  453154 dictionary.txt
</code></pre>

<p>...an average of about 135 bytes per entry.</p>

<p>Here is my DB schema:</p>

<pre><code>create table words (word text primary key, sowpods boolean, twl boolean, signature text)
create index sowpods_idx on words(sowpods)
create index twl_idx on words(twl)
create index signature_idx on words(signature)
</code></pre>

<p>Here is some sample data:</p>

<pre><code>photoengrave|1|1|10002011000001210101010000
photoengraved|1|1|10012011000001210101010000
photoengraver|1|1|10002011000001210201010000
photoengravers|1|1|10002011000001210211010000
photoengraves|1|1|10002011000001210111010000
photoengraving|1|1|10001021100002210101010000
</code></pre>

<p>The last field represents the letter frequencies for anagram retrieval (each position is in the range 0..9). The two booleans represent sub dictionaries.</p>

<p>I need to do queries such as:</p>

<pre><code>select signature from words where word = 'foo'
select word from words where signature = '10001021100002210101010000' order by word asc
select word from words where word like 'foo' order by word asc
select word from words where word = 'foo' and (sowpods='1' or twl='1')
</code></pre>

<p>One idea I have is to encode the letter frequencies more efficiently, e.g. binary encode them as a blob (perhaps with RLE as there are many zeros?). Any ideas for how best to achieve this, or other ideas to reduce the size? I am building the DB in ruby, and reading it on the phone in objective C. </p>

<p>Also is there any way to get stats on the DB so I can see what is using the most space?</p>

<p>sub-project2 needs to have sub-project1 as a dependency.</p>

<p>I tried to put a <code>&lt;scope&gt;import&lt;/scope&gt;</code> in the dependency, but that didn't work either -- same result.</p>

<p>Its a character, a ""projectile"", moving trought a string. The string is updated and sent to the textArea inside the iteration, and the iteration stops when the character reaches a wall.</p>

<p>But my textArea only updates (visually) when i leave the iteration. While im inside it, textArea freezes, as if its waiting for the iteration, even with Thread.sleep() inside it.</p>

<p>I made an MVCE exemplifing the problem bellow, notice the text only shows after the iteration, i want it to apper in every step of the while.</p>

My Pebble Watch project has evolved and I'm now using an official external API to make HTTP requests to get values. My previous question was concerning JSON, now I'm getting the results in XML format.<br>
Here is the XML I get when I call the API : <br></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;root&gt;
   &lt;items&gt;
      &lt;item id=""1234567""&gt;
         &lt;author gender=""man"" country=""France"" region=""Ile-de-France""&gt;myuser&lt;/author&gt;
         &lt;category&gt;mycategory&lt;/category&gt;
         &lt;date&gt;2010-08-23T05:48:51+02:00&lt;/date&gt;
         &lt;from /&gt;
         &lt;text&gt;THIS IS THE CONTENT&lt;/text&gt;
         &lt;comments_flag&gt;1&lt;/comments_flag&gt;
         &lt;short_url&gt;http://myshort.url&lt;/short_url&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;/items&gt;
   &lt;comments /&gt;
   &lt;active_key&gt;1234567890&lt;/active_key&gt;
   &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;
   &lt;pubdate&gt;2014-07-12T18:51:49+02:00&lt;/pubdate&gt;
   &lt;language&gt;fr&lt;/language&gt;
   &lt;errors /&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this is what I have now in my SimplyJS script :<br></p>

<pre><code>simply.on('accelTap' || 'singleClick', function(e) {
      simply.body(""Loading..."");
      ajax({ url: 'http://myAPIurl', type:'xml' }, function(data){
      simply.scrollable(true);
      simply.body(data);
    });
  //}
});
</code></pre>

<p><br>
As a result, the full XML displays on my Pebble. But I would like to get <b>only</b> the content under the <b>&lt; text ></b> section.<br>
I've tried with some ""data.text"" selector, like in JSON, but I get objects errors.<br></p>

<p>Thank you !</p>

<p>So I'll try to expose clearly my problem.</p>

<p>I have a form (widget active form) in my main page. on this form the ajax validation works fine.
but, depending of certain option on this form, (for exemple check a radioButton), an additionnal part of the form appears.</p>

<pre><code>//start of the form
$form=$this-&gt;beginWidget('CActiveForm', array(
        'id'=&gt;'evenement-form',
        'enableAjaxValidation'=&gt;true,
        'clientOptions'=&gt;array('validateOnSubmit'=&gt;true)
                                )); ?&gt;

// some input
...
// my radioButton with my ajax event.
&lt;?php 
echo $form-&gt;radioButton($eventForm, 'comboGestionnaireValue', array(
        'value'=&gt;'2',
        'uncheckValue'=&gt;null,
        'onChange'=&gt;CHtml::ajax(array(
             'type'=&gt;'POST',
             'url'=&gt;@Yii::app()-&gt;createUrl('admin/UpdateAjaxFormGestionnaire'),
             'data' =&gt; array('form'=&gt;serialize($form)),
             'update'=&gt;'#gestionnaireCell')) )); ?&gt;

//the rest of my form.
...
</code></pre>

<p>So when I check the combobox, it will called the action in my controller.
this is the action : </p>

<pre><code>public function actionUpdateAjaxFormGestionnaire()
    { 
        $eventForm = new eventForm;
        $form = $_POST['form'];
        if(isset($_POST['ajax']) &amp;&amp; $_POST['ajax']==='evenement-form')
        {
                echo $form::validate($eventForm);
                Yii::app()-&gt;end();
        }

        $this-&gt;renderPartial('_ajaxContentFormGestionnaire', array(
                'form'=&gt;$form,
                ), false, true);        
    } 
</code></pre>

<p>And finnaly my partial view rendered : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$form = preg_replace('!s:(\d+):""(.*?)"";!e', ""'s:'.strlen('$2').':\""$2\"";'"", $form);
$form = unserialize($form);

$eventForm = new EventForm;
?&gt;
&lt;div class=""row""&gt;
        &lt;?php echo $form-&gt;labelEx($eventForm,""Nom""); ?&gt;
        &lt;?php echo $form-&gt;textField($eventForm,""Nom"",array('size'=&gt;50,'maxlength'=&gt;50)); ?&gt;
        &lt;?php echo $form-&gt;error($eventForm,'Nom'); ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=""row""&gt;
        &lt;?php echo $form-&gt;labelEx($eventForm,'Prenom'); ?&gt;
        &lt;?php echo $form-&gt;textField($eventForm,'Prenom',array('size'=&gt;50,'maxlength'=&gt;50)); ?&gt;
        &lt;?php echo $form-&gt;error($eventForm,'Prenom'); ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

...
</code></pre>

<p>and I want to have an ajax validation on this rendered part...</p>

<p>In other words : </p>

<p>I guess you understood that I have a form which is growing depending of certains options.</p>

<p>I want that these additionnal fields have a validation to see if they are correctly filled during the user is completing the form</p>

<p>for the first part of my form I don't have any problem. when I click on a required field without filled it and then I click somewhere else, this field becomes red and an error message appear under it. ( same if its a numeric field and some char are lost in it :))</p>

<p>but for the additionnal part (render partial part) I don't have any verification, when I click on a field and then I go away, any POST action (seen in firebug) is send... and then, any ajax verification is done... :(</p>

<p>all my rules are define in my eventForm model.. and I call the ajax validate in my action if there is a Post event...</p>

<p>I think that the problem is that : there are any post action send when I ""leave"" the field.</p>

<p>please do you have any suggestions? thanks in advance :) </p>

It's rather unfortunate that there's no warning in the documentation about this.</p>

<p>So what can I do? Is there any deterministic dictionary in the Python standard library that plays nicely with gc? I'd really hate to have to roll my own, especially over a stupid one line function like this.</p>

<p>Well, my question is that if it doesn't have '0D' and 'OA' ( used in Windows for carriage return and line feed ). How my java program is splitting the data into lines? It should not split it.</p>

<p>Anyone have any idea?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>A small JSF (No Spring, no EJB, no CDI) web application consists mainly on displaying datatables for entities, but the purpose is to display the list of an entity iems for a given Writer:</em></p></li>
<li><p>A datatable (<code>&lt;h:datatable/&gt;</code>) displays the list of Writers. </p></li>
<li>A datatable (<code>&lt;h:datatable/&gt;</code>) displays the list of Books written by Writers. (1--*)</li>
<li>A datatable (<code>&lt;h:datatable/&gt;</code>) displays the list of Evaluations given to Writers. (1--*)</li>
<li>A datatable (<code>&lt;h:datatable/&gt;</code>) displays the list of Topics treated by Writers. (1--*).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This is how I am seeing things:</strong></p>

<p>Since all the datatables have a column with the Writer ID (primary key of Writer).
How can I achieve telling the current user session to hold a parameter (Writer ID), when the user selects a given writer (preferably from the Writer datatable) and use it to display only the records related to that selected writer row.</p>

<p>The same way, when a user is done with the selected writer, he/she can reset the session to hold another writer ID and explore happily with the new selected writer child items.</p>

<p>In other words, using <code>&lt;h:datatables /&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;f:param /&gt;</code> (or something similar), how can I list Book, Evaluation and Topic items for a selected writer persistently. </p>

<p><em>E.G: Persistently for me means = When the user selects a writer from the datatable, and navigates to <code>/book/List.xhtml</code> page, the book datatable must list only the book items that the selected writer has. And if the user navigates to somewhere else, he can see only what's related to the same writer.</em></p>

<p>One idea is to use OpenFaces datatable filters, but it is too cruel for the end user to filter the table each time he/she navigates to a page. He has to do it only once. 
(An exciting solution is to add an <strong>OpenFaces</strong> filter (<code>&lt;o:inputTextFilter /&gt;</code>) for each datatable (<code>&lt;o:datatable &gt;</code> in that case) and then all the filters for all tables get automatically the writer ID held as parameter by the user session during the JSF cycle. But is that really feasible :( ?</p>

<p>Sorry for the redundancy. Hope someone could help with hints, ideas, solutions or better alternative.
regards.</p>

What is happening :-
The server side data gets deleted on clicking delete link.But the Datatable doesnt refresh after deleting a row on server.The usual ""processing"" message comes after deletion on server.It stays there.The UI row stays there highlighted with message ""Processing"" in the middle of the page

What i have observed is :-
1)The response of Ajax source after the delete url is called is this :-
{""sEcho"":1,""iTotalRecords"":1,""iTotalDisplayRecords"":1,""aaData"":[[""11"",""PD101-DH1234"",""adsasd""]],""sColumns"":""PartId,PartNumber,PartDescription""}
2)After using firebug,i observed no abnormalities.Both the delete and get source requests are executed perfectly with response OK.
3)I am using FireFox 4.1
4)I am using DataTables 1.8.1 build.

<p>Now Question :-</p>

<p>What do I change in the above code so that the datatable UI row gets deleted and datatable refreshes to bring the remaining rows ???
Please help me on this. I am new to datatables. This problem isn't going away. I have tried everything ! Waiting for replies :) </p>

<p>Here's what I've got at the moment: <a href=""http://pftest.comyr.com/grid/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pftest.comyr.com/grid/</a></p>

<p>One of the issues I encountered was figuring out how to get the grid columns (specifically, the 3 div columns containing the hexagon shapes) to collapse at the different screen-size ""breakpoints"" with CSS media queries so that they won't simply overlap each other at smaller screen sizes.</p>

<p>After a fair amount of trial and error mucking about I eventually discovered I could get it to to collapse to two columns for tablet screen-sized devices by applying a class/ID with width: 50% and float: left to a media query of: <strong>@media only screen and (max-width: 908px) { }</strong> and (hopefully) now it collapses neatly into two columns at roughly that size (at least it does from my brief testing)</p>

<p>The issue I'm having is now is figuring out how to get it get into collapse into a single column for the smaller smartphone screen-sizes (@media (max-width: 22em), @media (max-width: 320px) ect.</p>

<p>I have tried various different properties using the same #workgrid ID I used for the two column breakpoint - but for whatever reason just can't seem to get it work, and unfortunately there is little to no documentation included with the grid framework that might aid me.</p>

<p>The CSS in question is:</p>

<pre><code>@media (max-width: 22em) {
#workgrid {

    width: 100%;
    float: left;
    margin-left: 0px;
    margin-right: 0px;
    margin-top: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    padding-left: 5px;
    padding-right: 5px;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>which is applied to each of the DIV ""col-1-3"" classes. </p>

<p>As you can see at the moment it collapses into the two columns and then begins to overlap at any screen size smaller than that. I'm sure it is something relatively simple I'm missing/not seeing and just need a bit of a push in the right direction... :)</p>

This issue has happened just one-off. Now the page is showing OK to the same user.

<p>when i delete this, it doesn't leak , but when the line exist it make retain cycle and leak </p>

<p>what make leaks only to access <code>UITableView</code>? but others not????</p>

and <code>UITableView</code> is initiated from nib so i connect With <code>__weak</code> property</p>

I'd like to find at each location the median value of those images which do have data at that location, and also which image (i.e. which position in the first or Z-axis) contained this value. (Or in the case of an even number of data points at a location, the one immediately ""before"" the median).</p>

<p>This excerpt works, but is horrifically slow due to the <a href=""https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/4683"" rel=""nofollow"">poor performance</a> of median on masked arrays (it looks like there may be a fix in the latest numpy, but I can't easily move to that immediately):</p>

<pre><code>imageStackMasked = np.ma.masked_equal(
    imageStack, _NODATA_VALUE, copy=False)
medianValues = np.ma.median(imageStackMasked, axis=0)
whichImageUsed = np.ma.argmin(
    np.ma.abs(imageStackMasked - medianValues))
</code></pre>

<p>So I tried using bottleneck. This works, and is around 2000 times faster than the masked array approach:</p>

<pre><code>import bottleneck as bn
imageStack[imageStack == _NODATA_VALUE] = np.nan
medianValues_BN = bn.nanmedian(imageStack, axis=0)
</code></pre>

<p>However this part doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>whichImageUsed_BN = bn.nanargmin(
    np.abs(imageStack - medianValues_BN), axis=0)

-&gt; ValueError: All-NaN slice encountered
</code></pre>

<p>This is the <a href=""http://berkeleyanalytics.com/bottleneck/reference.html#bottleneck.nanargmin"" rel=""nofollow"">documented behaviour</a> of bottleneck; it fails if any image <em>never</em> has a value. </p>

<p>Why is this the case? I can't see any good reason why bottleneck should not output NaN at these locations, as it does for the nanmedian function. These functions are designed to cope with NaN data, so why bug out when we have NaN data?? In fact the bottleneck docs state:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For all-NaN slices ValueError is raised. Unlike NumPy, the results can be trusted if a slice contains <strong>only</strong> NaNs and Infs.</p>

<p>Which seems a bit of a contradictory thing to say: you can only ""trust"" that it will fail altogether! It's nice that I can trust it if a slice contains <strong>any</strong> NaNs, but it's no use if it contains <strong>only</strong> NaNs.</p>

<p>And more importantly, how can I work around this, to get the nanargmin to only run on the locations where at least one of the images has a value (i.e. where medianValues is not itself NaN)?</p>

I had everything working fine when I was just doing the hover effect when mousing over the image itself, but when trying to make it work when hovering over the ""profile"" div seems to have caused some problems. Currently, it will sometimes also be pixelated when not over the div, so it remains somewhere between the mouseover and mouseout states.</p>

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Javascript</h2>

<p>I'm using javascript to handle the pixelation stuff right now, but to be honest I'm a lot more familiar and comfortable with Jquery, so this has been a struggle and learning experience. Below is the whole code, but I'll explain what I changed that started my issues.</p>

<p>Originally, ""items"" in setup was taking <em>.profile-image</em> objects, and I changed that to <em>.profile</em> objects so I could use the "".profile"" div as the object with the mouseover event listener. At this point I introduced <em>""block""</em>, which i switched the event listeners to from <em>""element""</em>. </p>

<pre><code>def sort_questions
  params[:questions_attributes].to_a.each_with_index do |id, index|
    question = Question.find(id)
    question.position = index + 1
    question.save(:validate =&gt; false)
  end
  render :nothing =&gt; true
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the params that get passed by looking at my inspector in Chrome:</p>

<pre><code> ""questions_attributes""=&gt;{""1""=&gt;{""content""=&gt;""Where did you grow up?"", ""position""=&gt;"""", ""_destroy""=&gt;""false"", ""id""=&gt;""2""}, ""0""=&gt;{""content""=&gt;""What are you doing?"", ""position""=&gt;"""", ""_destroy""=&gt;""false"", ""id""=&gt;""3""}}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the the jquery sortable function that's being called:</p>

<pre><code>  $('#questions').sortable({
    items:'.fields',
    placeholdet: true,
    axis:'y',
    update: function() {
      $.post(""/templates/#{@template.id}/sort_questions?_method=post&amp;"" + $('.edit_template').serialize());
    }
  });
</code></pre>

<p>The position attribute is not saving. I've tried all kinds of variations of the sort_questions method over and over again with no luck.</p>

<p>Any help would be great. Thanks!</p>

<p>Here's the full params:</p>

<pre><code>""template""=&gt;{""name""=&gt;""Long Term Volunteer Opportunity"", ""description""=&gt;""This template will be for opportunities that are for long term missionaries."", ""default""=&gt;""1"", ""questions_attributes""=&gt;{""0""=&gt;{""content""=&gt;""What are you doing?"", ""position""=&gt;"""", ""_destroy""=&gt;""false"", ""id""=&gt;""3""}, ""1""=&gt;{""content""=&gt;""Where did you grow up?"", ""position""=&gt;"""", ""_destroy""=&gt;""false"", ""id""=&gt;""2""}}}

When I do a <code>cp -r /tmp/tmp.kk3a8xemvr/* /home/staging/myapp</code>, everything gets copied, but not .git folder.

<p>How come simple unix commands behave differently for the .git directory? There is nothing special about its permissions. Could it be that the period in front of the file causes some problems?</p>

This works fine, and I do think it is a good idea to clear the data between tests.</p>

<p>However, it can get slow and (as far as I can figure out) a bit tedious to generate multiple instances of the same object. There are some objects that are always the same in my database, or that I will always generate an identical copy of for testing. For example, my <code>Package</code> model, which defines the pricing and feature limits for a subscription package. It will probably never change.</p>

<p>Is there a way, with this configuration (please comment and specify if you require more info), to put certain instances of objects in the test database and <em>exclude</em> them from Database Cleaner, or any other way to keep permanent copies of specific objects in your test database?</p>

<p>This is mainly to increase testing speed.</p>

<h2>Original Question</h2>

<p>I am using the InAppBrowser plugin in my Cordova (3.4.0) app. </p>

<p>I'd like to have the InAppBrowser's location bar be editable when my app is being used on an iOS device (the Android version already has this).  On iOS it is just a read only line of text.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, by ""editable"" I mean, like any normal browser, the user can click on the address and change it to some new URL, and then have the browser load that new URL.</p>

<p>There is no documented InAppBrowser plugin setting for this. 
<a href=""https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/blob/master/doc/index.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/blob/master/doc/index.md</a></p>

<p>I think this needs to be a modification to the underlying Objective-C code for the iOS specific part of the plugin.  Unfortunately, I don't know Objective-C well enough to do it. </p>

<p>Any chance anyone has already done this or could do it without much effort?</p>

<p>Specifically, after an AJAX form submission, I want to display a little thank you message. Whilst it's all fairly simple in theory, SlabText does not process on the hidden content in its usual cool way. It process for all of my titles except the ones that were hidden when the page was loaded</p>

<p>Here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""result"" class=""container hide""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""row""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""span7""&gt;
            &lt;h2 class=""slab""&gt;
                &lt;span class=""slabtext""&gt;Thanks!&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=""span5""&gt;
            &lt;h2 class=""slab""&gt;
                &lt;span class=""slabtext""&gt;We'll be in touch&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=""slabtext""&gt;very soon&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using Twitter's Bootstrap &amp; the 'hide' class to set a parent div (#result) to be <code>display: none</code>. Once the form is submitted I set this div to be <code>display: block</code> (via JS) but no joy.
I've also tried to include a line to process slabText again within my JS function (i.e. after changing the display): <code>$('#result').slabText();</code> Alas this still doesn't work either.</p>

<p>I've created a JSFiddle to better show this issue: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/YeZfd/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/YeZfd/</a></p>

<p>I'm sure I'm being stupid &amp; missing something fundamental, if so please advise.</p>

<p>Thanks for any assistance!

<p>I have looked at swfaddress 2.4 and swfobject 2.2 to embed the swf and provide the deeplinking. So far everything works in Firefox and Chrome. However, in Internet Explorer 9, the back button and history functionalilty does not work, which is rather frustrating.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Flex sample file here <a href=""http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/samples/flex/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/samples/flex/</a> works pefectly in IE9. Upon futher inspection, it seems that they are using the ac_OETags.js file to embed their swf. Going through the documentation as well as the index.html file generated by flex, it seems that they are now using the latest version of swfobject as the preferred way to embed swf files.</p>

<p>Having said that, swfobject haven't been updated for more than a year. I am also unsure as to whether the author intends to update it. On the other hand, I do not like the way adobe's history.js works for deeplinking. Urls such as <a href=""http://site.com/#view=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://site.com/#view=1</a> looks very ugly in my opinion.</p>

<p>In light of the above, what libraries do you recommend for embedding swf files and deeplinking in a flex 4.5 project?</p>

<p>Here is an example of my class I want to copy:</p>

<pre><code>classdef MyClass &lt; handle
    properties
        data;
    end
    methods
        function M = MyClass()
           M.data=5; 
        end
    end      
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a test class to test changes:</p>

<pre><code>classdef Test &lt; handle  
    properties 
        store 
    end 
    methods 
         function N = Test(M) 
             N.store = M; 
         end 
    end 
end 
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we create an instance of MyClass and store it in Test:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; m=MyClass
m =
  MyClass handle
  Properties:
    data: 5
  Methods, Events, Superclasses

&gt;&gt; a=Test(m)
a = 
  Test handle
  Properties:
    store: [1x1 MyClass]
  Methods, Events, Superclasses

&gt;&gt; a.store
ans =
  MyClass handle
  Properties:
    data: 5
  Methods, Events, Superclasses
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, if I change the value of 'data' in 'm' I do NOT want it to change the value in store, however it seems like MyClass is stored in 'store' by reference:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; m.data=3;
&gt;&gt; a.store
ans = 
  MyClass handle
  Properties:
    data: 3
  Methods, Events, Superclasses

&gt;&gt; a.store.data
ans =

I'm happy that the actual manipulation of the AlarmManager is right; but I think it's something to do with the way I'm setting up to use intents.
Here's the relevant part of the manifest:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;uses-sdk
  android:minSdkVersion=""8""
  android:targetSdkVersion=""19"" /&gt;
  &lt;uses-permission android:name=""com.android.alarm.permission.SET_ALARM""/&gt;
&lt;application
  android:allowBackup=""true""
  android:icon=""@drawable/ic_launcher""
  android:label=""@string/app_name""
  android:theme=""@style/AppTheme"" &gt;
  &lt;receiver android:name="".MyAlarmReceiver""&gt;
    &lt;intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;action android:name=""android.intent.action.SET_ALARM"" /&gt;
    &lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.DEFAULT"" /&gt;
    &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
  &lt;/receiver&gt;
  &lt;activity
    android:name=""com.software.company.myapp.MainActivity""
    android:label=""@string/app_name"" &gt;
    &lt;intent-filter&gt;
      &lt;action android:name=""android.intent.action.MAIN"" /&gt;
      &lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"" /&gt;
      &lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.DEFAULT""/&gt;
    &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
  &lt;/activity&gt;    
&lt;/application&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I believe that the action and category are both correct; but I'm not sure that the permission is required.</p>

<p>Then I set up the variables I'll need, here:</p>

<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity {
...
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        intent=new Intent(this, MyAlarmReceiver.class);
        alarmIntent=PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, intent, 0);
        alarmService=(AlarmManager) getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);
        MyAlarmReceiver alarmReceiver=new MyAlarmReceiver();
....
</code></pre>

<p>where MyAlarmReceiver is, for the moment:</p>

<pre><code>// --------------------------------------------------------------------
public class MyAlarmReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver 
{ 
    public void MyAlarmReceiver(){}
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) 
    {
        Log.i(""Log"",""Alarm went off"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the actual alarm setting is this</p>

<pre><code>alarmService.set(AlarmManager.ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP,lowest,alarmIntent);
</code></pre>

<p>....</p>

<pre><code>}  // This marks the end of MainActivity
</code></pre>

<p>The code runs successfully, but never sees an alarm.</p>

<p>I have read some materials related to it but failed to find a complete answer yet. First, Odersky, et al.'s ""Programming in Scala"" says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/type-parameterization.html#19.7"">http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/type-parameterization.html#19.7</a></p>
  
  <p>It turns out that accesses to variables from the same object in which they are defined do not cause problems with variance. The intuitive explanation is that, in order to construct a case where variance would lead to type errors, you need to have a reference to a containing object that has a statically weaker type than the type the object was defined with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not sure about exactly what the authors mean by ""a <em>containing</em> object"" and ""a <em>statically</em> weaker type"". A code example would be more preferable here.</p>

<p>Second, ""senia"" gave a good example in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/10052539/234658"">Scala Modifiers and Type parametrization</a> that shows what problem class-private (<code>private</code>) fields may have with variance.
The example convinces me of why class-private members should be checked for their variance positions, but did not give an answer about the reason why we do not have to check object-private/protected definitions. I understand that such code as <code>getOtherCache()</code> cannot be written with object-private fields. But it does not give a proof of the innocuousness of object-private/projected definitions that we have not written a program that object-private/projected definitions cause problems with variance.</p>

<p>Third, Michid mentioned the topic briefly while decsribing how to implement function memoization in Scala:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://michid.wordpress.com/2009/02/23/function_mem/"">http://michid.wordpress.com/2009/02/23/function_mem/</a></p>
  
  <pre class=""lang-scala prettyprint-override""><code>class Memoize1[-T, +R](f: T =&gt; R) extends (T =&gt; R) {
  ...
  private[this] val vals = mutable.Map.empty[T, R]
  ...
}
</code></pre>
  
  <p>However since vals is accessed from its containing instance only, it cannot cause problems with variance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately it does not answer my question ""how (or why) is access control related to variance?"".</p>

<p>Can you explain in more detail the rationale of not checking object-private/protected definitions for their variance position (or provide some references)?</p>

<p>Any ideas on what could cause this?</p>

<p>Edit: Why does the application make use of jetty.websocket? The reason I am using cometD is, that I thought it does not use Websocket since WAS below Version 8.5 do not support those.</p>

<p>This works fine on 32-bit machines, both XP and Vista, but on 64-bit Vista (don't have x64 XP to test with) the redrawing just isn't working properly.</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas on where to start tracking this down?</p>

<p>Edit: This occurs on 2 separate machines, and at least the one I'm currently on has the latest drivers from NVidia.  </p>

<p>Edit2: Running a 32-bit XP virtual machine on my 64-bit machine and the application doesn't exhibit the redrawing issue in the VM</p>

<p>Edit3: It may be a driver issue, but we don't know if or when drivers will fix the issue.  A co-worker says there's fewer issues with an ATI card at home than with NVidia, but I've been updating my video drivers pretty much monthly for the past few months and it's still not resolved, so we can't just release our product and just tell our customers that some day the driver manufacturers may get around to fixing this.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any insight on what things to try to avoid?  We're compiling as x86 and all our components are x86.  I can't seem to reproduce this issue with any of the components in test projects, and I haven't heard anyone else report these issues on most of the the component forums, so it is fairly likely that it's something we're doing.</p>

<p>Given, that <code>rand()</code> generates a number from uniform distribution on <code>{0,1,...,RAND_MAX-1,RAND_MAX}</code> and numbers from subsequent calls can be treated as independent for all practical purposes except cryptography, this should return <code>true</code> with probability <code>p</code>: two <code>if</code> statements return <code>true</code> with probability slightly below <code>p</code>, and <code>false</code> with the probability slightly above <code>1-p</code>, while the recursive call deals with everything else.</p>

<p>However the following test fails:</p>

<pre><code>long long N = 10000000000; //1e10
double p = 10000.0 / N;
int counter = 0;

<p>This was easy for the ListBox as Selected is the same thing as Checked. Not true for the ListView.</p>

<p>So something like this except for CHECKED not SELECTED:</p>

<pre><code>Private Const LVM_FIRST As Long = &amp;H1000
Private Const LVM_GETITEMCOUNT As Long = (LVM_FIRST + 4)
Private Const LVM_GETSELECTEDCOUNT As Long = (LVM_FIRST + 50)
Private Const LV_SETSEL = &amp;H1000 + 43

Private Function ListViewSelectedCount(ByRef LV As ListView) As Long
    ListViewSelectedCount = SendMessage(LV.hwnd, LVM_GETSELECTEDCOUNT, 0, 0)
End Function

Private Sub ListViewSelectAll(ThisBox As ListView)
    Dim LV As LV_ITEM
    LV.mask = &amp;H8
    LV.State = True
    LV.stateMask = &amp;H2

    Call SendMessage(ThisBox.hwnd, LV_SETSEL, ByVal -1, LV)

All the samples of openNI and NITE run well, but I failed to build any of them in Qt creator. I really hope anyone can help me on this(Say how to build NiUserTracker in Qt creator). I will also apriciate it if anyone can give some sample Qt projects. </p>

<p>Since I don't have an Arduino, I grabbed a usb flash drive that I had laying around and started googling around for information about it.  I didn't find much helpful information in this area, so I'm now asking here: is it possible for me to access a USB drive's hardware (e.g. the LED) and interact with it via some programming environment (I was thinking C# should probably have some way to do this)?</p>

<p>Also, related to this subject - does anyone know what kind of commands USB drives use? For example, SCSI storage devices have a standardized command set; ATA devices have a similar protocol.  How are things like simple read/write commands issued to a USB storage device?</p>

<p>Let's consider an example:</p>

<pre><code>struct Shape {
    virtual double area() = 0;
};

struct Square: public Shape {
    virtual double area();
    /* ... */
};

struct Circle: public Shape {
    virtual double area();

};

double f(Shape &amp;s) { return 42.0 + s.area(); }
</code></pre>

<p>How C++ usually (always?) implements the polymorphism: <code>Shape</code> and every derived class has the hidden pointer to a virtual table as the first element. When <code>s.area()</code> is called, the pointer to the corresponding <code>area</code> function is taken from the virtual table of <code>s</code>.</p>

<p>But if I don't know about C++ and virtual tables and want to realize such polymorphism in C, I would do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>struct Shape {
    double (*area)(struct Shape *this);
};

struct Square {  /* is a Shape */
    double (*area)(struct Square *this);
    /* ... */
};

struct Circle {  /* is a Shape */
    double (*area)(struct Circle *this);
    /* ... */
};

double f(struct Shape *s) { return 42.0 + s-&gt;area(s); }

double cirlce_area(struct Circle *this);
double square_area(struct Square *this);

/* ... */

struct Circle c = { &amp;circle_area, ... };
printf(""%f"", f((struct Shape *)c));
</code></pre>

<p>When <code>s-&gt;area()</code> is called, the first pointer from the <code>s</code> structure used.</p>

<p>Why does C++ use virtual tables instead of just place pointers to virtual functions at the beginning of the structure (with the same order)? I can't currently find any reason why the last approach may not work.</p>

<p>I'm processing large amounts of XML data using PowerShell.
XML is stored in .txt files and my PowerShell script after reading the file writes the content into the database.</p>

<p>I would like to filter-out some XML nodes if they do not have proper ""signatureNumber"" (verifying it either by length, or preferably with regular expression).</p>

<p>Below is the XML structure:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Objs xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell/2004/04"" Version=""1.1.0.1""&gt;

      &lt;T&gt;System.Object&lt;/T&gt;
    &lt;/TN&gt;

    &lt;Props&gt;
      &lt;DT N=""declarationDate""&gt;2011-08-29T10:28:17&lt;/DT&gt;
      &lt;B N=""declarationDateSpecified""&gt;true&lt;/B&gt;
      &lt;Nil N=""testDate"" /&gt;
      &lt;B N=""testDateSpecified""&gt;true&lt;/B&gt;
      &lt;S N=""XMLdocument""&gt;&amp;lt;?xml S&gt;
      &lt;I32 N=""id""&gt;1359569&lt;/I32&gt;
      &lt;B N=""idSpecified""&gt;true&lt;/B&gt;

      &lt;S N=""signatureNumber""&gt;11111111111/222222/33&lt;/S&gt; &lt;----- signature length (21) is OK! We want the whole &lt;Obj&gt; 
    &lt;/Props&gt;
  &lt;/Obj&gt;
  &lt;Obj RefId=""1""&gt;
    &lt;TNRef RefId=""0"" /&gt;

      &lt;S N=""incidentSignature""&gt;Nc-e 491923/11&lt;/S&gt;
      &lt;S N=""signatureNumber""&gt;test&lt;/S&gt; &lt;----- wrong signature! &lt;Obj&gt; should be filtered out!
    &lt;/Props&gt;
  &lt;/Obj&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The content is read in loops using similar code:</p>

<pre><code>$filedata = Get-Content (""C:\EXPORT\MyData""+$pageNumber+"".txt"")
</code></pre>

<p>Right after reading each file, the XML is written into database:</p>

<pre><code>$Command.CommandText = ""INSERT INTO dbo.ImportXml (MethodName,XmlData) VALUES ('""+$methodName+""','""+ $filedata+ ""')""
$Command.ExecuteNonQuery() &gt;&gt; $log_message
</code></pre>

<p>The goal is to filter-out all <code>&lt;Obj&gt;</code> elements from the <code>$filedata</code> variable, if they contain ""signatureNumber"" with length different from 21. Everything must be done before the INSERT.</p>

<p>I would really appreciate any advice!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Just to clarify everything. In my example <code>&lt;Obj RefId=""0""&gt;</code> is OK and should be inserted, and <code>&lt;Obj RefId=""1""&gt;</code> should be completely removed from the XML.</p>

All is going smoothly except for one issue that I cannot figure out.  I have download links (buttons) on the site, and when clicked, should initiate a file download.  Here is the view that is executed when a button is pressed:</p>

<pre><code>@login_required
def download_file(request):
    '''
    downloads a file given a specified UUID
    '''

    if request.method == 'GET':
        file_uuid = request.GET['file_id']

        file_row = Files.objects.get(uuid=file_uuid)
        file_name = file_row.file_name

        response = HttpResponse()
        response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename=%s' % file_name
        response['X-Accel-Redirect'] = '/media/files/%s' % file_name
        return response

    else:
        return redirect('/files')
</code></pre>

<p>/media/files is served directly by nginx as a internal location:</p>

<pre><code>location /media/files/ {
   internal;
   alias /mnt/files/;
}
</code></pre>

<p>How this view is being called with an onclick event assigned to each button:</p>

<pre><code>$('.download_btn').on('click',function(){
    download_file(this.id);
})

function download_file(uuid){
    $('.file_id').val(uuid);
    $('.get_file').submit();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a form with a single hidden field.  This gets set to the id (uuid) of the button that is pressed.</p>

<p>Pretty simple right?  My issue is that when the download button is pressed, the download is not initiated correctly.  The user is not prompted with a save dialog, nor does the file begin automatically downloading (Chrome or Safari).  Instead, in debug tools, I can see the file downloading to what seems to be local storage in the browser, or some memory location (these are large files; > 1GB).  I see the memory ballooning, and eventually the browser will crash.  Any clue what I'm doing wrong here?  Based on what I've been reading, this should be working without issue.</p>

I'd like it to feel as if an edge of the cube is being dragged in the direction you slide, which brings me to my problem. I need the model to rotate independently of how it is already rotated.</p>

<p>For instance, if the cube is positioned so that the Y axis runs vertically, a swipe to the right should rotate the cube around the Y axis. However, if another axis, say the X axis, runs vertically in the cubes current position, then the same gesture should rotate the cube around the X axis.</p>

<p>Further complication comes when no axis is positioned directly perpendicularly to the direction of the gesture. Will some combination of rotations on multiple axes be required?</p>

<p>I'm stumped by the calculations required to accomplish this, but I'm sure it's possible, if perhaps through a completely alternative method I haven't thought of. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!</p>

Since there are a lot of cubes and they only the position differs, I thought I would use glDrawElementsInstanced. And it's working great, but I have an fps drop when the Engine is rendering the first cube (at the origin). 
I'm thinking it's drawing multiple cube on top of each other which could cause drawing the same triangles multiple times at the same position, and I tried to not render the first block by using <code>gl_InstanceID == 0</code> but it's drawing it anyway. </p>

<p>I have an interface <code>BoxCreator</code> which is defined by:</p>

<pre><code>public interface BoxCreator{
    public Box create(int id ,List&lt;Box&gt; others);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and a general <code>Box</code> class (A <code>Box</code> can contain several other <code>Box</code>es) which has methods like <code>int getId()</code> ,<code>Box getInternalBox(int id)</code>.</p>

<p>Suppose I have a class <code>Shed implements BoxCreator,Container</code> (where container is just a general interface with action like add and remove ). I can put new things inside the shed and it'll box them in a <code>ShedBox</code> which implements <code>Box</code>.</p>

<p>So far so good, the problem arises when I try to make some other class that will do things a little differently, for example <code>CoolShed extends Shed implements BoxCreator</code> which will put thing into <code>CoolBox</code>es (which extend <code>ShedBox</code>).</p>

<p>For now it works but I have several down-casts in the <code>CoolShed</code> class (from a general <code>Box</code> to <code>CoolBox</code>) that might be 'not pretty'.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is a way to make </p>

<p><code>Shed&lt;T extends ShedBox&gt; implements BoxCreator&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

<p>And then when implemeting the <code>CoolShed</code> I'd just do something like</p>

<p><code>CoolShed extends Shed&lt;CoolBox&gt; implemets BoxCreator&lt;CoolBox&gt;</code></p>

<p>I was trying to make the various classes generic but but couldn't create a generic <code>create</code> method because I can't instantiate a <code>T</code> or return one for that matter. So I'm a little lost.</p>

<p>Several notes: </p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>CoolShed</code> uses a lot of the <code>Shed</code> logic but I'd just to make it use the <code>CoolBox</code> class as a container.</li>
<li>Currently the <code>Shed</code> has an instance of a <code>BoxCreator</code> so when creating <code>CoolShed</code> I just make <code>CoolShed</code> the new creator and it works.</li>
<li><code>CoolShed</code> will only have <code>CoolBox</code> instances but I wouldn't really mind anything extending <code>ShedBox</code> in the <code>Shed</code> class.</li>
</ol>

<p>I just couldn't find a good explanation of how to achieve the desired behavior nor I could tell whether my existing casts are O.K.</p>

<p>I know my example is quite long I'd be happy to make it clearer in any way I can. </p>

<p>I'm synchronizing it at each display loop.</p>

<p>Method:</p>

<p>1) Retrieve the MKMapView.visibleMapRect</p>

<p>2) Set the glViewPort</p>

<p>3) Do an orthographic projection to adjust my layer to the MapView.</p>

<p>I already tried others methods, like moving the cocos2D layer with touch and then move the coordinates of my map according to the touch, still laggy.</p>

<p>Even disabling acceleration and deceleration of the MapView doesn't remove the lag.</p>

<p>What is the right MVVM way to do this?  I thought of two ways :    </p>

<p>1) I was thinking exposing ModeChanged property on the user control and propagating it to the view, and then add the Save button. (But does that goes against MVVM way i.e. having code in code behind?).</p>

<p>2) Handling propertychanged of the dependancy property itself, and adding the save button, from the user control. (doesn't seem right as application logic gets mixed in usercontrol)</p>

This is only needed to expedite testing to make it easier to spawn multiple instances as apposed to compiling manually via javac and launching with a script using java class.name ... each time.

This works perfect in normal cases (which in my opinion means that there is no alias in the query string ""AS bla_bla""). Lets say that someone writes a query string that contains an alias, which contains the name of a column the script should decrypt, the query dies, because my regex wraps not only the column, but the alias as well. That is not how its supposed to be.</p>

<p>This is the regex I've written:</p>

<pre><code>preg_replace(""/(((\`|)\w+(\`|)\.|)[encrypted|column|list])/i"", ""AES_DECRYPT(${0},'the hash')""
</code></pre>

<p>The part with the grave accents is there because sometimes the query does contain the table name which is either inside of grave accents or not.</p>

<p>An example input:  </p>

<pre><code>SELECT encrypted, something AS 'a_column' FROM a_table;
</code></pre>

<p>An example output:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT AES_DECRYPT(encrypted, 'the hash'), something AS 'a_AES_DECRYPT(column, 'the hash')' FROM a_table;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, this is not going to work, so my idea was to search only for words, that are not right after the word 'as' until a special character or a white space appears. Of course i tried it hours to work, but I don't get the correct syntax.</p>

<p>Is it possible to solve this with pure regex and if yes how would it look like?</p>

For deserialization of JSON data to my data transfer objects, a DAO has to be contacted to check if an appropriate object exists, otherwise a <code>DeserializationException</code> should be thrown.</p>

<p>So far, I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>object MyJsonProtocol extends DefaultJsonProtocol {

  implicit object MyDtoJsonFormat extends RootJsonFormat[MyDto] {

    override def write(obj: MyDto): JsValue = // Serialization implementation

    override def read(json: JsValue): MyDto = {
      // parse the JSON, get some parameters, let them be a, b, c
      dtoLookup(a, b, c) match {
        case Some(dto: MyDto) =&gt; dto
        case None =&gt; throw new DeserializationException(""Cannot retrieve object from DAO"")
      }
    }
  }

  def dtoLookup(a: SomeType, b: SomeOtherType, c: YetAnotherType)(implicit dao: MyDAO): Option[MyDto] = {
    // lookup the MyDTO with the dao instance
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My test looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>class MyJsonProtocolTest extends FlatSpec with Matchers {

  implicit val MyDAO = // some test instance, can be a mock object

  ""The protocol"" should ""serialize a DTO"" in {
    val dto: MyDTO = ...
    dto.toJson.compactPrint should be(""{...}"")
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, the compiler complains that it cannot find the implicit <code>MyDAO</code> when trying to compile the <code>MyJSONProtocol</code>. In <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29827761/when-testing-spray-services-with-scalatest-how-to-introduce-implicit-values"">When testing Spray services with Scalatest, how to introduce implicit values?</a> I asked yesterday, I was suggested to pass in the implicit parameter directly into the method, but I cannot do this here because the <code>read</code> method is defined in the <code>RootJsonFormat</code>.</p>

<p>When I call the <code>dtoLookup</code> method directly from my test code, it succeeds.</p>

<p>So, how do I get the <code>MyDAO</code> instance into my special JSON format?</p>

<hr>

<p>Can you please explain, are these true or false?</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> - In MySQL there is no way to undo update or delete queries that have already taken place. For example there have been 1900 queries within past 24 hours. None can be undone.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> - It is ONLY possible to rollback the current transaction in MySQL.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> - Savepoints are destroyed after the transaction is over. In other words it is not possible to create save points for 10 am today.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> - Savepoints and rollback are only effective within the current transaction and after the commit has been done they die.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1</strong> - What is the point of rollback or transaction if it is ONLY possible to rollback the current transaction?</p>

<p>If the transaction is wrong why run it?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I created a savepoint like this:</p>

<pre><code>start transaction;
savepoint behnam;
commit;
</code></pre>

<p>Then ran a few update and delete queries. Then tried to rollback to that savepoint:</p>

<pre><code>rollback to savepoint behnam

I have figured out, that I might create a Word Template project in visual studio 2010, and program the template, so that when you enter a single value (id-number), it automatically fills out the entire document.</p>

<p>I am quite confident that this is possible. the only problem is. How do I loop through all entries in the database, open a new document based on the template and set the id-value?</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; idnumbers.Count(); i++)
{
     Word.Application app = new Word.Application();
     Word.Document doc = app.Documents.Add(@""C:\..\WordGenerator\bin\Debug\WordTemplate.dotx"");
     //input the id-number below: HOW??

     doc.SaveAs(FileName: @""c:\temp\test.docx""); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The application is supposed to run only once, generating the reports, and it doesnÂ´t have to be fast. It just has to be easy to develop.</p>

<p>The problem here is, that it seems that the DocumentBase object is not accessible outside the Word project. The substitute Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Document does not have functionality like SelectContentControlsByTitle that allows me to find and set my ContentControls. And that is exactly what I need to do..</p>

<p>This is what my code looks like now to insert the text into my field:
              Word.Application app = new Word.Application();</p>

<pre><code>        Word.Document doc = app.Documents.Add(@""C:\..\test.dotx"");

        foreach (Word.ContentControl cc in doc.SelectContentControlsByTitle(""MyCCTitle""))
        {
            cc.Range.Text += ""1234"";
        }

        doc.SaveAs(FileName: @""c:\temp\test.docx"");

"18482296","1","18482619","","2013-08-28 07:57:57","","3","106","<p>I'm in a situation where I have a <code>Bag</code> that has a <code>AddSlot</code> method inside.
I have two types of bags, <code>ItemsBag</code> and <code>DCBag</code> (stands for draggable content)
<code>ItemsBag</code> is a 2D bag meaning it has rows and columns, <code>DCBag</code> is 1D, it has only one column but many rows (Which means I can consider it 2D as well).</p>

<p>Now the thing is, since the first bag deals with 2D indices, I would want <code>AddSlot</code> signature to be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void AddSlot(int r, int c);
</code></pre>

<p>And the other bag's <code>AddSlot</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public void AddSlot(int r);
</code></pre>

<p>How can I write a virtual/abstract signature of <code>AddSlot</code> in <code>Bag</code> such that when <code>ItemsBag</code> and <code>DCBag</code> inherit from <code>Bag</code> they can override the signature in the way I mentioned above?</p>

<p>As I said, I can consider the <code>DCBag</code> to be 2D as well, so that both it and <code>ItemsBag</code> have the same signature, but I really want to know if I could do this, it's very interesting.</p>

<p>I could get away using a variable number of arguments <code>params obejct[] args</code> but it would be nice to do it in a way that doesn't involve boxing/unboxing.</p>

<p>I could also make a <code>TwoDimBag</code> and <code>OneDimBag</code> make them both inherit from <code>Bag</code>, write the definitions of <code>AddSlot</code> in them the way I want to, and then make <code>ItemsBag</code> inherit <code>TwoDimBag</code> and <code>DCBag</code> inherit <code>OneDimBag</code>, but I'm not looking for work-arounds more than how to achieve what I'm asking for.</p>

<p>Again to recap one last time: how can I write a signature that I could override in the inheriting children? (that is, if I can and there is a way)</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT: (Extra Info)
The <code>Bag</code> has a lot of functionality in it. The difference between the two bags is that <code>ItemsBag</code> holds a 2d List of Slot (<code>List&lt;List&lt;Slot&gt;&gt;</code>), while <code>DCBag</code> has a 1d <code>List</code> of <code>Slot</code>. It's the <code>Slot</code> that holds an <code>Item</code>. - Items in <code>ItemsBag</code> could take more than one <code>Slot</code>, items in <code>DCBag</code> take only one.</p>

<p>Some of the things you can do in both bags: <code>AddSlot</code>, <code>FreeSlot</code>, <code>AddItem</code> (adding strategy differs, there are also extra adding methods in <code>ItemsBag</code>), in both the bags you could pickup an item with your mouse, swap items, sort items, both bags also receive notifications from slots to take necessary actions like <code>Notify_ClickedOnEmptySlot(Slot slot)</code></p>

<p>Some of things you can only do in <code>ItemsBag</code>:
Combine items, adding a row of slots, adding a col of slots and rotate items.</p>

<p>Here's how the bags differ in terms of appearance, <code>ItemsBag</code> (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-RxdtzI6Hs"" rel=""nofollow"">here's</a> an old demo):</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> is very straightforward. <strong>Step 2</strong>, kind of. I can open that url in a new window, but then, the rest of the process takes place in that new window.

<p>Is there any way to do this? I've seen in more sites.

<p>I know topics like this have been beaten to death here so suffice to say I'm not asking about which framework is better, I don't really care about opinions on the better framework. They all do pretty amazing things.</p>

<h2>The Question</h2>

<p>Given that I have an existing web application, made of mostly regular HTML+CSS (jQuery where needed), which is the optimal framework to integrate a few ""rich"" pages into typically a regular stream of HTML.</p>

<h2>Reason</h2>

<p>I am trying to bring our proven application into the realm of awesome desktop like UI but I want to do it one small piece, one screen at time. But for our users, support personel and especially me taking it slow is the only option.</p>

<h2>Experience Thus Far</h2>

<p><strong>Dojo + Dijit</strong><br>
<em>Pros</em>: The new 1.5 widgets plus the claro theme is the cure for what ails us. Dojo seems to be able to use markup to create the UI which is very appealing and has a fair amount of widgets.</p>

<p><em>Cons</em>: Holy bloated lib Batman! Dojo seems to be enormous and I have to learn a custom build system to get it to stop requesting 4,800 javascript files. This complex empire of Javascript makes me believe I won't be able to create much that isn't already there.</p>

<p><strong>ExtJS</strong><br>
<em>Pros</em>: Amazing set of widgets, does everything we could possibly want. Seems quick, every version brings new improvements.</p>

<p><em>Cons</em>: I'm not sure how to use this without the entire display being EXT. I'm still building a web site, so I would prefer something that could integrate into what we already have. Some pointers here would be great.</p>

<p><strong>YUI</strong><br>
<em>Pros</em>: Well, it's Yahoo isn't it? AWS console is downright wicked. Plenty of support and a giant community.</p>

<p><em>Cons</em>: Well, it's Yahoo isn't it? AWS console is the only wicked thing. Complex for someone who's used to jQuery.</p>

<h2>Help Me</h2>

<p>Java compiler doesn't issue a compile error, even though we are adding an int inside the arrayList, as it converts (by using the Wrapper Class Integer) it to the following code:</p>

<p>Order does not matter, but if sorting makes it more efficient then I am up for the challenge...</p>

<p>and for people who do not know o is a label and it is just saying jump back to the loop instead of pushing to the new array.</p>

<p>For example, if I write my own SQL query (which does not takes more than 100ms to execute) this is like that:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT id,
       country_id,
       firstName,
       lastName
FROM client
WHERE client.country_id IN (2564,2558,1452,3652)
</code></pre>

<p>But if I using hibernate with filters, the generated query will be:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT _this.id         AS id1_0_0,
       _this.country_id AS country_id2_0_0
       _this.firstName  AS firstName3_0_0,

   SELECT id,

          lastName
   FROM client
) _this
WHERE _this.country_id2_0_0 IN (2564,2558,1452,3652)
</code></pre>

<p>This means that the SQL generated by hibernate is slower than my sql query written by hand because all rows of the 'client' table (in nested query) are loaded, and filter operation is executed in parent query after having loaded all rows, this is stupid and provides very slow performances (1.7sec vs less than 100ms). So, does anyone known a method to avoid that ?</p>

<p>Knowing that each service request made by different users should use a different Channel IÂ´m thinking in cache the Channel per-request (HttpContext.Current.Items) and cache the ChannelFactory used to create the channel per Application (HttpApplication.Items) since I can create more than one channel with the same ChannelFactory.</p>

<p>However, I have a question regarding this cache mechanism when it comes to closing the ChannelFactory and Channel. </p>

<p>1) Do I need to close the channel after itÂ´s used, in the end of the request or is it ok to leave it there to be closed (?) when the context of that request dies?
2) What about ChannelFactory? Since each channel is associated with the ChannelFactory that created it, is it safe to keep the same ChannelFactory during the life of the application process (AppDomain)?</p>

<p>This is the code IÂ´m using to manage this:</p>

<pre><code>public class ServiceFactory
{
    private static Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt; ListOfOpenedChannels
    {
        get
        {
            if (null == HttpContext.Current.Items[HttpContext.Current.Session.SessionID + ""_ListOfOpenedChannels""])
            {
                HttpContext.Current.Items[HttpContext.Current.Session.SessionID + ""_ListOfOpenedChannels""] = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;();
            }

            return (Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;)HttpContext.Current.Items[HttpContext.Current.Session.SessionID + ""_ListOfOpenedChannels""];
        }
        set
        {
            HttpContext.Current.Items[HttpContext.Current.Session.SessionID + ""_ListOfOpenedChannels""] = value;
        }
    }

    public static T CreateServiceChannel&lt;T&gt;()
    {
        string key = typeof(T).Name;

        if (ListOfOpenedChannels.ContainsKey(key))
        {

<p>Can I still start an Activity through this class, or how would I go about doing this? I have also tried sending a broadcast, but this is also not ""implemented"".</p>

The problem is I am using jquery to apply an opacity style to the active anchor. and the other sibling anchor get a lesser opacity view. My code looks like this</p>

<pre><code>$(""#menutab li a"").click(function(){
 $(this).animate({opacity:'1'},1000);
  $(this).siblings().animate({opacity:'.25'},1000);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would think this code would act only on the clicked element and apply that css style to that element and the other style to the other anchor tags except the clicked one. It kind of does that, but also what it does is leave the earlier clicked element to opacity =1, so if I click an element it sets it opacity to 1 and then if I click another one it sets it opacity to 1 while leave the earlier clicked one to 1 also instead of setting it to .25 like the others.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
 I changed the above code to:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#menutab ul li"").click(function(){
 $(this).children().animate({opacity:'1'},1000);
  $(this).siblings().children().animate({opacity:'.25'},1000);
});
</code></pre>

<p>and now I get the desired effect, except that when the first anchor in the list is clicked doesn't follow the event rules, When the first one is clicked its as if, the click event is not triggered, because no opacity style changes. which I don't understand.</p>

<p>The map is quite large, and is already <em>well</em> integrated into the project already, and there are only a handful of keys that require this conversion so I think it will be wasteful to change the map into one that accepts <code>std::wstring</code> as the key.</p>

<p>The output of the conversion doesn't really matter, but it has to be consistent so as to reliably pull the correct values from the map every time.</p>

<p>The application is a Windows only application.</p>

<p>Is there any known process to do a rough conversion reliably for this purpose? Or would the best way be via the usual, proper, conversion process (as described in this SO question/answer: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4804298/how-to-convert-wstring-into-string"">How to convert wstring into string?</a>)?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Please bear in mind - losing information is fine <strong>as long as</strong> things are consistent. i.e. If I throw in some Japanese characters, and they consistently convert into the same (potentially garbage) <code>std::string</code>, that's fine. This will never be for display, only to be used as a key to pull out values from a map.</p>

<p>Using Kolorbot's <a href=""https://github.com/kolorobot/spring-mvc-quickstart-archetype"" rel=""nofollow"">Spring MVC 4 Quickstart archetype</a> I created an entity, a repository and a service class which is accessed by a controller method. In my entity I have a ManyToOne relationship to another entity by fetching it lazily.</p>

<p>In my controller method I invoke the service's method which itself invokes a method on the repository which eventually fetches the needed data and passes it on through the layers.</p>

<p>Accessing the entity's attributes in the controller's method that point to the related entity I receive a ""LazyInitializationException"". </p>

<pre><code>org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy - no Session
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Research and attempts to fix the problem</h2>

<p>While reading up on the problem I stumbled upon solutions describing the usage of the @Transactional annotation which does not help or the inclusion of the OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter that is supposed to force the session to stay open until the controller's method are processed.</p>

<p>The inclusion of the OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
protected Filter[] getServletFilters() {
    OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter openEntityManagerInViewFilter = new OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter();
    openEntityManagerInViewFilter.setBeanName(""openEntityManagerInViewFilter"");

    ...

    return new Filter[] {openEntityManagerInViewFilter, characterEncodingFilter, securityFilterChain};
}
</code></pre>

<p>The usage of the filter leads to the following exception:</p>

<pre><code>org.hibernate.HibernateException: Javassist Enhancement failed: com.example.package.RelatedEntity
at org.hibernate.proxy.pojo.javassist.JavassistLazyInitializer.getProxy(JavassistLazyInitializer.java:143)
at org.hibernate.proxy.pojo.javassist.JavassistProxyFactory.getProxy(JavassistProxyFactory.java:73)
</code></pre>

<p>RelatedEntity is the object I try to access through the original entity I am interested in.</p>

<p><strike>
By setting the lazy fetching mechanism to false I receive the following exception (thrown in my controller's method):</p>

<pre><code>Could not commit JPA transaction; nested exception is javax.persistence.RollbackException: Transaction marked as rollbackOnly] with root cause
javax.persistence.RollbackException: Transaction marked as rollbackOnly
    at org.hibernate.ejb.TransactionImpl.commit(TransactionImpl.java:72)
</code></pre>

<p></strike></p>

<p><em>By removing the try/catch block in the repository's <code>findEntityById()</code> method (see below) and adding the annotation <code>@Transactional(noRollbackFor = PersistenceException.class)</code> I was able to enable eager loading.</em> But this is just a temporary solution. Nevertheless I'd like to use lazy fetching.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Source code section</h2>

<p>The entity class that is returned by the service method:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Table(name = ""Entity"")
@NamedQuery(
        name = Entity.FIND_BY_ID,
        query = ""select e from Entity e where e.id = :id""
)
public class Entity {

    public static final String FIND_BY_ID = ""Entity.findById"";

    @Id
    @Column(name = ID)
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    @Getter
    private Long id;

    ...

    @ManyToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name=RelatedEntity.ID)
    @Getter
    private RelatedEntity relatedEntity;

    ...

    protected Entity() {}

    public Entity(String param1) {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>And the RelatedEntity that I try to access through an instance of Entity:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Table(name = ""RELATED_ENTITY"")
@NamedQuery(name = RelatedEntity.FIND_BY_ID, query = ""select re from RelatedEntity re where re.id = :id"")
public class RelatedEntity {

    public static final String FIND_BY_ID = ""RelatedEntity.findById"";
    public static final String ID = ""RE_ID"";

    @Id
    @Column(name=ID)
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    ...

    @OneToMany(mappedBy=""relatedEntity"")
    private List&lt;Entity&gt; entities;

    ...

    protected RelatedEntity() {}

    public RelatedEntity(String param1) {
        ...
    }

}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Finally, the repository and the service class:</p>

<pre><code>@Repository
public class EntityRepository {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager entityManager;

    @Transactional(noRollbackFor = PersistenceException.class)
    public List&lt;Entity&gt; findEntityById(Long id) {
        return entityManager.createNamedQuery(Entity.FIND_BY_ID, Entity.class)
                .setParameter(""id"", id)
                .getResultList();
    }

}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>@Service
public class DefaultEntityService implements EntityService {

    @Autowired
    EntityRepository entityRepository;

    ...

    @Override
    public List&lt;Entity&gt; findEntitiesById(Long id) {
        return entityRepository.findAgreementById(id);
    }

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>I am not exactly sure what happened but suddenly the OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter seems to work and the session's still open when accessing the entity's properties in my controller and view. A further insight into the lazy fetching mechanism and the possible solutions to avoid the LazyInitializationException is well documented in the <a href=""http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.5/reference/en/html/performance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Hibernate Community Documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The initialization of the lazily fetched object through <code>Hibernate.initialize()</code> in the service layer is a valid alternative but generates too much unnecessary overhead.</p>

<p>In the top cell (used for the <strong>user name</strong>) I have embedded a <code>UIButton</code> which I use to open an <code>UIActionSheet</code> which in turn allows an <code>UIImagePicker</code> to set an image on the UIButton (i.e. <code>[button.imageView.image = imageFromImagePicker]</code>). The button has a default image (added in IB) which says ""add image"".</p>

<p>The image on the button is set without issue and remains in place even when I navigate to the detail page of any of the table cells with the exception of the <strong>user name</strong> cell which contains the button. When I select this cell the image dissapears and does not reappear once I navigate back to the <strong>AddUserTableViewController</strong> from the ""add name"" detail view. The ""add image"" default image, referred to above, is displayed.</p>

<p>I have tried many strategies amongst which have been:</p>

<p>1) using <code>[self.tableView reloadData]</code>, <code>[button.imageView setNeedsDisplay]</code>, <code>[self.view setNeedsDisplay]</code> in the <code>viewWillAppear</code> method;</p>

<p>2) using the above methods in the <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> method;</p>

<p>3) using the above methods in the overriden <code>willDisplayCell:forRowAtIndexPath:</code> method;</p>

<p>When I place debugging NSLog statements in the program I can see that the <code>button.imageView.image</code> property is still set to the image selected using the <code>UIImagePicker</code> but it is not displayed (the default image from the nib is displayed).</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, this only happens if I navigate away from the <strong>AddUserTableViewController</strong> by selecting the <code>UITableViewCell</code> within which the <code>UIButton</code> is embedded. </p>

<p>I am currently at a loss as to what to do and would be extremely grateful for any assistance that anyone could offer. I just need to find a way to update the image on the embedded UIButton in the above-mentioned circumstances.</p>

<p>I developed a HTML-5 based extension for Adobe Creative Cloud Applications (Adobe CC have the chromium framework built in that supports HTML based extensions) in which I used the angularJS framework. </p>

<p>I tested it on many systems at my end and it is working perfectly fine. But when I sent the same application to my friends. For some of themâ the view is loaded fine, the button clicks were working fine too but the <strong>input text</strong> was not binded properly! I keep on getting the blank text from it- I used <code>ng-model</code> for by <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> boxes. </p>

<p>Here's my code-</p>

<p><strong>View-</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;   
   &lt;input type='text' placeholder='Email' ng-model='user.email' /&gt;
   &lt;input type='password' placeholder='Password' ng-model='user.password' /&gt;
   &lt;button ng-click='login()'&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

$scope.login=function(){
   if($scope.user.email!="""" &amp;&amp; $scope.user.password!=""""){

<p>I have other views with the similar form-like structure and getting the same issue there also! </p>

<p>I can access the <strong>developer console</strong>, so I asked the users getting this issue to send me the console's content; but everything looked fine there. There were no errors showing on the console! Can I log something useful there that can help me finding the issue?</p>

<p>Since I'm not able to replicate this at my end, I'm getting no hint how to solve this thing. I'm not able to think what could be the possible reason(s) for this behaviour. This is weird!</p>

I don't want to use a screen shot feature, I want to be able to redirect (xor capture also) the output to the monitor to some sort of byte-stream. I note that monitors are much better than semaphores, when you are talking about display capabilities; I don't need a counter example. </p>

<p>I might not be asking the correct question. It might be that I want to capture the file while it is still in User Space, before it is put into 'Device Space'. I would like to try and capture the byte stream so that I can convert it to MPEG-4 format. I either need a streaming output from the MPEG-4 converter, coming from the streaming input, or else, I need to take static images at discrete times and convert the images. </p>

I want the UIAlertview only appear, when a certain distance to the beacon has been reached. First I thought about firing the Alertview in the ""didrangebeacons"" delegate method. But this would fire the AlertView once per second. Then I thought I should do this in the didEnterRegion, but then it will be fired as soon as the user is in range (maybe 20m away). </p>

<p>What would be the best practice to implement that correctly? I thought about a flag I would set. For example: create a flag called ""showAlert"" and set it initially to ""YES"" in the DidEnterRegion Delegate Method. As soon as a certain RSSI is reached I Present the alertview and set it to NO after that. As soon as the region of the beacon has been exited I will be set back to YES. </p>

<p>My problem is with the collision detection. It is definitely working, but the problem is that I get too many collisions. My tiles are next to each other, edge-to-edge.

Here's my code for creating the rows, and I've commented out the LayoutParams bit, and there is no change when I run the app, which says to me that the LayoutParams are being ignored. <strong>I need some help assigning layout_weight to the two TextViews so that in my row-creating code I can achieve this</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;TextView
        android:id=""@+id/textView1""
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_marginLeft=""10dp""
        android:layout_weight=""1"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So here's my code to create the rows:</p>

<pre><code>        TableLayout tl = (TableLayout) findViewById(R.id.pres_table);

    for (int ctr = 0; ctr &lt; pres_res.size(); ctr++)

    {
        final String pst_str = pres_res.get(ctr);
        final String yrs_str = yrs_res.get(ctr);

        TableRow tr = new TableRow(this);
        /*
        TableRow.LayoutParams trPara = new TableRow.LayoutParams(
                TableRow.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,
                TableRow.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);
        int leftMargin = 10;
        int topMargin = 2;
        int rightMargin = 10;
        int bottomMargin = 2;
        trPara.setMargins(leftMargin, topMargin, rightMargin, bottomMargin);
        tr.setLayoutParams(trPara);

         */
        TextView tv1 = new TextView(this);
        tv1.setText(pst_str);
        tv1.setTextColor(Color.BLACK);
        tv1.setTextSize(18);

        TextView tv2 = new TextView(this);
        tv2.setText(yrs_str);
        tv2.setTextColor(Color.BLACK);
        tv2.setTextSize(18);

        tr.addView(tv1);
        tr.addView(tv2);
        tl.addView(tr, new TableLayout.LayoutParams(
                LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>and the XML to create the Table is basic like this:</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;TableLayout
            android:id=""@+id/pres_table""
            android:layout_width=""match_parent""
            android:layout_height=""match_parent""
            android:background=""#FFFFFF"" &gt;
        &lt;/TableLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>1) I would prefer python is good , looking from the angle that I need not bother about it until I call the function hello(name) . If i called the function during execution phase , then an error would be flung as ""NameError: global name 'sample' is not defined"".</p>

<p>2) But it looks danger by looking at the angle that it might fling such errors in execution time . But java tells all these things even during compile time .</p>

<p>3) also if I want to distribute the python code as .pyc file , using py_compile.compile(""prog.py"") . The pyc file is generated without warning that 'sample' is an undefined variable . This puts me at risk because these errors might be discovered in production ,which is too dangerous .</p>

<p>What am I to interpret from this type of working of python . Why is it designed to be so ? what is the advantage in not being so strict while compilation (py -> pyc ) ? Is it not dangerous ?</p>

<p>We have never had this problem in our local servers (server/client on the same machine), but when we went live, some users experienced this problem randomely (about 5% of the 800 beta users).</p>

<p>Lately, at last i was able to reproduce the problem every once in a while on <em>one client</em> machine (windows XP), in our LAN using a remote server in the same LAN (but not on other client machines who share the same LAN and are roughly the same configuration).</p>

<p>And when this happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using firebug / flashbug : I can see that the amf request is sent and waiting for a response.</li>
<li>On the server there is nothing in the logs (no request received).</li>
<li>After some timeout, the client shows the above error (<strong>http code 404</strong>).</li>
<li>Then for the subsequent requests, everything returns to normal untill the error  eventually happens again</li>
</ul>

<p>(Clients are Windows XP, Firefox + adobe flash player, Server is WebSphere 7)</p>

<p>My questions are: 
is there a way to find out what's going on ? 
is it a packet loss ? 
is it because of the client browser / adobe player ?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>[Edit]</p>

<p>Using Wireshark (on both the client and server side), i can see that when the problem occurs no tcp connection is made:
 - Firebug detects an outgoing http amf request 
 - Wireshark doesn't detect any activity on either side.</p>

<p>So it's defenitly Adobe Flash Plugin / Firefox plugin container, am i right ? is that a known issue ?</p>

These repositories sometimes depends on each other (using svn:external) e.g. some end-user-project using core team repo and so on.</p>

<p>I want to move from SVN to Mercurial with my team. I wish to setup workflow like this</p>

<ol>
<li>Initially clone our current SVN repo into Mercurial, put it to some server and serve it to team members (with <code>hg serve</code> for a first time)</li>
<li>Team members start to work with Mercural only, no direct SVN commits, updates, checkouts. Only push/pull to/from root Mercurial repo (was set up at step 1.).</li>
<li>Eventually (some cron job?) our Mercurial repo is get synced to old SVN server to allow other teams to access our work.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm wondering is it ever possible to do this kind of setup?
I've already read <a href=""http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/HgSubversion"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> article on HgSubversion extension, but it can't give me third step - upstream sync to SVN then changes to Mercurial is came from remote team member.</p>

<p>Method 2 calls the utils directly from the same library:</p>

<pre><code>String username;
ChatInterface tmp=CommonUtils.getChatByUsername(username); &lt;---- This is ""the problem""

<p>Now, when I try to inspect what is inside the ""ArrayList connectedChat"", I see two different results: the right one is when I take info from the first method. Otherwise, when I try to take something out from the ""Method 2"", it says that the ArrayList is empty, so I can't operate anymore (but from the other method it seems that the list isn't empty!).</p>

<p>The thing that I'm trying to resolve is a kind of Chat service... it works from client sender - server - client receiver, but it seems that it doesn't work in the simply server sender - client receiver communication.</p>

Attributes:
1) { PersonID = 123456, AttributeTypeID = 'Height', AttributeValue = '6'6'''}

 ID = 123456, Name = 'John Smith', Age = 25, Height = '6'6''', Weight = '220lbs', EyeColor = 'Blue'
}

<p>To make things worse my persons are in a table variable.</p>

<p>So, I have (in a sp with a parameter of person_id):</p>

<pre><code>--result table
declare @people_info table
(
person_id int,
name nvarchar(max),
age int,
height nvarchar(10) null,
weight nvarchar(10) null,
eye_color nvarchar(16) null
)


insert into @people_info
 select person_id, name, age, null, null, null
  from dbo.HR.people where person_id = @person_id

update pi
 set
  pi.height = (select pa.attribute_value where pa.attribute_type_id = 'Height'),
  pi.height = (select pa.attribute_value where pa.attribute_type_id = 'Weight'),
  pi.eye_color = (select pa.attribute_value where pa.attribute_type_id = 'EyeColor')
 from
  @people_info pi
   inner join dbo.HR.person_attributes pa on pi.person_id = pa.person_id

select * from @people_info
</code></pre>

<p>Which of course does not work for some reason.
If I query the two joined tables and select ""pa.attribute_value where pa.attribute_type_id = 'someval'"" I get the correct value. But the update does not work.</p>

<p>Of course, I can write this as three updates, but I am thinking that it will be faster to do one join and then to filter in the update clause.</p>

<p>Also, please keep in mind that my attributes are spread over three tables, not just the attributes table. So, this is why I have the table variable.</p>

In a main-program i load all plugins by looking for the plugin interface in the assembly.</p>

<p>All my plugins (VB.NET v4.0 and C# v4.0) based on WPF will be recognized, except one. This plugin is using ResourceDictionaries, lots of Templates and subdirectories.
This plugin is written in Visual Studio 2010 and Expression Blend 4 in C# based on WPF 4.0.</p>

<p>Its very odd, because the plugin is recognized in the main program. But after a few tests and builds the main program stops recognizing the plugin.</p>

<p>I made a backup of the working plugin and the plugin, which is not recognized anymore.
The csproj files are pretty much the same and also the settings.</p>

<p>I can't find a solution and google also does'nt know very much about this problem.</p>

<p>If found some infos, that XAML code effects the assembly, so other programs can't recognize it. But there are no specific infos about that and also no solution.</p>

<p>Does anyone know that problem and much better - does anyone know a solution?</p>

<p>How does one identify what the constraints actually mean?
For example I have a <code>profile-type-id: 42801e</code> that translates to:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/CZfUE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>How am I to relate that to the features defined in the table <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC#Profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>?</p>

<p>The above reference identified that the <code>Constraint_set0_flag: 1</code> means that it's the <em>Constrained Baseline Profile</em>. But how to relate the flag to the three different NO's (from the table) that differentiate the <em>Baseline profile</em> from the <em>Constrained Baseline Profile</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Can't confirm that the above, about identifying the <code>Constrained Baseline profile</code>, is correct. <a href=""https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-H.264-201304-S!!PDF-E&amp;type=items"" rel=""nofollow"">Reference</a> (page 306) for that statement:</p>

<pre><code>Decoders conforming to the Constrained Baseline profile at a 
specific level shall be capable of decoding all bitstreams 
in which all of the following are true:

â profile_idc is equal to 66 or constraint_set0_flag is equal to 1,
â constraint_set1_flag is equal to 1, 
â level_idc and constraint_set3_flag represent a level 
less than or equal to the specified level.
</code></pre>

<p>It seems only the first condition is fulfilled but the second is false. The parameters for the Baseline profile state</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Decoders conforming to the Baseline profile at a specific level shall be capable of decoding all bitstreams in which
  profile_idc is equal to 66 or constraint_set0_flag is equal to 1 and in which level_idc and constraint_set3_flag represent a

<p>This mostly works completely fine. The new div is created with all of the listed styles and added to the DOM, but the '-webkit-overflow-scrolling' property is not there. Is it just not possible to do this with jQuery?</p>

"7170394","1","7170548","","2011-08-24 04:20:10","","0","141","<p>There is a forward C struct declared in an unmodifiable header. I would like to ""virtually"" add convenience member functions to it.  Obviously my first choice would be to extend the struct and add the methods to the derived class.  No-can-do, as the struct itself is declared as ""forward"" in the header, so I get the error ""error: invalid use of incomplete type ..."".  I get a similar error if I try to define a new struct with a single element of the old struct.  This sucks.</p>

<p>However, I was thinking that I could do some hackery with reinterpret_cast to get it to work anyway.  The way it would go is this:</p>

<pre><code>//defined in header
struct A forward;
void do_something_with_A(A* a, int arg);

//defined in my wrapper
struct B {
  B* wrap(A* a) {return reinterpret_cast&lt;B*&gt;(a); }
  void do_something(int arg) {do_something_with_A(reinterpret_cast&lt;A*&gt;(this),arg); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I added implicit conversions from type B to type A, I was thinking that this could work out <em>almost</em> as if B was a zero-data inheritor of A.  However, this obviously brings up the question:  is this undefined in C++?  Normally I would think that accessing an element of an illegally casted struct would be undefined; that makes sense.  However, I would think that reinterpret_casting from one type to another, passing that pointer around, and then casting back again, without doing anything illegal in between would be fine.  I would also think that the way a compiler implements non-virtual struct members would be creating a function</p>

<pre><code>B::do_something(B* b, int arg)
</code></pre>

<p>and calling that with the appropriate argument for B.  This then reduces to the previous case, which by my dubious logic is okay.    So I would think calling .do_something on a struct which is actually a reinterpret_cast A would be okay.</p>

<p>However, this says nothing for what the C++ standard actually says on the matter.   Any help with that?  Also, if someone has information on how well this will work practically, (i.e. ""Every compiler ever made accepts this"", or ""this only works with a few compilers"") that would also be helpful, but slightly less so.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://blog.codebusters.pl/en/entry/google-maps-in-hidden-div"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codebusters.pl/en/entry/google-maps-in-hidden-div</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://dougmolineux.com/wp/?p=242"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dougmolineux.com/wp/?p=242</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But I can't get my issue solved.</p>

<p>So I've got a responsive site built Mobile first and I'm trying to get an adaptive map solution working i.e. mobile viewports get a static Google map image and for non-mobile viewports the full Google map API and this all has to update itself when the viewport resizes not just on page load. Based on this: <a href=""http://codepen.io/bradfrost/pen/tLxAs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepen.io/bradfrost/pen/tLxAs</a>.</p>

<p>I'm using <a href=""http://wicky.nillia.ms/enquire.js/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>this library</strong></a>. </p>

<p>I'm conditionally loading the Maps API only when it's needed (non-mobile viewports) via jQuery's <code>$.getScript</code> and the libraries <code>setup()</code> and <code>defer()</code> functions. </p>

<p>So that there's only the right map rendering at each viewport I'm using jQuery <code>hide()</code> and <code>show()</code> because of this the API map won't fully load itself (just 1 tile), well it does load fine if the page loads at a non-mobile viewport size, it's when you resize to mobile viewport back to non-mobile viewport size as that's when the <code>show()</code> method kicks in. Everything else works fine.</p>

<p>Here's my code:</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""map""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""map__static""&gt;
        &lt;img src=""http://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=-33.867487,151.20699&amp;zoom=15&amp;markers=-33.867487,151.20699&amp;size=650x405&amp;sensor=false""&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The static map image is loaded by default as the site is built Mobile first.</p>

<p><strong>JS</strong></p>

<pre><code>var mapContainer = $('.map'),
mapStaticContainer = $('.map__static');
mapDynamicContainer = $('&lt;div class=""map__dynamic""/&gt;');

// Start Enquire library
enquire.register('screen and (min-width: 40em)', {

    deferSetup: true,

    setup: function setup() {
        mapContainer.prepend(mapDynamicContainer);
        mapDynamicContainer.load('/includes/scripts/adaptive-google-map.php', function() {
            $.getScript('https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyAywjPmf5WvWh_cIn35NwtIk-gYuwu1I2Q&amp;sensor=false&amp;callback=initialize');
        });
    },

    // Not mobile size viewport
    match: function() {
        mapStaticContainer.hide();
        mapDynamicContainer.show();
    },

    // Mobile size viewport
    unmatch: function() { 
        mapStaticContainer.show();
        mapDynamicContainer.hide();
    }

}, true).listen();
</code></pre>

<p>This is the contents of <strong>'/includes/scripts/adaptive-google-map.php'</strong> which is AJAX'd in via jQuery <code>load()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""map_canvas""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    function initialize() {
    var myLatlng = new google.maps.LatLng(-33.867487,151.20699);
    var myOptions = {
      zoom: 15,
      center: myLatlng,
      mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP,
      scrollwheel: false
    }
    map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map_canvas'), myOptions);
    var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
        position: myLatlng,
        map: map,
        animation: google.maps.Animation.DROP
    });
    var contentString = 
        '&lt;div class=""infowindow""&gt;'+
            '&lt;div&gt;'+
                    '&lt;p class=""flush""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SALES OFFICE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;1/16 M. 5&lt;br&gt;Sydney&lt;br&gt;NSW, 83110.&lt;/p&gt;'
            '&lt;/div&gt;'+
        '&lt;/div&gt;'
    ;
    var infowindow = new google.maps.InfoWindow({
        content: contentString
    });
    google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'click', function() {
        infowindow.open(map,marker);
    });
    // Center Google Maps (V3) on browser resize (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8792676/center-google-maps-v3-on-browser-resize-responsive)
    var center;
    function calculateCenter() {
        center = map.getCenter();
    }
    google.maps.event.addDomListener(map, 'idle', function() {
        calculateCenter();
    });
    google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'resize', function() {
        map.setCenter(center);
    });
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This fixes the problem:</p>

<pre><code>mapDynamicContainer.show(function () {
    setTimeout(function() {
    initialize(); 
}, 100);
 })
</code></pre>

<p>But throws a JS error: <code>Uncaught ReferenceError: initialize is not defined</code>. Another common fix suggested by ppl. is applying this: <code>google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize');</code> but when I put that after: <code>mapDynamicContainer.show();</code> in the <code>match()</code> function I get this JS error: <code>Uncaught ReferenceError: google is not defined</code>. </p>

<p>Not having much luck :(</p>

<p>My problem was that I used event.preventDefault() instead of return false to hinder the form from posting normally. FF and IE didn't like that and broke the JS by that line. I removed that and appended return false at the end and this solved the problem. Thanks to Darin Dimitrov for the extensive checklist.</p>

<p><strong>Original question</strong></p>

<p>I'm using ASP.NET MVC3 and jquery ajax to post json-data to the server and receive a response. However, when I'm using Chrome it reads the json-response normally, updating the divs that I want etc. With IE and FF it doesn't work though. They read just the response and shows only that on the page.</p>

<p>I saw some other threads mentioning to define the mime type as ""text/plain"". This changed the previous behavior of prompting the user to download the json-response instead. </p>

<p>This is the javascript for making the post:</p>

<pre><code> $.ajax({
        url: $(""#formRegister"").attr(""action""),
        type: 'POST',
        data: JSON.stringify(user),
        dataType: 'json',
        contentType: 'application/json, charset=utf-8',
        traditional: true,
        success: function (data) {
            alertMessage(data.Message);

        },
        error: function () {

        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>This is the ActionMethod receiving the call and returning a JsonResponse:</p>

<pre><code>[HttpPost]
    public JsonResult Register(UserRegisterPackage package)
    {
        ClientAlert alert = new ClientAlert();
        if (package.Password != null)
        {       
            //bool success = Removed for simplicity's sake.
            bool success = true;
            if (success)
            {                    
                alert.Message = ""Success!"";                    
            }
            else
            {                    
                alert.Message = ""Failed to register"";                    
            }
        }
        else
        {                
            alert.Message = ""You need to enter a password!"";                
        }
        return Json(alert, ""text/plain"");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>As I said, when the content type is defined as text/plain the browser shows only the response and when it's not defined it prompts the user to download the json-response instead.</p>

<p>With FF I seem to get an error about: </p>

<pre><code>""event is not defined
event.preventDefault(); ""
</code></pre>

<p>This could have something to do with the error.. but I need to prevent the form from posting normally. Is this done differently in FF or IE?</p>

<p>Section 5.7/1 says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] For addition, either both operands shall have arithmetic or
  unscoped enumeration type, or one operand shall be a pointer to a
  <strong>completely-defined object</strong> type and the other shall have integral or
  unscoped enumeration type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok. But consider the rule from the section 3.7.4.3/3:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â the result of an additive or bitwise operation, one of whose
  operands is an integer representation of a safely-derived pointer
  value <code>P</code>, if that result converted by <code>reinterpret_cast&lt;void*&gt;</code> would
  compare equal to a safely-derived pointer computable from
  <code>reinterpret_cast&lt;void*&gt;(P)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, we cannot apply pointer arithmetic to a pointer to <code>void</code>. Could you possibly provide an example reflecting the rule from <strong>3.7.4.3</strong>?</p>

<p>The similiar <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/25174236/390913"">question</a> doesn't provide  a suitable example, because the pointer to void arithmetic appers here.</p>

<p>I am able to achieve the xAxis labels perfectly in my HTML page. The problem is, I need to save image of the graph. For this, I have used canvg. The image appears but this xAxis text which is set using chart.renderer.text.css is not appearing in the image. </p>

<p>The xAxis labels attribute is fine but it doesn't allow me to add padding before the first label and after the first label. </p>

<p>Can anyone please suggest me an alternative to canvg which will take chart.render.text.css also while saving image OR a way to position the labels in highChart as shown in code.</p>

<p>We do not have a div for the HighChart, we are putting it in ExtJS panel. Can this be a reason for the label not appearing in snapshot?</p>

All of the examples I have seen use a submit button or similar to send the data back to the client. I'd rather submit as soon as a row is added/deleted/modified. I thought of a couple of approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have my IEnuerable Itemsource property automatically bound to my context's entitycontainer. I tried this but I cant set the context's entities from the property. </li>
<li>Capture the row change events and manually tell my context that is has changed items. This doesnt feel right though in a MVVM design considering my Commodity property should reflect changes in the datagrid. </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, how do I tell RIA Services what method it should be using for a particular crud operation? Does this happen on the client or server?</p>

I'm wondering why Xcode does show the method <code>dataWithContentsOfURL</code>. But the Apple doc site has the method. My sample code is alike:</p>

<pre><code>let baseURL = NSURL(string: ""https://api.forecast.io"") //sample url
let weatherData = NSData.
</code></pre>

<p>So, if I try to manually add that method, it shows an error :(</p>

<p>Is it a bug of my xcode or something else? anybody faces ever this type of issue before?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
I tried to use the following line of code and it worked nicely:</p>

<pre><code>let weatherData = NSData(contentsOfURL: baseURL!, options: nil, error: nil)
</code></pre>

<p>Actually, I followed one YouTube tutorial and I searched in app doc under Objectiv-C section and there is a method dataWithContentsOfURL. But when I moved to Swift section, it is not there. So that is the proper way to resolve this using Swift. :)</p>

<p>I'm trying to chain an all statements in protractor but I'm getting the error.</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'all'
</code></pre>

<p>I'm looking at the API code on the following page</p>

<p><a href=""http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/api?view=ElementArrayFinder.prototype.all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/api?view=ElementArrayFinder.prototype.all</a></p>

<p>Which indicates that you can use element.all(locator).all(locator)</p>

<p>it gives this as an example</p>

<pre><code>var foo = element.all(by.css('.parent')).all(by.css('.foo'))
</code></pre>

<p>my code seems to be very similar, and I'm confused why I'm getting this error. I've tried structuring the code exactly like they have it on the API example. I've also tried doing element.all(locator).element.all(locator).</p>

<p>My GOAL here is to take a Ng-repeat of AREFS; find the one that has the text equal to r_string (which is a string generated earlier and added to the page; expect that element to exist; click that element;</p>

<p>Some Attempts:</p>

<pre><code>    var parent = element.all(by.repeater('labgroup in LabGroupService.allLabGroups'));
    var child = parent.all(by.xpath('//option[text() = \'' + r_string + '\']'));
    expect(child.count()).toBe('1');
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>    var elem = element.all(by.repeater('labgroup in LabGroupService.allLabGroups')).all(by.xpath('//option[text() = \'' + r_string + '\']'));
    expect(elem.count()).toBe('1');
</code></pre>

<p>Finally here is a snippet of the HTML i'm working with.</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;a ui-sref=""root.user-management.labgroup({labgroupID: labgroup.id})"" class=""ng-binding"" href=""#/management/labgroup/43""&gt;1kvub4wgCvY9QfA&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/dd&gt;&lt;!-- end ngRepeat: labgroup in LabGroupService.allLabGroups --&gt;&lt;dd ng-repeat=""labgroup in LabGroupService.allLabGroups"" class=""ng-scope""&gt;
        &lt;a ui-sref=""root.user-management.labgroup({labgroupID: labgroup.id})"" class=""ng-binding"" href=""#/management/labgroup/47""&gt;3PNsny8lUMlMwBw&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/dd&gt;&lt;!-- end ngRepeat: labgroup in LabGroupService.allLabGroups --&gt;&lt;dd ng-repeat=""labgroup in LabGroupService.allLabGroups"" class=""ng-scope""&gt;
        &lt;a ui-sref=""root.user-management.labgroup({labgroupID: labgroup.id})"" class=""ng-binding"" href=""#/management/labgroup/42""&gt;c3NOI7Z3933ui3a&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/dd&gt;&lt;!-- end ngRepeat: labgroup in LabGroupService.allLabGroups --&gt;&lt;dd ng-repeat=""labgroup in LabGroupService.allLabGroups"" class=""ng-scope""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>

<p>I'm starting to wonder if this is a version error or maybe a protractor error. In an attempt to debug I've literally included the source code from the API page.</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;div id='id1' class=""parent""&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li class=""foo""&gt;1a&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=""baz""&gt;1b&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id='id2' class=""parent""&gt;
     &lt;ul&gt;
       &lt;li class=""foo""&gt;2a&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;li class=""bar""&gt;2b&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;/ul&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the example from the source page.</p>

<pre><code>var foo = element.all(by.css('.parent')).all(by.css('.foo'))
expect(foo.getText()).toEqual(['1a', '2a'])
</code></pre>

<p>I'm still getting that same error.</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'all'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit 2-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>

<p>I managed to solve this issue by adding a 'data-class = labgroup-link' into the actual html code and by using this protractor code.</p>

<pre><code>    element.all(by.css('[data-class=""labgroup-link""]')).filter(function(elem, index) {
        return elem.getText().then(function(text) {
            return text === r_string;
        });
    }).then(function(filteredElements) {
        expect(filteredElements[0].isPresent()).toBe(true);
        filteredElements[0].click();
        ptor.sleep(100);
    });
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Solution ----------------------------------------</strong></p>

<p>Had to upgrade protractor to get the latest API.</p>

<p>To give a little more background, we are configuring jBPM settings using Spring. Through a web service call, we are starting the jBPM workflow. Then we restart the jBoss server. After that, through another web service call we would like to continue the workflow from where it left off. But the problem is how can we restore the session?</p>

<pre><code>Environment env = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newEnvironment();
env.set( EnvironmentName.ENTITY_MANAGER_FACTORY, jbpmEMF);
KieHelper kieHelper = new KieHelper();
KieBase kbase = kieHelper.addResource(ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource(""workflow.bpmn"")).build();
// create a new knowledge session that uses JPA to store the runtime state
StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = JPAKnowledgeService.newStatefulKnowledgeSession(kbase, null, env);

<p>To restore the session, I'm using <code>KieSession ksession = JPAKnowledgeService.loadStatefulKnowledgeSession(123, kbase, null, env );</code>. Is this the correct approach?</p>

<p>my scenario is the follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a background task that play some songs stored into a list called <strong>Song Queue</strong>.</li>
<li>I have a foreground app which display the <strong>SongQueue</strong> stored into background task.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the problem is to implement Suspending (and shutdown). </p>

<p>I understand that the foreground app can go in suspend mode (and after terminate ), but background task still play music... or not?</p>

<p>But When I trigger on visual studio, for testing pourpose, Suspend and shutdown, foreground app, also background task will terminate, stopping music.</p>

<p>So how can I implementing in the right way a suspension and shutdown process on an app which have background task playing music? have I to serialize the SongQueue? and when App resuming which is the right behaviour?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

After memcpy'ing data into the buffer everything works without a hitch.  To clean up the code I am trying to create a function that will do the memcpy'ing and buffering.  My function looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>void bufferUBOData(const GLuint uboIndex)
{
    auto uboSize = sizeRegistry.find(uboIndex)-&gt;second;
    auto buffer = bufferRegistry.find(uboIndex)-&gt;second;
    glBufferData(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, uboSize, buffer, GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW);
}

template&lt;typename T, typename... Args&gt;
void bufferUBOData(const GLuint uboIndex, T data, Args... args)
{
    auto buffer = bufferRegistry.find(uboIndex)-&gt;second;
    auto size = std::get&lt;1&gt;(dataRegistry.find(uboIndex)-&gt;second);
    auto offset = std::get&lt;2&gt;(dataRegistry.find(uboIndex)-&gt;second);
    auto type = std::get&lt;3&gt;(dataRegistry.find(uboIndex)-&gt;second);
    const int index = sizeof...(args);

memcpy(buffer + offset[index], &amp;data, size[index] * TypeSize(type[index]));
    bufferUBOData(uboIndex, args...);   
}
</code></pre>

<p>To implement the code i've done the following.</p>

<pre><code>//memcpy(buffer + offset[Scale], &amp;scale, size[Scale] * TypeSize(type[Scale]));
//memcpy(buffer + offset[Translation], &amp;translation, size[Translation] * TypeSize(type[Translation]));
//memcpy(buffer + offset[Rotation], &amp;rotation, size[Rotation] * TypeSize(type[Rotation]));
//memcpy(buffer + offset[Enabled], &amp;enabled, size[Enabled] * TypeSize(type[Enabled]));

//glBufferData(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, uboSize, buffer, GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW);
bufferUBOData(uboIndex, enabled, rotation, translation, scale);
</code></pre>

<p>Everything compiles. In the above code section if I un-comment the memcpy and glBufferData calls and comment out the bufferUBOData call everything works.  However the example as shown renders a blank screen (no geometry).</p>

<p>Note: When I use the bufferUBOData function I place the args in reverse order.</p>

"8349020","1","8528651","","2011-12-01 22:10:47","","6","1602","<p>I've been trying for some time to put some 'cool' things I've been reading about noSQL (couchDB, mongoDB, Redis...) in the past years into practical use.</p>

<p>I'm quite used to writing apps with Django, and started using Play! when Java is the only acceptable deployment option (and enjoying it too). Both have modules to work, for instance, with <a href=""http://www.mongodb.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">MongoDB</a>, and django also has <a href=""http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/django-nonrel"" rel=""nofollow"">nonrel</a>. But i never felt a need for noSQL.</p>

<p>Until I finally found what I thought was a good use case for document-oriented storage, such as MongoDB.</p>

<h2>Use Case</h2>

<p>Let's say we have to manage ordering and follow up (whatever) of some complex items. The items might have a lot of different properties, eg. oversimplifying we could have:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Fridge that can have 
<ul>
<li>one or two doors, </li>
<li>be of class A,B or C, </li>
<li>a surface color</li>
<li>standalone or built-in</li>
</ul></li>
<li>an Oven that can have:
<ul>
<li>gas or electricity or both</li>
<li>self cleaning or not</li>
<li>standalone or built-in</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>SQL/ORM solution</h2>

<p>As you can see, each object can have several properties that can be constrained by type.</p>

<p>In my usual RDBMS through an ORM I would go with defining a ""product"" model, then inherit two models, a Fridge and an Oven.
If a Fridge gets one more property some time after, I modify the model - and as such, the schema-, run a migration, and add a column.</p>

<h2>noSQL solutions</h2>

<p>noSQL solutions I can think of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>using RDF (with something like <a href=""http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Virtuoso</a> or building my own simplified triples storage)</li>
<li>using a document-oriented db such as MongoDB</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>But <strong>I fail at understanding how different (easier) development would <em>pragmatically</em> be</strong> switching to a noSQL solution still using the framework ORM with the right adapter (especially with DODB).</p>

<p>Let's say I'm using Django with MongoDB through mongodb-engine.</p>

<p>I'm still using the same ORM, so I still describe those objects as models, listing all properties. 
The ORM is thus doing exactly the same job!
The cost of producing a migration if the model changes is very limited with an ORM (in particular with something like South), nothing requiring to learn a new technology by itself.</p>

<p>There might be /other/ advantages to a DODB, and some specific to MongoDB (scalability, data-processing, maybe performance) but... what about the exact use case and problem I'm describing?</p>

<p>I am most likely missing a point, so here come the real question(s):</p>

<p>For this specific use case: </p>

<ul>
<li>is this example a good or bad one for DODB (do you have a good one)?</li>
<li>would it make sense to combine an ORM for basic stuff (Users, Orders) and usage of noSQL <strong>without</strong> ORM for complex objects, is there a compelling reason to switch to noSQL completely, or should I stay with the stock ORM/SQL?</li>
</ul>

<p>I understand answering these questions could be partially subjective, so you can assume perfect knowledge of both noSQL and SQL theory, and stock ORM; existence of good bridges from stock ORMs to noSQL DB. Let's assume we are talking about this use case with MongoDB as noSQL alternative.</p>

<p>But there is a more general question - which is the core question of this SO post:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Isn't a good ORM (such as JPA, ActiveRecord, or Django's one) making noSQL and in particular document-oriented databases of little use?</strong></li>
<li>...and is it worth using noSQL with a 'classic' ORM?</li>
</ul>

<p>(""little use"" from a programming and maintenance standpoint, performance and similar criteria are a different matter and would require a precise product-to-product comparison)</p>

<p><strong>[edit]</strong></p>

<p>What I am also trying to understand is if it wouldn't be better to drop using an ORM when switching to noSQL. It would be nice to have more ""dynamic"" models, eg. I could have a table describing what the Fridge and Oven <em>models</em> are (fields), and the Fridge and Oven models in the code would be able to construct their views dynamically (forms for editing and listings for displaying).</p>

My query below returns the right answers, but does so once for each row in the table (several thousand identical results). I can fix this by adding <code>LIMIT 1</code> the the end of the query but I'd like to understand why I'm getting the duplicates in case it points to a wider problem with my approach. The query is:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    (SELECT count(*)
        FROM
            orders
        WHERE
            totalamount &gt; 0 AND totalamount &lt;= 100) AS ""&gt;0 &lt;= 100"",

<p>EDIT
Andomar's answer also allowed me to find the following approach (adapted from an example in SQL in a nutshell (O'Reilly)). This lets me have the buckets in one column, with a row for each bucket/answer pairing. I thought I'd include it for anyone with that use-case:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CASE
        WHEN totalamount IS NULL THEN 'Unknown'
        WHEN totalamount &lt;= 100 THEN 'Not more than 100'
        WHEN totalamount &lt;= 200 THEN 'Not more than 200'
        ELSE 'Over 200'
    END ""Bucket"",
    COUNT(*) ""Number of results""
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY CASE
        WHEN totalamount IS NULL THEN 'Unknown'

        // Pad number as needed to achieve longer key length and seed more randomly.
        // NOTE I didn't want to make the code here available and it would take too longer to clean, so I'll tell you what I did. I basically took every number seed that was passed in and prefixed it and  postfixed it with some values to make it 16 characters long and to get a more unique result. For example:
        // if (number.Length = 15)
        //    number = ""Y"" + number;
        // if (number.Length = 14)
        //    number = ""7"" + number + ""z"";
        // etc - hey I already said this is a hack ;)

        // We pass in the current number as the password to an AES encryption of each of the
        // digits 0 - 9. This returns us a set of values that we can then sort and get a 
        // random order for the digits based on the current state of the number.
        Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt; prefixCipherResults = new Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;();
        for (int ndx = 0; ndx &lt; 10; ndx++)
            prefixCipherResults.Add(DoPrefixCipherEncrypt(ndx.ToString(), Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(number)), ndx);

        // Order the results and loop through to build your int array.
        List&lt;int&gt; group = new List&lt;int&gt;();
        foreach (string key in prefixCipherResults.Keys.OrderBy(k =&gt; k))
            group.Add(prefixCipherResults[key]);

        return group;
    }

<p>I need the ""DoPrefixCypherEncrypt"" converted/adjusted to AesManaged instead of RijdaelManaged.</p>

<p>Thanks guys</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
Thanks for all your answers:</p>

<p>I eventually found another way to do it using the available classes in WP 8.1.</p>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>        public static string DoPrefixCipherEncrypt(string strIn, byte[] btKey)
    {
        if (strIn.Length &lt; 1)
            return strIn;

        // Convert the input string to a byte array 
        byte[] btToEncrypt = System.Text.Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(strIn);

        AesManaged cryptoRijndael = new AesManaged();
        cryptoRijndael.Mode = CipherMode.ECB; cryptoRijndael.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7; //Mode Doesn't require Initialization Vector 

        // Create a key (No IV needed because we are using ECB mode) 
        ASCIIEncoding textConverter = new ASCIIEncoding();
        // Get an encryptor 
        ICryptoTransform ictEncryptor = cryptoRijndael.CreateEncryptor(btKey, null);
        // Encrypt the data... 
        MemoryStream msEncrypt = new MemoryStream();
        CryptoStream csEncrypt = new CryptoStream(msEncrypt, ictEncryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write);

        // Write all data to the crypto stream to encrypt it 
        csEncrypt.Write(btToEncrypt, 0, btToEncrypt.Length); csEncrypt.Close(); //flush, close, dispose 
        // Get the encrypted array of bytes 
        byte[] btEncrypted = msEncrypt.ToArray();

        // Convert the resulting encrypted byte array to string for return 
        return (Convert.ToBase64String(btEncrypted));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>which is compatible with non WinRT .NET.</p>

<p>I was able to use:</p>

<pre><code>    public static string DoPrefixCipherEncrypt(string strIn, byte[] btKey)
    {
        if (strIn.Length &lt; 1)
            return strIn;

        IBuffer plainBuffer = CryptographicBuffer.ConvertStringToBinary(strIn, BinaryStringEncoding.Utf16LE);
        IBuffer keyMaterial = CryptographicBuffer.CreateFromByteArray(btKey);

        SymmetricKeyAlgorithmProvider symProvider = SymmetricKeyAlgorithmProvider.OpenAlgorithm(SymmetricAlgorithmNames.AesEcbPkcs7);
        // create symmetric key from derived password key
        CryptographicKey symmKey = symProvider.CreateSymmetricKey(keyMaterial);

        var buffEncrypted = CryptographicEngine.Encrypt(symmKey, plainBuffer, null);
        var strEncrypted = CryptographicBuffer.EncodeToBase64String(buffEncrypted);

        return strEncrypted;
    }

<p>My problem is in resetting execution info after I get dump. If I do some actions on server and then call my ant target ""get_data"" twice,deleting test_data.exec file between the executions, I get the same coverege data. So it seems that reset=true doesn't work.</p>

<p>How can I make Jacoco to reset coverega data info after I dump it?
Would appreciate any help.</p>

<p>When keyboard shows up I can either reduce parent view height or slide it up so my controls are accessible. </p>

<p>That part works fine.</p>

<p>However I want to adjust tableview also, so I tried reducing its height (if I reduce the height of the parent view) or moving down the origin.y coordinate (if I slide parent view up).</p>

<p>Neither worked, i.e. tableView would not change to the new frame, it stays the same. Tableview only resizes if I do not manipulate parent view, i.e. if I adjust tableView frame alone. </p>

<p>Here is the methods for that:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)resizeTbl:(int)pnts{
CGRect tblframe = self.myTable.frame;
//tblframe.origin.y+=pnts;
tblframe.size.height-=pnts;
self.myTable.frame =tblframe;}


-(void )keyboardWillShow:(NSNotification *)notif{
int pnts=160;
CGRect frame = self.view.frame;
//frame.origin.y-=pnts;
frame.size.height-=pnts;
self.view.frame = frame;
[self resizeTbl:pnts];}
</code></pre>

<p>I probably could move all the controls up one by one and then table resize would work but I think there should be an easier way. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>Update/workaround:
Since table resize works alone just fine, I added one more observer - keyboardDidShow, and moved resize myTable from keyboardWilShow into there to take care of tableview after keyboard is up.</p>

<pre><code>-(void)keyboardDidShow:(NSNotification *)notif{
[self resizeTbl:160];}
</code></pre>

<p>So all the views come up as they are supposed to now. </p>

<p>However, when focus moves from one textbox to another with the keyboard already up, tableView resizes to its original frame by itself and I cannot catch when and how that does it. And then, when keyboard goes down tableView expands beyond its original frame, because I must have</p>

<pre><code>-(void)keyboardDidHide:(NSNotification *)notif{
[self resizeTbl:-160];}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when focus changes again tableView shrinks back to its normal frame and everything looks just fine. If I could somehow prevent those unwanted tableview resizes that mess things up.</p>

<p>If someone could makes sense out all of this I would be very appreciative.</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I got it. Autolayout was messing me up. I turned it off <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12688076/constraints-messing-me-up/12688256#12688256"">like that</a> and my logic now works, no glitches.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether this is possible because spring is plug gable as per my understanding so  when it is plug gable i should be able to do without a controller so that i don't need to change the controller when i need to use the same in to another application or vise versa.</p>

<p>from spring :</p>

<p><code>People use Spring Security for many reasons, but most are drawn to the project after finding the security features of J2EE's Servlet Specification or EJB Specification lack the depth required for typical enterprise application scenarios. Whilst mentioning these standards, it's important to recognise that they are not portable at a WAR or EAR level. Therefore, if you switch server environments, it is typically a lot of work to reconfigure your application's security in the new target environment. Using Spring Security overcomes these problems, and also brings you dozens of other useful, customisable security features.</code></p>

<p>I am not sure whether the points i have explained is true, please correct me if i am wrong.</p>

<p>Background info. I am trying to write a code that deals with dollar amounts,remark codes and a category to place each. There are 6 fields for dollar amounts 6 fields for remark codes and 7 categories. IF there is a remark code in the first field the dollar amount is in the first, if it is in the second the dollar amount is also in the second and so on. The 7 categories are based on a translation value of the remark code, which comes from another table. </p>

<p>The issue that I am having stems from the nature of how a case statement works. 
There is multiple cases where there is multiple remark codes.
The issue is when I have multiple remark codes with in the same category on one record. 
EX: remark code 1,2,3 and 4 all fit into category 1 and each remark code has a different value associated with it in the first 4 (1-4) dollar amount fields.</p>

<p>What happens in this case is the case statement evaluates the first true condition and exits. So when the first remark code is equal to a 1 it pulls that value and closes, rather than looking at all of the fields, which in this example, the first 4 remark codes are all 1's, which means that I need the code to pull the first 4 dollar amounts and place it in the correct category.</p>

<p>here is a piece of the code I am working with:</p>

<pre><code>CASE WHEN a.RMCGID = 1 THEN BOUAM1 
 WHEN b.RMCGID = 1 THEN BOUAM2 
 WHEN c.RMCGID = 1 THEN BOUAM3 
 WHEN d.RMCGID = 1 THEN BORCAM 
 WHEN e.RMCGID = 1 THEN BODSAM 
 WHEN f.RMCGID = 1 THEN BOBEAM
 WHEN g.RMCGID = 1 AND a.RMCGID IS NULL AND b.RMCGID IS NULL AND c.RMCGID IS NULL AND d.RMCGID IS NULL AND e.RMCGID IS NULL AND f.RMCGID IS NULL THEN BLAMTX  
 else 0 end as 'Discounts',
</code></pre>

<p>This is replicated 7 times, 0-6;</p>

<p>what I tried doing was adding a different section of code:</p>

<pre><code>**CASE WHEN a.RMCGID = 1 and b.RMCGID = 1 then BOUAM1+BOUAM2**
 WHEN a.RMCGID = 1 THEN BOUAM1 
 WHEN b.RMCGID = 1 THEN BOUAM2 
 WHEN c.RMCGID = 1 THEN BOUAM3 
 WHEN d.RMCGID = 1 THEN BORCAM 
 WHEN e.RMCGID = 1 THEN BODSAM 
 WHEN f.RMCGID = 1 THEN BOBEAM
 WHEN g.RMCGID = 1 AND a.RMCGID IS NULL AND b.RMCGID IS NULL AND c.RMCGID IS NULL AND d.RMCGID IS NULL AND e.RMCGID IS NULL AND f.RMCGID IS NULL THEN BLAMTX  
 else 0 end as 'Discounts',
</code></pre>

<p>Im thinking that a Case Statement is not the way to go BUT I am stuck so please if anyone has a suggestion I will gladly take it.</p>

<p>here is actual data.</p>

<pre><code>RMk1   Rmk2   Rmk3   Rmk4   Rmk5  Rmk6   AM1   AM2   AM3   AM4  AM5  AM6
PP      1A     JB     JL    NULL  NULL   11     75    21    18   0    0


C1  C2   C3   C4   C5   C6   C7
11  NULL NULL NULL NULL NULL NULL
</code></pre>

<p>The remark codes listed all translate to a 1(lookup from another table), and I am having them placed into the C1 column via the case statement, I want to see 125 not the first amount it finds. </p>

<p>There are cases where one row of data will have different remark codes that equal different column numbers, so I cannot just some all the dollar amounts.</p>

<pre><code>RMk1   Rmk2   Rmk3   Rmk4   Rmk5  Rmk6   AM1   AM2   AM3   AM4  AM5  AM6
B7      PP    NULL   NULL   NULL  NULL   175   75     0    0    0    0


C1  C2   C3   C4   C5   C6   C7
75  NULL NULL 175  NULL NULL NULL

<p>The documentation says that it uses an algorithm which is ""an extension of LJ"" and points to a long confusing paper about LJT. As best as I can tell, this is a big complicated system of highly formalised rules for figuring out which logical statements are true or false. But this doesn't even <em>begin</em> to explain how you turn a type signature into an executable expression. Presumably all the complicated formal reasoning is <em>involved</em> somehow, but the picture is crucially incomplete.</p>

<hr/>

<p>It's a bit like that time I tried to write a Pascal interpretter in BASIC. (Don't laugh! I was only twelve...) I spent hours trying to figure it out, and in the end I had to give up. I just couldn't figure out how the heck you get from a giant string containing an entire program, to something you can compare against known program fragments in order to decide what to actually do.</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is that you need to write a thing called a ""parser"". Once you comprehend what this is and what it does, suddenly everything becomes <em>obvious</em>. Oh, it's still not trivial to code it, but the <em>idea</em> is simple. You just have to write the actual code. If I'd known about parsers when I was twelve, then maybe I wouldn't have spent two hours just staring at a blank screen.</p>

<p>I suspect that what Djinn is doing is fundamentally simple, but I'm missing some important detail which explains how all this complicated logical gymnastics relates to Haskell source code...</p>

<p>For example, say five files need to be loaded, after which a UI component will become active.</p>

<p>If I set up a counter that increments each time a file is requested, then decrements each time one has loaded, I run the risk that the first two or three files may somehow get completely loaded before my code gets around to requesting the fourth and fifth, which would mean that my counter would be at zero when I still have two files to load, thus allowing the UI component to be prematurely activated.</p>

<p>There are some cases where you could know the number that need to be loaded before the requests go out, but it's possible that the first file contains the paths (and therefore the number of) files.  (And this file-loading scenario is only an example of the pattern I'm trying to explain.)</p>

Now the old application was version 1.0 and loading a depedency assembly A at version 2.1.1 The assembly is present in application local directory.
I am upgrading the new application to version 2.0 that will load assembly A version 1.0.1 which is present in its application local directory. I've checked application references using ISpy and confirmed the new application references A version 1.0.1</p>

<p>But when I start the new application (v 2.0), it is still trying to load assembly version 2.1.1 and failing. I checked the app.config, machine.config and GAC and there is no redirection for version of assembly A. I also checked fusion log files but don't see any redirection. All I see is the fusion log is that application prebinds A at version 2.1.1 and hence fails to set up the assembly present in its local directory.</p>

<p>Is there something I am missing here? What could be the possible reasons for application still referencing the older assembly at runtime?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Using some tools, I realized the the older assembly is being  referenced from a native DLL that is referenced by my application, but I don't know which third party DLL is that, and the application loads a ton of them. The fusion log confirms it by logging ""Calling assembly : (Unknown)."" for the missing assembly. </p>

<p>Now my next step is to find which dll is referencing the wrong assembly and fix that. Now the problem is that ILSpy tool doesn't show the native DLLs references, and DLLDepends tool does not show the assemblies references, so I am not able to link the two.</p>

<li>Is it possible to write all propositional formulas in Prolog?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Now I wish to connect my results with other propositional formulae. Suppose I have the following rule:</p>

<p><code>something :- formula(P, Q).</code></p>

<p>How does this connect? If I enter <code>formula(false, true)</code> (which evaluates to true) into the interpreter, this does not automatically make <code>something</code> true. Which is what I want.</p>

<p>To build a DLL, I specify the project properties to build a DLL, and then I but __declspec(dllexport) in front of any functions or members that I want to publically expose from the DLL.  Building the project will result in a DLL, a Lib, and a header file that can be deployed as say an API or something.</p>

<p>On the other end, to have your other compiled executable application dynamically link to the DLL  and use its functions, you simply need to have your executable project include the header files and link with the small lib file that was created when the DLL was built.  As long and the compiled application can find the DLL, everything will work.</p>

<p>That has been my experience and that is also how the Microsoft DLL building tutorial described everything on MSDN. I am wondering: is this standard practice? When would you ever need to use __declspec(dllimport) anywhere? Am I missing something?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

The query to the individual table correctly starts a T-SQL transaction and was on connection SPID 54
Then the query to the ContactUs table is made and EF does this on a different connection (SPID 53) which has the knock on effect of promoting the transaction to a DTC transaction.</strong></p>

<p><img src=""http://grab.by/2aLT"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>My question is how to get sorted Foo's efficiently.  Let's say that in one of my views, I have a sectioned table with every foo in it.  The sections are the categories.  Each section of foo (in a category) has an ordering.</p>

<p>Now, I am fetching them using this algorithm:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fetch a list of all categories, sorted by name</li>
<li>For each category, fetch the Sorted Foos, sorted by index ascending</li>
<li>For each SortedFoo, fetch the associated Foo, stick in an array</li>
<li>Take the Foos, now sorted by index in an array, and add this array to a 2D array</li>
<li>Return the 2D array as the ordered foo's in each alphabetized category.</li>
</ol>

<p>This seems soooooo inefficient to me. Surely there must be a better way to do this common type of fetch.  Can anybody suggest a new way to do this?</p>

In the beginning of the execution I open the connection and assign the cursor. This cursor is then sent to the methods which downloads the data and writes them to the database. So far I know the create_schema method is working since the database is created with the correct structure, the other methods seems to be failing, but in the script execute without raising errors. I've tried to go into the database using the sqlite3 termninal tool and select values from the tables, but also a select * returns an empty result. I'm not quite sure how the cursor works with methods, but hopefully posting it here will help me gain a better understanding. Thank in advance for your help. </p>

I take the originally received server data used to create dynamic forms, quickly clean up unnecessary keys using delete formData['not_needed'], and then I wanted to add the model that has been created before posting to the server, but when I check the data objects model key that I'm trying to add it is always an empty string.  I can either send one or the other, but can't seem to add one object to another as a key-value pair.</p>

<pre><code>// Abridged version
var formData = $scope.responseData; // original server data to build forms
delete formData['config_data']; // remove unnecessary keys

formData.model = $scope.formModel; // add model key

$http.post('/restful/api', formData).then(function(success) {...}, function(error) {...});
</code></pre>

<p>The output of passed data from the server looks like:</p>

<pre><code>{ id: ""1"", type: ""type_of_form"", name: ""name_of_package"", model: """" } // model always empty
</code></pre>

<p>Is this an issue using $scope?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Even when I hardcode the outgoing keys:</p>

<pre><code>var packageData = {
    ""packageid"": $scope.formData.id, // makes it to server
    ""desc"": $scope.formData.desc, // also makes it to server
    ""data"": $scope.formModel // is just an empty string
}
</code></pre>

<p>But formModel filled from some dumby form data when logged to console and printed out to the screen using a filter { formModel | json } looks like:</p>

<pre><code>formModel = {
  ""document_date"": ""1234"",
  ""first_name0"": ""1"",
  ""first_name1"": ""2"",
  ""first_name2"": ""3"",
  ""first_name3"": ""4""

<p>And this is the source code of the ViewController:</p>

<p>ViewController.h
    #import </p>

<pre><code>@interface ViewController : UIViewController
@property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIButton *loadxibButton;
@property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIView *middleView;
- (IBAction)buttonClicked:(id)sender;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>ViewController.m
    #import ""ViewController.h""</p>

<pre><code>@interface ViewController ()
@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
[super viewDidLoad];
}

- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning
{
[super didReceiveMemoryWarning];
}

- (IBAction)buttonClicked:(id)sender {
NSLog(@""click..."");
NSArray *nibObjects = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@""NewMiddleContent"" owner:self options:nil];
UIView *nibView = [nibObjects objectAtIndex:0];
self.middleView= nibView;
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>When I click on the button, nothing happens, i.e. the new view will not be displayed. Can anybody please help?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot
     Christian</p>

<p>Which yields ""SoapFault: looks like we got no XML document""
When I uncomment the location option I get ""SoapFault: Wrong Version""
When I view the wsdl file, I see the soap:address location set as</p>

<p>Which seems incorrect as it is the URL to the homepage, with the SID and a query param.</p>

<p>Magento version EE1.14
Things I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Disable local modules - no change </li>
<li>Using Zend_Soap_Client - no change</li>
<li>Various different URL configurations - tried everything under the<br>
sun, no change</li>
<li>Using SOAP v1 - same results</li>
<li>Tried using this on a remote instance instead of my local - same
result</li>
<li>Checked phpinfo - yes SOAP is installed</li>
<li>Tried debugging - When I turn on Xdebug and run my test script it
seems to prevent the script from even running. Browser just
indicates loading forever</li>
<li>Tried to uncomment line in .htaccess to rewrite <code>RewriteRule
^api/([a-z][0-9a-z_]+)/?$api.php?type=$1 [QSA,L]</code> - No change
(yes mod rewrite is on and working)</li>
<li>Tried fetching wsdl and saving locally and passing it into SOAP
client constructor - no change</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone know how to troubleshoot this? I see several threads with these errors, but either unanswered or have tried their solution and it did not work in this case. Why is my location in the wsdl incorrect? Any help at all would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>I want to save this as a EDI file. What should be its extension? And is there any link for steps or demo for using Talend to read this file and parse it to some readable file like <strong>CSV or XML</strong>?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

So I came up with the conclusion that I would simply have only one type of detail view that would change depending on the row in a table view  that the user selected.  However... I'm kind of struggling.  </p>

<p>The Setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>For the main settings view, I want it to be a grouped table view with multiple groups and rows.</li>
<li>For the settings detail view, I also want it to be a grouped table view with multiple groups and rows (that is where it gets confusing).</li>
</ul>

<p>I have seen simple things such as images and labels depend on the previous view, but not grouped table view structures. Is it possible to complete what I want without tons of views or 'if' statements? Any sort of help is apreciated.</p>

I understand that there are several levels that determine the level of guarantee that a write operation succeeded, with a performance trade-off for the higher you set this level. However, I am working in a C# environment, and I am trying to figure out how to use Write Concern there and what levels work best for certain situations. I already figured out how to collect the result of the check with a WriteConcernResult object, I am mainly interested in the levels themselves. </p>

<p>These are my questions:</p>

<p><strong>How do I set the Write Concern level in C# for specific writes?</strong> </p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17261589/c-sharp-mongodb-driver-write-concern"">This answer</a> suggests using the connection string, but this looks like a global setting, which I don't want, since some of the write operations I will be using are more ""important"" than others and I don't want to kill the performance. I noticed there's a <a href=""https://api.mongodb.org/csharp/current/"" rel=""nofollow"">WriteConcern class</a> but the documentation isn't very detailed about its use (it's under MongoDB.Driver Namespace in the documentation). </p>

<p>In particular, how do I set it to ""Journaled"" or ""Replica Acknowledged"", seeing as it's ""Acknowledged"" by default? </p>

<p><strong>What types of issues could get past the Write Concern check for each level?</strong></p>

<p>For example: system crashes, power failures, network connection issues, etc. I am especially interested in something sneaking by that is <strong>not easily detected</strong>, as power failures and the like are very noticeable and we could estimate the time interval where operations may have failed and react accordingly. </p>

I am deploying this app on an heroku server (there is a static node.js backend), and I also do this through git. When I push to heroku though, I am pushing an obfuscated (uglified) version of my code, so that the code is not easily copyable. I made a Makefile that allows me to script the uglification of my code, and I have my html test file that points to this. For development though, I have to switch back my test page to point to the source code. I am looking for the simplest solution to handle my source code and my production release in an efficient way. What are the various solutions to handle this? 2 git repository? One for source code, and one for the release? with a script that creates one from the other? Or is there a easier way to manage this?</p>

<p>I am trying to use <strong>accessible_by</strong> to determine a set of videos that are visible given a relationship between videos and channels, but the resulting SQL has the wrong table name for part of the query.  Here are the relationships:</p>

<pre><code># video.rb
class Video &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :channel
end

# channel.rb
class Channel &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :videos
  has_and_belongs_to_many :subchannels, :class_name =&gt; ""Channel"", :join_table =&gt; ""channels_channels"", :foreign_key =&gt; :parent_id, :association_foreign_key =&gt; :subchannel_id
  has_and_belongs_to_many :parent_channels, :class_name =&gt; ""Channel"", :join_table =&gt; ""channels_channels"", :foreign_key =&gt; :subchannel_id, :association_foreign_key =&gt; :parent_id
end

# The appropriate channels_channels table exists with subchannel_id and parent_id fields.
</code></pre>

<p>I need a <strong>cancan ability</strong> to find all public videos that are in public sub-channels of the default channel.  I tried the following:</p>

<pre><code># ability.rb
can :read, Video, :permission =&gt; 'public', :channel =&gt; {:permission =&gt; 'public', :parent_channels =&gt; {:name =&gt; ""Default""}}
</code></pre>

<p>In the console, when I try this out, I get the following:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; Video.accessible_by(Ability.new(nil))
SELECT ""videos"".* FROM ""videos"" INNER JOIN ""channels"" ON ""channels"".""id"" = ""videos"".""channel_id"" INNER JOIN ""channels_channels"" ON ""channels_channels"".""subchannel_id"" = ""channels"".""id"" INNER JOIN ""channels"" ""parent_channels_channels"" ON ""parent_channels_channels"".""id"" = ""channels_channels"".""parent_id"" WHERE ""videos"".""permission"" = 'public' AND ""channels"".""permission"" = 'public' AND ""channels"".""name"" = 'Default'
=&gt; [] 
</code></pre>

<p>I have some records in place that should result in a video, and, more to the point, would have expected the end of the query to have <strong>""parent_channels_channels"".""name"" = 'Default'</strong>, but the table is <strong>""channels""</strong> in stead, resulting in the wrong dataset since the SQL is referencing the name of the channel, not the parent channel.</p>

<p>I tried changing the ability as follows to force the table name:</p>

<pre><code>    can :read, Video, :permission =&gt; 'public', :channel =&gt; {:permission =&gt; 'public', :parent_channels =&gt; {""parent_channels_channels.name"" =&gt; ""Default""}}
</code></pre>

<p>That results in the correct query, and <strong>accessible_by</strong> returns the right dataset, but then <strong>can?(:read, video)</strong> for a video in that result set results in a runtime error.</p>

<pre><code>NoMethodError: undefined method `parent_channels_channels.name' for #&lt;Channel:0x007fef35593748&gt;

<p>This app works fine and I get the profile data. However when I tried creating a another Android project called <code>AndroidPlusExample</code> with the same package as mentioned above and the same code I am not able to get the profile data.</p>

<p>In the Google API console I have the client ID created with the above package name but the app works in the first project and not in the second project.</p>

<p>Why is this happening? I do not get any error messages in Logcat. It's just that the profile info is not fetched in the second project.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong>: I'm trying to do the right thing here. I added CORS functionality to my REST Service (ASP.NET Web-API) relying on the Thinktecture Identitymodel CORS DelegatingHandler. So far so good.</p>

<p><strong>To actually test if it is working I did the following:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I set up a simple HTML page and published it on a different host than the rest service (<em>xttp://otherhost/simplewebpage</em>). The page uses JQuery to make the sample request. Code see below.</li>
<li>Next I set up my rest service to not use iis express but rather the fully blown instance of it running on my development machine (<em>xttp://developmenthost/restservice</em>).</li>
<li>Last but not least on my development machine I open up the xttp://otherhost/simplewebpage and fire the Ajax request. The error callback is executed telling me there was a ""transport error"" (IE9) or """" (empty string) in Chrome. I made sure there's no proxy related connectivity issue or anything like that.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I went forth and looked at the Fiddler traces and IIS logs.
Fiddler says there is no GET /rest/hello request but rather a OPTIONS /rest/hello request - which is totally fine and expected! However the response to the OPTIONS request is rather intriguing!</p>

<p><em><strong>The whole response header looks like this:</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Allow: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, POST
Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
Public: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, POST
Date: Fri, 15 Feb 2013 14:09:27 GMT
Content-Length: 0
</code></pre>

<p>This is of course nowhere even close to the expected response. <strong>The fun part about this is, that the Request didn't even hit Application_BeginRequest() in my application.</strong> So there's no way my application could be responsible for that result. I can see the request in my IIS logs and IIS adds the Powered-by-ASP.NET header.. so it definitely passes through (the right) IIS site.</p>

<p><em><strong>The JQuery code that triggers the ajax request:</em></strong>
    </p>

<pre><code>    function Run()
    {
        $.ajax({
            type: 'GET',
            url: url,
            dataType: ""json"",
            beforeSend: function(jqXhr) {
                jqXhr.setRequestHeader(""Authorization"", ""Basic "" + getBasicHttpEncodedString(userName, password));
                jqXhr.setRequestHeader(""Api-Key"", ""123"");
            },
            success: successCallback,
            error: errorCallback,
            timeout: 180*1000
        });
    }
</code></pre>

<p><em><strong>The resulting OPTIONS request looks like that:</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>OPTIONS http://services.dev13/Rest/Hello HTTP/1.1
Host: developmenthost
Connection: keep-alive
Access-Control-Request-Method: GET
Origin: http://otherhost/simplewebpage
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/24.0.1312.57 Safari/537.17

Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3
</code></pre>

<p>... and you have already seen the response to that above.</p>

<p>Any idea who exactly answers my OPTIONS request? Or is my JQuery code flawed?
The REST Service works just fine if I use for example Postman (Google Chrome App) or if I forge Requests in Fiddler (That's probably because they don't do CORS negotiation - there's no OPTIONS request).</p>

<p><em><strong>Update #1:</em></strong> Earlier today I read somewhere that disabling WebDAV is mandatory because it interferes with OPTIONS requests. My IIS Role Services view tells me WebDAV Publishing is <em>Not installed</em>.</p>

<p><strong>* Update #2:*</strong> Problem solved?? I dug deeper. There's a module registered in IIS that is responsible for the ""undesired(?)"" response to the OPTIONS request. Its name is ""OPTIONSVerbHandler"" (handler: ProtocolSupportModule). If I disable that module the request passes through to my application. There a more meaningful response is created and then <em>followed by the actual GET request!</em> <strong><em>YAY!</em></strong></p>

<p>The confusing part for me is that right before this, we have a script call to machine A from machine B that works just fine. (this is being done from a powershell script if that's of relevance).</p>

<p>This is the first call (that works)</p>

<pre><code>&amp; psexec \\$computer_name -u ""&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;user&gt;"" -p ""&lt;pass&gt;"" -w ""&lt;folder&gt;"" ""&lt;program1&gt;"" 2

<p>This is the second call (executed directly after the first)</p>

<pre><code>&amp; psexec \\$computer_name -u ""&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;user&gt;"" -p ""&lt;pass&gt;"" -w ""&lt;folder&gt;"" ""&lt;program1&gt;"" 1
</code></pre>

<p>When I take just that part of the script and run it from another machine (machine C pointing to machine A), I can get it to work, which makes me think it's unlikely that the two are interfering with each other. I've looked for a way to disconnect psexec from a computer, but I didn't find anything, so I'm not sure if there's a way.</p>

<p>I found an answer on superuser suggesting that it could be limited by sessions <a href=""http://superuser.com/questions/200938/psexec-the-handle-is-invalid"">http://superuser.com/questions/200938/psexec-the-handle-is-invalid</a>, but I checked and found that there is only one connection active.</p>

But I was not seeing any session files created there. So I set the session.save_path to /tmp in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini and created a test.php with just start_session().

I work with Java, but don't want to develop using JSP/JSF/Servlet...
Reading about Scala raised again my interest in Studying web technologies to build my project.</p>

<p>To be honest, I never worked with javascript frameworks and therefore json.</p>

<p>I went through a long list of Scala web frameworks (mainly Lift, Scalatra, Bowler, Scalate, Play!....) and then I realized I would need some javascript technology to build the pages.
Frankly, I don't know if I am willing to build from scratch components, when I could simply use something like Extjs, so I decided to search for javascript frameworks.</p>

<p>So, I went down one level in the search tree (Scala -> [web framework] -> [javascript framework]) and realized I am screwed.</p>

<p>I need to choose something to learn, and I would like to choose something useful, even if has commercial license like Extjs.</p>

<p>When I decided to study Lift, I could see some problems in Lift+Extjs integration, mainly because they don't provide this integration, and suggest you to implement your own (don't know how much work this would be).</p>

<p>Then I read about Lift + Cappuccino, but instantly cried blood after realizing the learning curve of Scala + Lift + Cappuccino... but if it really worths, I could do it...</p>

<p>So, my question is, what are the possible good combinations of Scala web frameworks and javascript frameworks?</p>

<p>I am really stuck in this question, and fed up of simply searching about frameworks just trying to guess which is the best and more flexible so I wont waste my time with future huge achitectural problems.</p>

<p>ps: one of my main concern about the javascript framework is the components. For instance, I need a good tree implementation, but I couldn't build one myselft (I could see there is tree components in Extjs, Cappuccino, jQuery and others....).</p>

<p>ps2: thank you for the suggestions! Question closed :-(</p>

<p>Before trying to implement the <code>timeout</code>, everything works fine, my <code>recvfrom()</code> was in block mode. So I think the problem come from this code that I add. Maybe it's a parameter of a function that I don't understand well.</p>
