"13417200","1","","","2012-11-16 13:03:29","","0","408","<p>I'm trying to add a custom formatter to a Dojo DataGrid. This formatter is as far as I understand supposed to return a string with html for presentation.</p>

<p>I want to render a link with a js callback when clicked, i.e </p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""javascript:void(0)"" onclick=""callMeBack()""&gt;value&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I don't want to have a global function <code>callMeBack()</code>, but rather write the callback function inline. But I can't seem to get this to function. So far I wrote this:</p>

<pre><code> function callMeBack() { ... }
 var structure = [
            {name:""name"", field:""name"", width: ""200px"", formatter: function(name) {
                var link = domConstruct.create(""a"", {innerHTML: name});
                domAttr.set(link, ""href"", ""javascript:void(0)"");
                on(link, ""click"", callMeBack);
                return link.outerHTML;
            }},
            ....                
        ];   
</code></pre>

<p>The problem seems to be that the click callback doesn't get registered. Quite understandable considering that the DOM node used in the grid will probably be constructed after the string representation is returned.</p>

<p>But how can I make this work?</p>

"30776120","1","","","2015-06-11 08:57:27","","0","34","<p>I have these tables:</p>

<pre><code>Config
ID
TYPE - number (possible values 0,1,2)

Block
CONFIG_ID

Apartment
CONFIG_ID
BLOCK_ID

Room
CONFIG_ID
APARTMENT_ID
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the config for Apartment and Room <strong>can be inherited</strong> from the parent.</p>

<p><strong>Inheritance logic:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If for Room the CONFIG_ID is null it means we use the value from Apartment, but if Apartment also inherits we use the value from Block.</li>
<li><p>Also if Room have a CONFIG_ID BUT only one config field is NULL, it also means that only that field is inherited. (so for example Room has a config_id = 4, and the TYPE in config 4 is NULL, it means the type is inherited)</p>

<p>Example:
Room ""Kitchen"" has CONFIG_ID = NULL 
Apartment ""VIP Apartment"" has a CONFIG_ID != NULL with TYPE = 2
So the Kitchen TYPE is NULL which means the actual value is 2 (inherited from Apartment)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What I want is a <strong>SQL query</strong> to search Rooms by their TYPE <strong>(even if its null so inherited)</strong>.</p>

<p>So if I search for TYPE = 2 the Room 'Kitchen' above should be found, because it inherits from Apartment.  </p>

<p>I can't really figure this out. I tried with 3 joins on each Block/Apartment/Room but the Config I need can come from different table everytime. And I don't know how to conditionally join the config on each table. </p>

<p>Pseudocode for the query:</p>

<pre><code> (room.config.TYPE is Xx or (room.config.type is null and (apartment.config.type = Xx or (apartment.config.type is null and block.config.type = Xx))))

Block 
id=1, name='Block1', config_id = NULL
Apartment 
id=1, name='Apartment1', block_id=1, config_id = 1 
Room
id=1, name='Room1-inherited', apartment_id = 1, config_id = NULL 
id=2, name='Room2-actual', apartment_id = 1, config_id = 2

Config
id=1, type=2 // apartment's config
id=2, type=2 // room2's config

<p>Expected result when search for Rooms with type 2:</p>

<pre><code>Both Room1 (inherited type 2 from Apartment)
 and Room2 (actual type in its own config)

<p>I recently had a product filter developed for an eCommerce site. It's working fine, however, the setup involves the products that have been 'filtered out' being sent out of view at the bottom of the site.
Whilst they are out of view to the customer, the browser still allocates space for them at the bottom, hence my site now scrolls well past the footer.</p>

<p>My Question is;
Is it possible to lock off scrolling at a certain part of a page using jQuery or CSS?</p>

<p>eg; stop scrolling at base of footer. Or slot in an Div with an ID at the bottom of the page and spec no scrolling past that?</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

<p>how far i have understood the cross validation process, the <code>svm_cross_validation()</code> method should give me the optimised values of parameters. Where <code>svm_cross_validation()</code> method doesn't return any value, instead it sets the target class labels of training data in one of the arguments. </p>

<p>Now I am totally confused about how to get the best values of parameters for kernel functions. It would be a great help if someone can elaborate the process of getting the best suitable parameter values performing cross validation with LibSVM's Java library. </p>

Should the parameters be passed as a query string, and if so, what to do when all the parameters aren't specified or are formatted incorrectly? </p>

<p> For example, lets say i have a Post resource, which can be accessed by `api/posts` endpoint. Each post has a geographical location, and posts can be retrieved ONLY when specifying an area that the posts may reside in. Thus, 3 parameters are required: latitude, longitude and radius.</p>

<p>I can think of 2 options in this case:<br/>
1. Putting the parameters in query string: <code>api/posts/?lat=5.54158&amp;lng=71.5486&amp;radius=10</code><br/>
2. Putting the parameters in the URL: <code>api/posts/lat/5.54158/lng/71.5486/radius/10</code></p>

<p>Which of these would be the correct approach? It seems wrong to put required parameters in the query string, but the latter approach feels somewhat 'uglier'.  </p>

<p>PS. I'm aware there are many discussion on this topic already (for example: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4024271/rest-api-best-practices-where-to-put-parameters"">REST API Best practices: Where to put parameters?</a>), but my question is specifically addressed to the case when parameters are required, not optional.  </p>

I would like each cell to have its own navigation controller that operates within the cell. When I associate a navigation controller with a cell (via edit/embed in/navigation controller) I get a situation where a segue from a table cell results in the entire tableview being replaced rather than the cell view. Is there a way (ideally via storyboards) that in merely replace the view controller within the cell. It is not a hard requirement that the table be static.
Thanks.</p>

There are any other Git plugins for those IDEs?</p>

<p>I am new to C++. In this code, if I gave an input which is not valid (space, tab, letter, etc) this code suddenly become an infinite loop. I need to ignore such invalid inputs, display a message, and come back to the starting position. How can I do that? Please help!</p>

<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZXXEa.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The MasterViewController class is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>@interface MasterViewController : UIViewController &lt;UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource, UISearchBarDelegate&gt;

@property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet UISearchBar *searchBar; // Not pictured above
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSMutableArray *displayData;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSMutableArray *auditedData;

@property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet UITableView *tableView; // Each of the tabs contains a tableview
@property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet UITextField *itemCounter;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>and is initialized as follows:</p>

<pre><code>MasterViewController *blahMasterController = (MasterViewController *)tabItem;
blahController.displayData = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
blahController.delegate = detailTableViewController;
blahDetailController.recallDelegate = blahController;
</code></pre>

<p>Functionality is such that when a user selects a table row in one of the tabs, the relevant data is displayed in the detail view controller.  Then, when the user taps a button on the detail view controller, the entry in the master view tab is removed.</p>

<p>The former works well...the later is behaving strangely.  Here is my ""respondToDetailViewButton"" method in the MasterViewController (the method delegated to by the detail controller):</p>

<pre><code>- (void)respondToDetailViewButton
{
    NSLog(@""Class: %@: %@"", [self class], self);
    NSLog(@""TableView: %@"", self.displayMachinesTableView);
    NSLog(@""Search Bar:%@"", self.searchBar);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and its output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Class: MasterViewController: /MasterViewController: 0x105b10a0/<br>
  TableView: /UITableView: 0xe960c00; frame = (0 0; 320 395);
  clipsToBounds = YES; autoresize = TM+BM; tag = 1; gestureRecognizers =
  ; layer = /CALayer: 0x114b9950/; contentOffset:
  {0, 0}/<br> Search Bar: (null)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the above you can see that when the detail controller delegates back to its master, the searchBar reference, despite being strongly attributed, becomes null despite the references to MasterViewController's tableView remaining intact.</p>

<p>And the searchBar is verifiably non-nil at some point because in the MasterViewController object, the following call in didSelectRowAtIndexPath:</p>

<pre><code>currentScope = [searchBar.scopeButtonTitles objectAtIndex:searchBar.selectedScopeButtonIndex];
NSLog(@""%@"", currentScope);
</code></pre>

<p>renders ""New"" or ""Old"" or ""Blah"" depending on the scope I have selected.</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea as to why the searchBar reference becomes null based on what I have provided? Many thanks in advance!!</p>

<p>I've read many of the other threads here about managing COM references while using the .Net-Excel interop to make sure the Excel process exits correctly upon exit, and so far the techniques have been working very well, but I recently came across a problem when adding new worksheets to an existing workbook file.</p>

<p>The code below leaves a zombie Excel process. </p>

<p>If I add a worksheet to a newly created workbook file, it exits fine.  If I run the code excluding the <code>.Add()</code> line, it exits fine.  (The existing file I'm reading from is an empty file created by the commented out code)</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<pre><code>//using Excel = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel;
//using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
public static void AddTest()
{
  string filename = @""C:\addtest.xls"";
  object m = Type.Missing;
  Excel.Application excelapp = new Excel.Application();
  if (excelapp == null) throw new Exception(""Can't start Excel"");
  Excel.Workbooks wbs = excelapp.Workbooks;

  //if I create a new file and then add a worksheet,
  //it will exit normally (i.e. if you uncomment the next two lines
  //and comment out the .Open() line below):
  //Excel.Workbook wb = wbs.Add(Excel.XlWBATemplate.xlWBATWorksheet);
  //wb.SaveAs(filename, m, m, m, m, m, 
  //          Excel.XlSaveAsAccessMode.xlExclusive,
  //          m, m, m, m, m);

  //but if I open an existing file and add a worksheet,
  //it won't exit (leaves zombie excel processes)
  Excel.Workbook wb = wbs.Open(filename,
                               m, m, m, m, m, m,
                               Excel.XlPlatform.xlWindows,
                               m, m, m, m, m, m, m);

  Excel.Sheets sheets = wb.Worksheets;

  //This is the offending line:
  Excel.Worksheet wsnew = sheets.Add(m, m, m, m) as Excel.Worksheet; 

  //N.B. it doesn't help if I try specifying the parameters in Add() above

  wb.Save();
  wb.Close(m, m, m);

  //overkill to do GC so many times, but shows that doesn't fix it

<p>The question is: how to make <strong>this script more efficient</strong>?</p>

<p>Currently the script becomes active the moment a user places the mouse over (hover) a certain HTML5 section-tag with an ID. At this moment the script removes the existing class named 'noDisplay' from a subordinate nav-tag containing a submenu list, hence content becomes visible to the user. This submenu list may be three to four levels deep. The submenus are held in classes (subMenu1, subMenu2, subMenu3, subMenu4, etc.). 
The script is written to serve individually each of the given section IDs and its sublevel classes.</p>

<p>Basically the script interacts with the DOM by removing the class 'noDisplay' upon mouse hover and restores the same class upon mouse leave.
(Tried to give a clear explanation. If not please ask.)</p>

<p>Here is a JSfiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/snahl/3epRN/"" rel=""nofollow"">enter link description here</a></p>

<p>I hope someone can suggest a way to do this much more efficiently.
Possibly with more sections (#ID's) and subMenu-levels (a class per level).</p>

<p>Using the <strong>CSS properties 'display: none;' and 'display:block;'</strong> would be the simplest solution but this is <strong>not desired</strong> because a search-bot my decide to skip content flagged as invisible to the user or a screenreader. The class 'NoDisplay' in use here keeps content invisible to users and keeps its readability to screen readers (and thus to most of the search bots).</p>

<p>So basically the script function remains as is to <strong>remove and add the class 'noDisplay' upon hover</strong>.
The goal is to obtain a <strong>script that is more efficient</strong> that could use for instance variables for each section, instead of writing code for each new section and hence extending the current script. </p>

<p><strong>Where it occurs</strong><br>
I'm making a DB query to get all tracks within a subfolder and then I check if the file is in that particular folder and not in a subfolder with a regex. This is the code:  </p>

<pre><code>public static final String DATA = MediaStore.Audio.Media.DATA;

public static void getTracksFromFolderWithoutSubfolder(
        Context context, File f, ArrayList&lt;TrackInfo&gt; q, 
        int icon) {

    String pattern = Pattern.quote(f.getAbsolutePath().toLowerCase()) + ""/[^/]*"";
    Cursor mCursor = null;

    String selection = MediaStore.Audio.Media.IS_MUSIC + "" != 0 AND "" + DATA + "" LIKE \"""" + f.getAbsolutePath() + ""/%\"""";
    Uri contentUri = Media.getContentUriForPath(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath());
    String projection[] = new String[]{DATA};

    mCursor = context.getContentResolver().query(contentUri, projection, selection, null, DATA);

    String data, fileName[];
    while(mCursor.moveToNext()){

        data = mCursor.getString(0);    
        if(data.toLowerCase().matches(pattern)){ // this is the line the logcat refers to
            fileName = data.split(""/"");
            q.add(new TrackInfo(fileName[fileName.length-1], null, data, null, -1, icon, false));
        }


    }

    mCursor.close();

}
</code></pre>

<p>The error only seems to occur if I call this method with the <code>File f</code> as the main folder for music on my device (about 1200 music files including subfolders). But it does not occur every time. In fact, it occurs about two or three times in ten calls.  </p>

<p>Can anybody tell me where this might come from? Maybe I'm missing to release some resources or something like that..<br>
I'm currently working with a Moto G, Android 4.4  </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>This works fine if the user chooses to authenticate directly through foursquare, or sign up through foursquare.  However, the foursquare OAuth page gives the user the option of logging in/signing up via Facebook. If selected, the initial Facebook login screen displays correctly; the user can enter a username/password and select the 'log in' button; then the window goes blank.  It appears control is being passed off to Facebook's popup prompting for permissions to be granted.  However, the WebAuthenticationBroker is not displaying this.  For all intents and purposes, WebAuthenticationBroker is hung.</p>

<p>I have removed the bodies of the targets to save space and because they are irrelevant. However, if someone thinks they are, I will include them.</p>

<p>Anyway, as one can see, there is one target - <code>KillServerHosts</code>, which I wish to invoke twice and for a good reason. Once before the build, in order to ensure no assemblies are locked and the other time after the tests complete to ""cleanup the table"".</p>

<p>Naturally, trying to invoke the target <code>KillServerHosts</code> twice does not work, MSBuild refuses to build the same target twice. So, I am trying to cheat by invoking the target <code>KillServerHosts2</code>. The problem is that sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.</p>

<p>If I run the <code>KillServerHosts</code> target from the command line it always kills the relevant server hosts, so from this respect it works fine.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I am trying to create a straight forward app. 
It will be using EF 6.1.0 as the DAL. </p>

<p>I have an entity called User.
I have another entity called WorkItem</p>

<p>a user can have many WorkItems.</p>

<p>I have created a EFDbContext called ""TimesheetsContext"". It inherits from DbContext and has 2 virtual properties:</p>

<pre><code>    public virtual IDbSet&lt;WorkItem&gt; WorkItems { get; set; }

    public virtual IDbSet&lt;User&gt; Users { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>I also have an IUnitOfWork (and its concrete class) </p>

<pre><code>public interface IUnitOfWork
{
    ITimeSheetContext Context { get; set; }
    IWorkItemRepository WorkItemRepository { get; set;  }
    IUserRepository UserRepository { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The WorkItem and User repository simply has functions such as Add, Login, Update, which in turn calls the EfDBContext to perform the request operation.</p>

<p>Now, I want to create a unit test to be able to mock up the DbContext and be able to add users or work items. However, I cannot seem to get it to work.</p>

<p>Once, with your help, I have got this far, I can then easily change it to use a services layer and pass in an IUnitOfWork.</p>

        this._mockContext = new Mock&lt;TimeSheetContext&gt;();
        var taskDbSetMock = new Mock&lt;IDbSet&lt;WorkItem&gt;&gt;();
        var userDbSetMock = new Mock&lt;IDbSet&lt;User&gt;&gt;();

        this._mockContext.Object.Users.Add(u);

        Assert.AreEqual(4, this._mockContext.Object.Users.Count());

<p>It seems like the file is created and suddenly destroyed. I´m wondering why. </p>

<p>If I try to run pgpool from pgPoolAdmin I got this error: pgpool start failed. pgpool.pid not found.</p>

<p>Like other times, it´s maybe and stupid issue and I´m not being able to solve it as i don´t have a high level of knowledge on those systems.</p>

<p>Any idea about what to try?</p>

<p>Given the following string, I want to 'cut' it to the left of every ""D"" such that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I get a <strong>List</strong> of fragments (with sequence unchanged)</p></li>
<li><p><code>StringJoin</code>@fragments gives back the original string (but is does not matter if I have to reorder the fragments to obtain this). That is, sequence within each fragment is important, and I do not want to lose any characters.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(The example I am interested in is a protein sequence (string) where each character represents an amino acid in one-letter code.  I want to obtain the theoretical list of ALL fragments obtained by treating with an enzyme known to split before ""D"")</p>

<pre><code>str = ""MTPDKPSQYDKIEAELQDICNDVLELLDSKGDYFRYLSEVASGDN""
</code></pre>

<p>The best I can come up with is to insert a space before each ""D"" using <code>StringReplace</code> and then use <code>StringSplit</code>.  This seems quite awkward, to say the least. </p>

<pre><code>frags1 = StringSplit@StringReplace[str, ""D"" -&gt; "" D""]
</code></pre>

<p>giving as output:</p>

<pre><code>{""MTP"", ""DKPSQY"", ""DKIEAELQ"", ""DICN"", ""DVLELL"", ""DSKG"", ""DYFRYLSEVASG"", ""DN""}
</code></pre>

<p>or, alternatively, using <code>StringReplacePart</code>:</p>

<pre><code>frags1alt = 
 StringSplit@StringReplacePart[str, "" D"", StringPosition[str, ""D""]]
</code></pre>

<p>Finally (and more realistically), if I want to split before ""D"" provided that the residue immediately preceding it is not ""P"" [ie P-D,(Pro-Asp) bonds are not cleaved], I do it as follows:</p>

<pre><code>StringSplit@StringReplace[str, (x_ /; x != ""P"") ~~ ""D"" -&gt; x ~~ "" D""]
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a more elegant way? </p>

<p>Speed is not necessarily an issue.  I am unlikely to be dealing with strings of greater than, say, 500 characters. I am using Mma 7.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I have added the bioinformatics tag, and I thought it might be of interest to add an example from that field.</p>

<p>The following imports a protein sequence (Bovine serum albumin, accession number 3336842) from the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/"" rel=""nofollow"">NCBI database</a> using <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/nbk25500/"" rel=""nofollow"">eutils</a> and then generates a (theoretical) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypsin"" rel=""nofollow"">trypsin</a> digest.  I have assumed that the enzyme tripsin cleaves between residues A1-A2 when  A1 is either ""R"" or ""K"", provided that A2 is not ""R"", ""K"" or ""P"".  If anyone has any suggestions for improvements, please feel free to suggest modifications.</p>

<p>Using a modification of sakra's method ( a carriage return after '?db=' possibly needs to be removed):</p>

<pre><code>StringJoin /@

<p>I'm building my first Django webapp, which is supposed to be an application to manage payrolls for employees (this is going to be something internal for my work place). I do this mostly to learn Django, but also to build something useful.</p>

<p>My question is about saving some historic data, but retrieving always only the current most recent data for each employee. I'll provide an example, and hopefully it will be easier for me to explain.</p>

<p>Let's say we have 2 models (and I really do have a similar implementation of those models):</p>

<pre><code>class Employee(models.Model):
    id = models.IntegerField(primary_key=True)
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)

    address = &lt;not implemented yet&gt;


class EmployeeAddress(models.Model):
    id = models.IntegerField(primary_key=True)
    employee = models.ForeignKey('Employee')
    city = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    street = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    house = models.IntegerField()
    start_date = models.DateField()
</code></pre>

<p>I would like that when I retrieve the field <code>address</code> from an <code>Employee</code> instance, I will get only the most recent address of that employee. Note that the <code>EmployeeAddress</code> table saves all address changes for each employee. In most cases I only need the most recent address, and I would like to retrieve it from the employee instance directly. Now, I could solve this by setting the <code>address</code> field to be:</p>

<pre><code> address = models.OneToOneField('EmployeeAddress')
</code></pre>

<p>and make sure I update it to point to the most recent record in the <code>EmployeeAddress</code> table each time add a new address.</p>

<p>But a more interesting case is shown in the following example:</p>

<p>Say I have another model:</p>

<pre><code>class EmployeePhone(models.Model):
    id = models.IntegerField(primary_key=True)
    employee = models.ForeignKey('Employee')
    number = models.IntegerField()
    start_date = models.DateField()
    end_date = models.DateField()
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in this case, each employee may have several (active) phone records (these might be home phone, work phone, cellular phone, etc...).
In this case I would like to add a new field to <code>Employee</code> which will be called: <code>phone_number</code>, and make sure that whenever this field is accessed I will get a list of only the active phone records for that employee. Instead of querying explicitly the <code>EmployeePhone</code> backwards from <code>Employee</code> and then filtering by the records which have a missing <code>end_date</code> each time I want to access the phone numbers, I would like an easy access to those records from the field of the employee itself.</p>

<p>If the phone numbers tables would not have saved history (meaning all records were active, and once a record is not longer valid, we just remove it), It was very simple, I could get all the phone records by iterating over <code>Employee.employeephone_set</code> - these were all the valid phone numbers for that employee. But since we have history, this is no longer valid option for me, and I need to add additional query (filter) on <code>Employee.employeephone_set</code> to retrieve only the most recent active phone numbers.</p>

<p>There are many more examples, like bank accounts history table (similar to the address example), and office titles for each employee (which could be several for each employee), and many more.</p>

<p>Now, there is a way I could think of, to solve my problem and that is to implement a property in Employee that queries and filters the phone table automatically whenever the get method for that property is invoked. But I would like to hear other solutions to my (not so hard) problem.</p>

<p>I probably made the problem look like a big deal by this long post, but actually it isn't.. I'm just thinking maybe I'm missing something.. maybe Django actually supports what I want to accomplish somehow.</p>

<p>I would usually add an onClick event tag to track it (you can see examples of this in the HTML below), but in this case, it wouldn't work because the navigation arrows don't change at all, so I'm not sure how to tie the specific slide the person is viewing to their click action.</p>

<p>I've looked on SO and the internet and can't find any ideas on how to achieve this. The only thing I can think of is to reprogram the slider so all the content changes, including the navigation arrows so I can assign a unique click event to the arrow tied to the slide showing when it is clicked.  I don't think the slideshow would be as slick this way though and I would like to keep it as is.  I would also like to keep all the slides on one URL so the whole site doesn't reload with each click.</p>

<p>Basically, I think I want to write a kernel driver that expose a new sound output device to the OS. If there's a way to write the driver so that I only have to deal with a simple sample buffer input to process it would be great (the simpler the better). I don't care too much about latency, I just want it to be as transparent as possible for the system and the applications running so that everything goes through this virtual device out of the box.</p>

<p>I have some experience in Linux kernel development but I know next to nothing about Windows driver development. I have a genuine Visual Studio 2013 ultimate and I want to target Windows 7 (above would be nice but it <em>has</em> to work on W7).</p>

<p>I would like to know which API/framework/system should I use to achieve my goal and possibly link to dev ressources to get me started.</p>

<p>The problem is, if the bottom padding is set to 10px Firefox renders it as overshooting the li, and the other browsers have no issues, but if it's changed to 9px, Firefox likes it and shows it nicely, but the rest of the browser crowd render the padding as 'too-short'.</p>

<p>Here's the jsfiddle (I've commented the critical line so you can change it between 9/10px and see the difference): <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/NaxUj/7/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/NaxUj/7/</a></p>

<p>Any ideas for what causes this and how it can be fixed? </p>

<p>Simple description of situation: I am attempting to create a python script that opens an executable for a simple C++ program with an unknown number of inputs in a windows environment, sends some data into that program, and then check to see if it has crashed / rinse and repeat.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> This is a pipes question. Bear with me, I am still learning about pipes, so I may have a misunderstanding of exactly how they work. Forgive me if I do. Is it possible to detect how many inputs a program has? Basically what I'm attempting to do is open an executable using my python script, that I personally know nothing about, and send in garbage data into each available input. If it is NOT possible to detect how many inputs there are: would there be an adverse reaction (like crashing the program Im sending the data into) if I send more arguments into it than there are inputs? As in the C++ program takes 3 inputs and I send in 6 arguments?</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Does anyone know if it possible using a python script to detect whether a program has hung or not? So far the best information on this I've been able to find is simply detecting whether the program is running or not via FindWindow, and then I suppose I could monitor the CPU usage to see if it continues to rise... but that is hardly an ideal method (and may not even work properly!) If there are any better known methods out there I would be thrilled!</p>

<p>now, I don't believe the backend has anything to do with this, since the problem with IE8 tabbing is known:</p>

<p><code>press on any field of a webpage and press tab all the way, the focus goes back up to the url input and buttons and doesn't return to the document after repeating it, if you click on an element in a website it re-adds the focus to that element, but when you press tab again it goes back to the top of the browser.</code></p>

<p>Now, my problem happens AFTER tabbing all the way and getting the focus out of the document.
It would seem the browser is removing events from the DOM, I have debugged the code on IE8 and it seems to not trigger the callback function, while it behaves normally when not doing the whole tab thing.</p>

<p>I've tried using <code>dojo.disconnect()</code> and re-adding the events by subsequently calling <code>dojo.connect()</code> to no avail, here's a small snippet:</p>

<pre><code>var connectedObjects = {};
dojo.query("".someClass"").forEach(function(inputField){
   connectedObjects[inputField.id] = {}; 
   connectedObjects[inputField.id].onfocus = dojo.connect(inputField, ""onfocus"", function(event){

           dojo.disconnect(connectedObjects[inputField.id].onkeyup);
           connectedObjects[inputField.id].onkeyup = dojo.connect(inputField, ""onkeyup"", someCallbackFunction);
       }
   })
});

<p>Trying to use RgoogleMaps, I copied the following example for Canada:</p>

<pre><code>library(RgoogleMaps)

  lat=c(48,64) 
  lon=c(-140,-110) 
  center=c(mean(lat), mean(lon))
  zoom=5
  terrmap=GetMap(
  center=center,
  zoom=zoom,
  maptype=""terrain"",
  destfile = ""terrain.png"")

<p>However, I got just a link: </p>

I want to do something with ""wearable"" devices to detect and recognize different type of gestures (like finger shooting) and use those gestures to control a game (e.g World of Warcraft or a Shooter).</p>

<p><strong>My question now is:</strong> What is the best way to put the converted data the sensors gives me into a action inside of a game. For example i fold my pointer finger like shooting a gun and this translates to the shooting key in the game of my choice.
Do i need some kind of DLL-Injection or is it far more difficult or easier than this?</p>

<p>I have different devices available and i could also use <a href=""http://www.arduino.cc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arduino.cc/</a>, which should make the life a lot easier, shouldn't it?
The problem is that i don't know how exactly the work flow here would be. Maybe someone could shed some light in this area, or push me in the right direction with some links, papers or something.</p>

'   Execute an XLM macro

<p>and to get a value,</p>

<pre><code>Sub TestGetValue()
    p = ""c:\XLFiles\Budget""
    f = ""Budget.xls""

        Next c
    Next r
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I think it's very well written. However I met two problems with it:
1. If the source cell in closed file is blank ("""" in VBA), I would got 0 in getvalue.  </p>

<p>I wonder how I can pass 0 to 0 and pass """" to """"?<br>
Is there a bug for ExecuteExcel4Macro?</p>

<p>2.Suppose the source file has different extensions: xls, xlsx, xlsm, or xlsb,...
How can I get a dynamic path?  </p>

<p>I tried to eliminate file extension in the path and use </p>

<pre><code>arg = ""'"" &amp; path &amp; ""["" &amp; file &amp; "".xl?]"" &amp; sheet &amp; ""'!"" &amp; _
          Range(ref).Range(""A1"").Address(, , xlR1C1)

Dropdown menus don't work, Orbit slider acting funny, etc. I figure there's a problem in my code. But if I checkout the same exact project on 2 different computers (a windows 7 PC and another MacBook Pro), everything works perfect.</p>

<p>I checked every file difference and the only file that's different is the <code>assets/foundation_and_overrides.css</code> file.</p>

<p>This is the difference, the rails server that's not working properly shows these kinds of lines:</p>

<pre><code>/* line 241, ../../../../.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194@ucode/gems/zurb-foundation-4.2.3/scss/foundation/components/_global.scss */
</code></pre>

<p>And the computers that work fine show something similar to:</p>

<pre><code>/* line 264, ../../../../../../Ruby193/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/zurb-foundation-4.3.1/scss/foundation/components/_global.scss */
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the issue seems to be that the bad rails server is using an older version of Zurb Foundation for some reason. Even though <code>bundle update</code> shows version 4.3.1. In fact, we specified this in the Gemfile:</p>

<p>What should I do so that yahoo, twitter and google will only authorize once (except on revoked permissions) and when the user returns and use it again it will automatically obtain the user data without asking authorization again?</p>

<p>here's a part of the code that performs the request:</p>

        &lt;p:menuitem value=""Stanford University"" ajax=""false"" action=""#{SessionBean.goToCentral}"" /&gt;
        &lt;p:menuitem value=""Universal Trade"" ajax=""false"" action=""#{SessionBean.goToTrade}"" /&gt;
   &lt;/p:menuButton&gt;
&lt;/h:form&gt; 
&lt;ui:insert name=""body""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>then my three jsf pages will use <code>ui:composition</code> and <code>ui:define</code> to include the template header. So the header of my template page have a <a href=""http://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/menubutton.jsf"" rel=""nofollow"">Primefaces menu button</a> This menu button bind to a <code>Session Scoped Managed Bean</code>. When you click on an item of this menu button, you will be redirect to one of the three jsf page. But I also want the menu button to reflect correctly which page I am look at. So here is my attempt</p>

<p>SessionBean.java  ---> Session Scoped Managed Bean</p>

<pre><code>public static final String MY_PROFILE = ""My Profile"";
public static final String CENTRAL_FEED = ""Stanford University"";
public static final String TRADE = ""Universal Trade"";
private String option = null;

@PostConstruct
public void init(){        
    me = scholarEJB.findUserByUserName(getLoginUserName());                
    if(me != null){        
    HttpServletRequest request =
            (HttpServletRequest) FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().
                getExternalContext().getRequest();
    String path = request.getServletPath();
    if(path.contains(""Profile"")){
        option = MY_PROFILE;
    }else if(path.contains(""CentralFeed"")){
        option = CENTRAL_FEED;
    }else if(path.contains(""TextBook"")){
        option = TRADE;
    }else{
        option = "" "";
    }
} 
public String goToProfile(){
    option = MY_PROFILE;
    return ""Profile.jsf?faces-redirect=true&amp;amp;userId=""+me.getId();
}
public String goToCentral(){
    option = CENTRAL_FEED;
    return ""CentralFeed.jsf?faces-redirect=true"";
}

public String goToTrade(){
    option = TRADE;
    return ""TextBook.jsf?faces-redirect=true"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>That work if I navigate using the menu button, but from any of the 3 page, I can also navigate to the others, and I still want the menu button to reflect correctly which page I am looking at. So let take a look at CentralFeed.jsf. So for a link to Profile.jsf I would do this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p:commandLink value=""Profile""
        action=""#{CentralFeed.goToProfile(CentralFeed.me.id)}"" ajax=""false""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So in CentralFeed.java, I have:</p>

<pre><code>public String goToProfile(Long userId){
    sessionBean.setOption(SessionBean.MY_PROFILE);  //sessionBean: Session Scoped Bean reference
    return ""Profile.jsf?faces-redirect=true&amp;amp;userId="" + userId;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I click the link, I got redirect to Profile.jsf, and the value of the menu button is <code>MY_PROFILE</code>. That work, I only have problem when I have to do lot of business logic to figure out what should be the output. That is what I try to do in my original code above. Depend on certain condition, I will generate the HTML. But now the link that I generate by <code>&lt;a href=""...""&gt;</code>, will only take me straight to <code>Profile.jsf</code>, but dont allow me to change the value of the menu button. Help please</p>

<pre><code>public async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; ActionAsync()

<p>will this full action work in background thread? And how to make my <code>GetSomeResult()</code> function be awaitable? It's return that <code>Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt;</code> is not awaitable.</p>

I've put some research into this and the avenues to take would either be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interfacing with python</li>
<li>Using Wt as a toolkit and layering SDL 2 on top of it.</li>
<li>Using QT creator and layering SDL 2 on top of it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly there must be other ways to do this, but my primary concern is the fact that SDL 2 expects some form of a window (SDL_Window) and renderer (SDL_Renderer), will my options help me overcome the hurdle? Or would I have to directly code SDL 2 into python and attempt to use that along with Django (or some other form of web app API) to do as I need?</p>

Have used an alert before the string to ensure that the string is holding the required content. Any help would be appreciated. </p>

<p>My code is as followed:</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>var Cid = calEvent.Cid;
            $("".titleU"").val(calEvent.title);
            $('.startDateU').val($.fullCalendar.formatDate(calEvent.start, ""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm""));
            $('.endDateU').val($.fullCalendar.formatDate(calEvent.end, ""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm""));
            $("".descriptionU"").val(calEvent.description);
            $("".clientU"").val(calEvent.clientName);
            $("".workOrderU"").val(calEvent.workOrderID);
            $("".jobLocationU"").val(calEvent.eventLocation);
            // For loop for adding employee to update panel
            var workOrderEmployeesA = """"; // Update form
            $.ajax({
                type: ""POST"", 
                url: ""&lt;?php echo base_url('scripts/phpScripts/getEmployeesCID.php');?&gt;"", 
                data: {Cid: Cid},
                datatype: ""html"",
                success: function(json){
                    workOrderEmployeesA = $.trim(json).substring(0, json.length -1);
                    alert(workOrderEmployeesA);
                }
            });         
            var workOrderEmployeesB = workOrderEmployeesA.toString().split('/');
            for(var i=0;i&lt;workOrderEmployeesB.length;i++){
                alert(workOrderEmployeesB[i]);
            }
</code></pre>

<p>PHP:</p>

<pre><code>    $result = mysqli_query($con,""SELECT * FROM employeeCalendar WHERE CalendarID='$_POST[Cid]'"");
$counter = 0;
while($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result)){
    echo $row['EmployeeID'];
    if($counter == mysqli_num_rows($result)){
    }else{
        echo ""/"";
    }
        $counter++;
}
mysqli_close($con);
</code></pre>

<p>The following code works correctly, but not sure how its different in any way that would prevent proper functionality.</p>

<pre><code>var workOrderEmployeesB = ""1/2/3/4/5"".split('/');
            for(var i=0;i&lt;workOrderEmployeesB.length;i++){
                alert(workOrderEmployeesB[i]);
            }
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably something silly that I've over looked, Any suggestions would be much appreciated. </p>

<p>Thank-you in advance,</p>

I started to think how similar sorting can be done in Scala.<br>
So we have a list of users. Every user has sorted list of organizations. And we want to sort this list of users by list of organization names. Users are sorted by first organization name and when first names are equal then they are compared by second names and so on.<br>
I have managed to write such sorting but in some cases it is giving wrong result. </p>

val u8  = new User(8,  List(o1,o2,o3,o4))
val u9  = new User(9,  List(o1,o2,o3,o5))
val u10 = new User(10, List())
val u11 = new User(11, List(o6))

val users = List(u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6, u7, u8, u9, u10, u11)

// below line should be improved
val sortedUsers = users.sortWith(_.organizations.foldLeft("""")((b,a) =&gt; b + a.name + "","") &lt; _.organizations.foldLeft("""")((b,a) =&gt; b + a.name + "","")) 

sortedUsers.foreach{ x =&gt; print(x.id+"" "")}

<p>For now my code is</p>

        for (Spatial spatial: h.values()) {

                engine.deleteEntity(spatial.owner);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>spatialList is an arrayList where each index is a zLevel</p>

<p>The spatial which displays the actual bullet is</p>

<pre><code>public void render(Canvas canvas) {
    float angle = (float) (vel.getAngle() * (180 / Math.PI));
    matrix.reset();
    matrix.setTranslate(pos.x - bullet.getWidth() / 2, pos.y - bullet.getHeight() / 2);
    matrix.postRotate(angle + 90,  pos.x, pos.y);
    canvas.drawBitmap(bullet, matrix, paint);
    canvas.drawCircle(pos.x, pos.y, col.getRadius(), paint);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can provide more code but these seem to be the main issue. I've tried everything I can think of and can't find much else online. The only thing I can think of to fix this is to switch from a surfaceview to a GLSurfaceview but I really think there is a better way and I'm just using bad code. </p>

<p>Edit: I noticed my timer was off and removed the drawcircle and after running it again I get 40ms~ around 500 which is still a bit too low for reasonable performance.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a ""root"" <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code> with a <code>NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType</code> Concurrency type. I use this MOC to persist my changes to the <code>NSPersistentStoreCoordinator</code>.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Once the <code>MainViewController</code> is loaded, it populates itself if empty.</p>

<p>At the end of the <code>populate</code>method, I make sure everything's properly persisted and also refetch my data:</p>

<p>Despite this, I cannot create <code>Post</code>s within my <code>Feed</code>s in a dedicated `localMOC``:</p>

<pre><code>NSManagedObjectID *feedID=[f objectID];

You would also use stored procedures so you don't have to use triggers, thereby avoiding some common pitfalls of triggers.</p>

<p>Another thought is to cover the whole database with views - so hardly anyone has access to tables themselves, they just do CRUD operations against views. That way, if you want to give someone access to certain columns, you can create a view for them that contains those columns, or just a computation. If you need to impose logic on update &amp; delete operations (i.e. preventing someone from affecting more than 2% of the total rows in a table) you can do this via an <code>instead of</code> trigger.</p>

<p>In order to not fall into common pitfalls of triggers, (1) triggers should only update tables, never other views. (2) Triggers are never put on tables. (3) Views can't access other views. (4) If for some reason you can't do what you want by following the first three rules, create a stored procedure.</p>

<p>The benefit I see from implementing security this way is that you only have to create a view and maybe some triggers (average case - 2 additional objects) whereas if you go the stored procedure route you will always be creating at least 3 or 4 additional objects (depending if you create procedures for select). Also, our NHibernate mappings would be simpler because we wouldn't have to map three procedures for every object.</p>

<p>The question is if there are significant security holes or practical problems with using mostly views and triggers rather than stored procedures.</p>

<p>For calculating moves that are valid and such, I planned to use two 2D arrays of objects. One array should contain the tile instances e.g. A8, B8, C8, D8 etc. and the other should contain the pieces of the board e.g. BR1, BB1. </p>

<p>We are currently updating our usability (tabindex, labels, etc).</p>

<p>I'm using a css class and jQuery (see code below) to change the cursor type to ""progress"" on form submit (and on ajax related partial page refresh/update, etc) so that the user instantly knows ""something"" is happening, via the class name ""loadWait.</p>

""removeProgressCursor"" at the appropriate time/place

<p>So the questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are there any known ""side effects"" of this kind of approach? (Have googled extensively and couldn't find anything which leads me to believe not).</p></li>
<li><p>We are discussing if we should also attach class=""loadWait"" to all of our links (obviously not the ones with target=""_blank"" as we don't want the cursor to change in this situation). What are your thoughts? Our reasoning being that at times, for whatever reason (high server load, slow internet connection, etc), there can be the odd lag of a couple of seconds between user ""link clicks"" and the actual page starting to render, this way the user would instantly know that ""something"" is happening (we are aware that the loading icon in the tab is there, but it is often missed by the user).
What are your thoughts? Is it an over kill doing this for all of our links? (not talking about man hours here).</p></li>
<li><p>Does anyone know what kind of extra page load time (if any) this will add? (how does $('.loadWait').click(function(){... work? Does jQuery inspect the whole DOM on page load for the ""click"" event, or on a ""click by click"" basis checking for a matching class name?).</p></li>
<li><p>Any other thoughts on any of this?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>How to send a word from my Delphi application right into the dictionary window, as if you typed it manually and pressed Enter?</p>

<p>The best solution is to send some message through the Windows mechanism, but if it is too complicated, there's another solution, and so the second answer: as I described, we need to model a [Ctrl+left mouse] click on a form where this word is displayed on a form [ a visual label on the screen of my Delphi application], to be exact, on some central pixel of this label.</p>

<p>Could you kindly give an advice how to do one thing or another in Delphi ?</p>

<p>** edit:
The problem with AppActivate is this: Babylon dict has a daemon part that seats in the tray.
In the task manager a real window where the text should be input also is named 'Babylon'.
So AppActivate('Babylon') tries to bring to front the non-visual part of the application.</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestion how to determine the windows handle or something of a real visual part of the application? In the task manager, I repeat both visual and non-visual parts are named 'Babylon'.</p>

Does a lack of memory model support means that legal C++11 programs that use <code>std::atomic&lt;T&gt;</code> arent seq consistent?</p>

<pre><code>     this_ws.Activate
     this_ws.Range(""A1"").Select
     ActiveSheet.PasteSpecial Link:=True
</code></pre>

<p>It does paste, and without error, but it invariably gives me values instead of links.</p>

<p>My ultimate goal is to convert a user-provided selection into a regular range. My research and experiments so far imply the only way to sanely do this (for certain values of ""sane"") is to paste as links in a temporary tab and then harvest the information necessary to create an equivalent range from those links. (Other, more headache-inducing ways involve DataObject or <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12117040/can-i-get-the-source-range-of-excel-clipboard-data"">monitoring a sheet for selection changes</a>.) </p>

<p>Update: According to Microsoft, <i>""If the source data isn't suitable for linking or the source application doesn't support linking, this parameter is ignored.""</i> So why would the source data not be ""suitable""? It's just another macro-enabled workbook, left open and with strings and ints in the copied selection.</p>

<p>Update2: To clarify, I am looking to duplicate (in VBA) the functionality you get from the GUI when you do a manual copy and then click the ""Paste Link(s)"" button in the lower left corner of the Paste Special dialog box. If I can Paste Links on a user-provided copy from VBA, I know I can do the rest. But I don't especially care if the clipboard is involved or not in this process; I just want the user to be able to select, do a ctrl-c, alt-tab over to my tool workbook, then hit a button that runs a macro on the range he/she just specified.</p>

<p>My thinking is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>initialize the Manager object in the <code>AppDelegate</code> initialization methods (as soon as the App gets lunched)</li>
<li>In the initialization method start an operation queue that fetches the data and, after every fetch, verifies if the new content is different than the previous one (that would be locally stored in a variable inside the Manager class.)</li>
<li>If the content is different change the <code>UIElement</code> (e.g. if it is a string then the <code>UILabel</code> would change, if it is an Image URL resource then the <code>UIIMage</code> will change).</li>
</ul>

<p>I have no idea on how to <strong>access to the <code>UILabel</code> element from the Manager class</strong>. Am I going in the wrong direction or is there some other way/pattern to do this?

Note: checking out 'android-2.2_r1'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b new_branch_name

HEAD is now at 279302e... Merge branch 'froyo' into froyo-release
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if I try to building the code using Eclipse I get lots of erros. One that got my attention was that this Launcher2 is using the ""android.renderscript"" that is only available  since Api level 11 (<a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/renderscript/package-summary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">renderscript reference</a>) - Froyo is Api level 8.</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -R renderscript *

<p>I guess that my checkout must have something wrong. From  <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/api-levels.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Api-Levels</a>, I guess that the version I checkeout must be for Android 3.0!</p>

<p>Any help solving this would be great!</p>

<p>To do this we must look at each edge; and during this loop there can contain no searches otherwise it would result in at least n log n time. I'm not sure how to do this without searching in the loop. It would mean that, somehow we must only look at each edge once, and decide rather to include it or not based on some ""static"" previous values that does not involve a growing data structure. </p>

<p>So.. let's say we keep the endpoints of the node in question, then look at the next node, if the next node has the same vertices as prev, then compare the weight of prev and current node and keep the lower one. If the current node's endpoints are not equal to prev, then it is in a different component .. now I am stuck because we cannot create a hash or array to keep track of the component nodes that are already added while look through each edge in linear time.</p>

<p>Another approach I thought of is to find the edge with the minimal weight; since the edge weights are distinct this edge will be part of any MST. Then.. I am stuck. Since we cannot do this for n - 1 edges in linear time.</p>

<p>Any hints?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>What if we know the number of nodes, the number of edges and also that each edge weight is distinct? Say, for example, there are n nodes, n + 6 edges?</p>

<p>Then we would only have to find and remove the correct 7 edges correct?</p>

So summed up I have about 5 shadows per cell. I reuse my cells but they change their height occasionally when the content exceeds a certain height (I say this because this could probably cause more draw calls with the 'optimisations' I enlist below). </p>

<p>Now, I have added the following optimisations:</p>

<pre><code>// setting it opaque will tell the GPU not to blend the 
// layer (-&gt; less draw calls - only useful when layer completely opaque obviously)
myShadowView.opaque = YES;

// another significant factor was the shadowPath property, 
// it significantly smoothed scrolling
myShadowView.layer.shadowOffset = CGSizeMake(0, -1);
myShadowView.layer.shadowOpacity = 0.08;
myShadowView.layer.shadowRadius = 1;
myShadowView.layer.shadowPath = [UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRect:shad.bounds].CGPath;

// the most important change
myShadowView.layer.shouldRasterize = YES;
myShadowView.layer.rasterizationScale = [UIScreen mainScreen].scale;
</code></pre>

<p>I am very very happy with the performance -- scrolling is smooth as baby skin -- but the <code>shouldRasterize</code> property comes with drawbacks. When I scroll down, it takes the cell a little while to load the bitmap. Is there any way to pre-render those cells ? Would a table without the reuse identifier get rid of the problem ? </p>

<p>I absolutely need the shadows, but I would not sacrifice performance for them. I hope someody can help. </p>

<p>I have a requirement to send JSON data after successful login. What this means is the JSON data has to be passed on to the client along with the login page. And on the login page we need to access this JSON data and render it. Frankly this is the same data which requested by the Ext-JS code on the login.html page. The goal is to avoid additional requests by AJAX call.</p>

<p>I tried out various examples on stackoverflow and other websites (just avoiding mention, to prevent cluttering) and created a custom authentication handler, and made changes appropriately. Everything works fine but not a way to send JSON/any data to client.</p>

<p>On the onAuthenticationSuccess method in CustomAuthenticationHandler I have the following code to see if I could get this value, but I could not. What I understand is since its a HTML/static content I can't pass session value to client and that needs to be a JSP. (Please correct me if wrong!) I can't change the HTML to JSP for bureaucratic reasons:</p>

<p>I open Instruments.app, create a new UI Recorder template, select my application's .app bundle from the Target -> Choose Target menu, hit Record, open a couple of documents, type some stuff on them, close the documents, quit the app.</p>

<p>At this point UI Recorder stops and the Record button changes to ""Drive &amp; Record"".  I hit it, I see my application get launched and Instruments start recording data.  Then Instruments gets confused (somehow)... my application loses focus, and suddenly UI Recorder is replaying all of my actions <em>in Instruments!!</em>, which just screws with Instruments in all kinds of messy ways.  In this state I'm unable to move the mouse (the system just steals the cursor back), and I'm unable to quit instruments, since when I hit CMD+Q I'm prompted to Save the document, which I can't do because I have no control of the keyboard or mouse.</p>

<p>This is really frustrating.  Has anyone got experience with this tool who can tell me where I'm going wrong?  I'm scared to run it a third time as it literally hijacks my entire system.</p>

Database named -&gt; acastro
Table called -&gt; contacto
Fields in table are -&gt; id, nome, email

<p><strong>I making an Yii2 application, and need to connect a highcharts chart to a table field in my database.
How can i inside an action called actionAdmin connect to my database and then count the number of id's in my Contacto table stored inside acastro database.</strong></p>

<p>In the old Yii1.xx i used to establish connection this way:</p>

<pre><code>public function actionAdmin() {
$sql = Yii::app()-&gt;db-&gt;createCommand('
SELECT count(*) as total
FROM contacto
')-&gt;queryAll();

$total = array();

for ($i = 0; $i &lt; sizeof($sql); $i++){
$total[] = (int) $sql[$i][""total""];
}
$this-&gt;render('admin', array('total' =&gt; $total));
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that this syntax no longer works in Yii2, and i've tried the sintaxe explained in Yii2 api guide but it always give's me error of undefined variable. Here is the code that i'm using to connect acording to Yii2 api guide:</p>

<pre><code>use yii\db\Command;
$total = $connection-&gt;createCommand('SELECT count (*) FROM contacto')-&gt;queryAll();

Just one item could be selected at the moment, and when the user clicks on another item, this item is cleaned of 'active-child' class and then this class gets assigned to the newly selected item. Just like any other non-multiple list.</p>

<p>Here is the selected element's HTML:</p>

<p><code>&lt;div id=""5"" class=""new-child-item new-child-item-active active-child""&gt; Software &lt;/div&gt;</code></p>

<p>When I want to submit the selected item's ""id"" to a php script to process it further, the jquery does not retrieve the id value of the element and says it is <code>undefined</code>. My approach to getting the selected item's <code>id</code> attribute is as follows:</p>

<p><code>$('.active-child').attr('id');</code></p>

<p>I also have tested this, but still returns <code>undefined</code>:</p>

<p><code>$('.active-child:first-child').attr('id');</code></p>

<p>The strange thing is that I first check to see if the user has selected anything at all, and if yes, then do the ajax, at this moment, the jquery returns <code>1</code>, means the user has selected one item. Here is the code block which checks to see the selection and then send it through ajax:</p>

<pre><code> if($('.active-child').length &gt; 0)
                  {
                      $('.new-item-cats-list-holder').empty();
                       $('.new-item-cats-list-holder').hide()
                  $('.big-loader').show();
                      console.log(""This is the id: "" + $('.new-child-item-active:first-child').attr('id'));

<p>If I setup a sync scope on two sql servers and syncing is working fine for a while?
And then I need to change the schema for one of the tables. Lets say I need to add a column, or change the primary key.</p>

<p>How do I go about doing this so that Microsoft Sync Framework still syncs that table properly?</p>

<p>I assume that I run the change scripts for the table on both machines (thats the easy part). but how do I let Sync Framework know that there is a change and that the scope metadata needs to change?</p>

<p>Now I want to control, which items the user selects. A simple example is that he shouldn't be able to select child nodes of different parents. But there are also more ViewModel-specific use cases.</p>

<p>It's easy to achieve this in code-behind of the Window by using the PreviewSelectionChanged event, checking the conditions directly and setting the Cancel-flag accordingly. But since I want to obtain the separation of View and ViewModel, I am looking for a way of doing this in my WindowViewModel.</p>

<p>Of course you could also extract the check to the ViewModel and call it from the view, but it looks wrong:</p>

<pre><code>WindowViewModel _viewModel;

void PreviewSelectionChanged(object sender, PreviewSelectionChangedEventArgs e)
{
     e.Cancel = !this._viewModel.CanSelect(e.Item as TreeItemViewModel);

<p>More details:</p>

<p>1) My source is a PDF page containing images and text (maybe some vectorial drawings) and embedded fonts.</p>

<p>2) There's an interface to design multiple 'crop boxes'.</p>

<p>3) I must generate a new PDF that contains only what is inside the crop boxes. Anything else must be removed from resulting document (indeed I may accept content which is half inside and half outside, but this is not the ideal and it should not appear anyway).</p>

<p>My solution so far:</p>

<p>I have successfully developed a solution that creates new temporary documents, each one containing the content of each crop box (using writer.GetImportedPage and contentByte.AddTemplate to a page that is exactly the size of the crop box). Then I create the final document and repeat the process, using the AddTemplate method do position each ""cropped page"" in the final page.</p>

<p>This solution has 2 big disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>the size of the document is the [original size] * [number of crop boxes], since the entire page is there, stamped many times! (invisible, but it's there)</li>
<li>the invisible text may still be accessed by selecting all (CTRL+A) within Reader and pasted.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I think I need to iterate through PDF objects, detect if it is visible or not, and delete it. At the time of writing, I am trying to use pdfReader.GetPdfObject.</p>

<p>Beyond this setup, I'm unsure how to trigger the creation of notifications based on certain events in your application. I'm also a little unsure of how I'd need to set up routing - would it be it's own separate resource or nested in the user resource? I'd find it very helpful if someone could expand on this.</p>

I am reading lines from a file, and trying to store each line (as a string) in an array. I am then using strtok on that line to parse another value out of the line. For some reason, the value I put in the array changes after I use strtok. Code is below:</p>

<pre><code>while(fgets(readLine, 100, inFile) != NULL) { 
    printf(""j = %d\n"", j);
    puts(readLine); 
    machineList[j] = readLine;
    puts(machineList[j]); //the value of machineList[j] at this point is equal
                          // to the current readLine 

    int i=0;

    day = strtok(readLine, "" ,"");

    puts(machineList[j]); //the value of machineList[j] at this point is no
                          //longer what it was at the previously noted point

    while(i&lt;3) {

    }
    dayList[j]=atoi(day);

    printf(""Day is: %d\n\n"", dayList[j] );  //these values come out as expected
    j++;

}
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone explain why this is happening? I don't understand, since its not like I am reassigning machineList[j]=readLine. Thus, even if the value of readLine changes, it shouldn't change the value in machineList[j]. Again, I am new to C, so I realize my code semantics could be awful- anything is helpful. Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>chapterlist.clear();
cScene newscene;
newscene.name = ""Laura does something."";
newscene.words = 432;
newscene.pov = ""Laura"";
cChapter newchapter;
newchapter.scenelist.push_back(newscene);
chapterlist.push_back(newchapter);
</code></pre>

<p>chapterlist is a cChapter vector.</p>

<p>I am creating a new cScene object, and pushing it onto the scenelist vector of a new cChapter object, which I then push onto chapterlist.</p>

<p>My question is: when I am pushing objects onto a vector, is all the data being duplicated into the vector, while the old data is destroyed from the stack when the scope ends?</p>

<p>Or is something else happening???</p>

<p>Currently, Ninject and its Extension Libraries all have the same Major.Minor number. The next release of Ninject core will be backward compatible thus increasing the minor number is the correct action. At least one of the extension libraries will not be backward compatible. In this case the correct action would be to increase the major number. But this will put the core and extensions out of sync.</p>

<p>The question is which option do you consider the best that will cause the least confusion:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Correctly increase the major number with the advantage that the version number reflects the backwards incompatibility and the disadvantage that the core and the extensions are put out of sync so that it won't be easy to to tell what matches anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the major number for the extension and increase only the minor number. With the advantage that the numbers are the same and it is easy to tell what matches. But the dsiadvantage that the number doesn't reflect the backward incompatibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase the major number of everything. With the advantage that the numbers are the same. But the disadvantage that the core and several extensions have the major number increased even though they are backward compatible.</p></li>

<p>The primary task of the app is to start at boot and run in the backgroud without a significant gui, monitoring bluetooth low energy transmissions and doing some computing on the data. Occasionally it should open some gui screens to interact with the user. And the user should be able to start the gui from the home screen as well.</p>

<p>I would like to keep the code small and light and would like to expose a class to the gui side of the system so that the gui code can make direct calls to the background core like:</p>

<pre><code>core.getSomeData(id)
core.setSomeData(data)
core.doSomeWork(task)
</code></pre>

<p>Without having to pass data through intent calls and whatnot, which seems to require a lot of extra code and reduce the readability of the program.
I.e. to run the gui and the service in the same runtime space as one program.</p>

<p>The complete system will consist of a few bluetooth low energy gadgets we're building and an android app to run the data gathering and control.<br>
- I'm willing to sacrifice battery on the phone to save battery on the the gadgets.<br>
- The gadgets will piggyback most of their data on the ble advertisement packages and the phone will monitor the ble ad channels with somewhat tight real time requirements gathering data without fully connecting.<br>
- The phone will connect to the gadgets to exchange data and send commands when necessary by system state, or when initiated by user activity.</p>

<p>Right now I'm looking at setting up the background core as a ""foreground service"" starting at boot.<br>
? Can I start up gui screens directly from the service on occasion and keep them in the same runtime space (for the simple access as shown above)?<br>
? Any simple way to allow the user to initiate the gui elements from the ""home screen""? E.g. by writing a second app that just signals the service to fire up certain gui screens?</p>

<p>Is there another solution which would be cleaner, better, or more ""the android way"" of solving this?</p>

I also use filters to filter the movies within the DataGridView. When I do this a couple of times I get an error from the nVLC DLL:</p>

...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</p>

<p>And on for a long time.  I want to consolidate the observations by ID and generate a co-occurance matrix of observations observed by observer ID.  I managed this on a subset of the data but some of the stuff I did ""manually"" that it wouldn't be practical to do for the entire set. (see code below) I am resisting the urge to use loops because everyone tells me if you use a loop in R you're doing it wrong, but I'm not sure how else to achieve this.  </p>

<p>Here's what worked for the smaller set:</p>

<pre><code>tfmat = data.frame(cmsclip$ID[1:100],
              cmsclip$tree[1:100] %in% c(cmsclip$tree[1]),
               cmsclip$tree[1:100] %in% c(cmsclip$tree[2]),
               cmsclip$tree[1:100] %in% c(cmsclip$tree[3]),
               cmsclip$tree[1:100] %in% c(cmsclip$tree[4]),
               cmsclip$tree[1:100] %in% c(cmsclip$tree[5]),
               cmsclip$tree[1:100] %in% c(cmsclip$tree[6]),
               cmsclip$tree[1:100] %in% c(cmsclip$tree[7]),
               cmsclip$tree[1:100] %in% c(cmsclip$tree[9]),
               cmsclip$tree[1:100] %in% c(cmsclip$tree[10]),
               cmsclip$tree[1:100] %in% c(cmsclip$tree[11]))
colnames(tfmat) &lt;- c('ID', cmsclip$tree[1:7], cmsclip$tree[9:11])
</code></pre>

<p>I just picked the first 10 unique tree names which in the full block of data happened to be cmsclip$tree[1:7], cmsclip$tree[9:11], and only looked at those, on the first 100 observations, generating a TRUE/FALSE matrix for each tree on each line.  Then I used split() to split consolidate the data by ID number and summed each column (now representing a specific tree) to see how many of that tree each observer recorded. </p>

<pre><code>testsplit = split(tfmat, tfmat[1])
summed1 &lt;-colSums(testsplit$`ficus`)
summed2 &lt;-colSums(testsplit$`cherry`)
summed3 &lt;-colSums(testsplit$`juniper`)
summed4 &lt;-colSums(testsplit$`pine`)
summed5 &lt;-colSums(testsplit$`olive`)
summed6 &lt;-colSums(testsplit$`elm`)
summed7 &lt;-colSums(testsplit$`rain`)
summed8 &lt;-colSums(testsplit$`redwood`)
summed9 &lt;-colSums(testsplit$`shimpaku`)
summed10 &lt;-colSums(testsplit$`maple`)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is I typed each name in by hand and I can't do that with the whole data frame.  This is where I'm looking for something better.  I think combined each line into a final matrix that just had the number of observations of each tree in a given column where one line represented one ID number.  </p>

<pre><code>finmat = data.frame(summed1[2:11],summed2[2:11],summed3[2:11],
                summed4[2:11],summed5[2:11],summed6[2:11],
                summed7[2:11],summed8[2:11],summed9[2:11],
                summed10[2:11],summed11[2:11])
</code></pre>

<p>Then I did this...</p>

<pre><code>finmat &lt;- t(finmat)
treenames &lt;- c(cmsclip$tree[1:7], cmsclip$tree[9:11])
colnames(finmat) &lt;- treenames

total_occurrences &lt;- colSums(finmat)
data_matrix &lt;- as.matrix(finmat)
co_occurrence &lt;- t(data_matrix) %*% data_matrix
library(igraph)
graph &lt;- graph.adjacency(co_occurrence,
                                                weighted=TRUE,
                                                mode=""undirected"",
                                                diag=FALSE)

plot(graph,
      vertex.label=names(data),
      vertex.size=total_occurrences*5,
      edge.width=E(graph)$weight*8)
</code></pre>

<p>It worked fine, it's just not scaleable to a much larger set of data (too much manual stuff).  Any suggestions for a faster way would be appreciate.  Thanks! </p>

<p>EDIT: Ideally I would like to create a matrix where the rows correspond to the ID numbers and the columns to each individual tree, and it would show how many of each tree was observed.  e.g.: </p>

<p>ID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ficus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cherry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;juniper&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;olive&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>11000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>11112&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br>12223&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>12334&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
...</p>

<p>I should add that I actually ultimately want to do hierarchical clustering on the data using the co-occurrence of observations of the different trees as a way to calculate the ""distance"" between trees.  So any suggestions on how to achieve that would be great.  And I could potentially abandon generating the above matrix if there is an easy way to jump from what I have to a distance matrix. </p>

I ran Fiddler2 to inspect the traffic and no traffic occurs when I click on the URL bar and hit enter even though you see the world icon spin and it seems to be doing stuff for a 1/2 second.</p>

<p>What could cause this behavior? Seems like it has to be Javascript and/or an Update Panel that's intercepting the Page_Load.</p>

<p>Specifics: The site is an AbleCommerce and the page is the cart page. We've customized the product selection process. </p>

<p>I'm able to replicate the problem on our test instance of the site so I added Breakpoints to both the Page_Init and Page_Load functions of the custom control that loads the cart. Under IE8, I can put my cursor in IE8's url bar and hit enter and the breakpoints never get hit. Any other browser, they get hit. Running IE9 in IE8 Browser Mode, they get hit. But in IE8, they only get hit when I do a refresh (F5). </p>

<p>I'm thinking this has to be a Javascript or Update Panel issue. There are no Javascript errors showing in the Firefox Error console or in IE8. </p>

<p>Any thoughts on what might be causing this? Or how I can troubleshoot it?</p>

<p>I have a few clues as to what the problem is, I'm obviously not allowed to instantiate an abstract class, and I believe some of the code in MyClass is trying to do this, even though this is not my intention. Some researching has suggested that I should reference the object as a pointer to achieve what I want, but my attempts so far have failed and I'm not even sure that this is the answer (hence my asking here).</p>

<p>I'll submit now that I'm more familiar with Java than C++, and I'm sure part of my problem is due to this.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what I'm trying to do in my program:</p>

<pre><code>class A {
    public:
    	virtual void action() = 0;
};

class B : public A {
    public:
    	B() {}

    	void action() {
    		// Do stuff
    	}
};

class MyClass {

    public:

    	void setInstance(A newInstance) {
    		instance = newInstance;
    	}

    	void doSomething() {
    		instance.action();
    	}

    private:

    	A instance;
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    MyClass c;
    B myInstance;
    c.setInstance(myInstance);
    c.doSomething();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This example produces the same compiler error that I am getting in my program:</p>

<pre><code>sean@SEAN-PC:~/Desktop$ gcc -o test test.cpp
test.cpp:20: error: cannot declare parameter ‘newInstance’ to be of abstract type ‘A’
test.cpp:2: note:   because the following virtual functions are pure within ‘A’:
test.cpp:4: note:   virtual void A::action()
test.cpp:30: error: cannot declare field ‘MyClass::instance’ to be of abstract type ‘A’

test.cpp:36: error: cannot allocate an object of abstract type ‘A’
test.cpp:2: note:   since type ‘A’ has pure virtual functions
</code></pre>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Thanks for the feedback everyone.</p>

<p>I've since changed ""MyClass::instance to contain a pointer of type A, but I now get some bizarre errors related to the vtable:</p>

<p>After further digging, I found that we had a <strong>related</strong> cache item (an index) that's causing issues when it expires prior to the ""main"" cache item.

    &lt;td&gt;var cumulative = 0.0; $('table.quote-review-group-component').eq(0).find('tr').each( function( i,el ){var singleStackTotal = $(el).find('td').eq(4).html();if( singleStackTotal ){cumulative += parseFloat( singleStackTotal.substring(1) );} }); cumulative = cumulative.toFixed(2)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;echo&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${cumulative}&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;verifyEquals&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;£${cumulative}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${total}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally I'd like to be able to point to an external js file rather than have the javascript in the command as a string, so that I can load in some test functions and use storeEval to get the return of the function</p>

<p>So we'd have </p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;runExternalScript&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;/path/to/external/extra-tests.js&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;storeEval&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;selenium.browserbot.getUserWindow().getCumulative(0)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;cumulative0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;verifyEquals&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;£${cumulative}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${total}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the external script would look like this</p>

<pre><code>function checkSingleGroupListTotal( index ){
    if ( index == ""undefined"" ){
        index = 0;
    }
    var cumulative = 0.0; 
    $('table.quote-review-group-component').eq(index).find('tr').each( function( i,el ){
        var singleStackTotal = $(el).find('td').eq(4).html();    
        if( singleStackTotal ){         
            cumulative += parseFloat( singleStackTotal.substring(1) );     
        } 
    }); 
    return cumulative.toFixed(2);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thinking about it a plugin which adds a loadScript action which checks for the external js file and then passes the file contents to runScript would do the job.  But I don't want to reinvent the wheel, and I've never built a plug in before.</p>

Prior that, I use to write raw queries using JDBC and make Database do the heavy lifting via Stored Procedures. With ORM, I was initially happy to do stuff like <code>coach.manager</code> and <code>manager.coaches</code> which were very simple and easy to read.</p>

<p>But as time went by there were in-numerous associations creeping up and I ended up doing <code>a.b.c.d</code> which were firing queries in all directions, behind the scenes. With rails and ruby, the garbage collector went nuts and took insane time to load a very complex page which involves relatively lesser data. I had to replace this ORM style code by a simple Stored procedure and the result I saw was enormous. A page that took 50 seconds to load now takes only 2 seconds.</p>

<p>With this huge difference, should I continue using ORM? It is very clear it has severe overheads compared to a raw query.</p>

<p>In general, what are the general pitfalls of using an ORM framework like Hibernate, ActiveRecord?</p>

<p>Both models go like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Game &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :player, class_name: ""User""
  belongs_to :gamer_one, class_name: ""User"", primary_key: ""gamer_one"", foreign_key: ""uid""
  belongs_to :gamer_two, class_name: ""User"", primary_key: ""gamer_one"", foreign_key: ""uid""
  belongs_to :gamer_three, class_name: ""User"", primary_key: ""gamer_one"", foreign_key: ""uid""
end 

class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :games, foreign_key: 'player_id'
  has_many :game_ones, class_name: 'Game', foreign_key: 'gamer_one', primary_key: 'uid'
  has_many :game_twos, class_name: 'Game', foreign_key: 'gamer_two', primary_key: 'uid'
  has_many :game_threes, class_name: 'Game', foreign_key: 'gamer_three', primary_key: 'uid'
end
</code></pre>

<p>When I go to the console and check for User.game_ones, User.game_twos, or User.game.threes, I get the exact relation I want, but if I make it backwards (Game.gamer_one, Game.gamer_two, Game.gamer_three) I just get null, and the query is doing is wrong.</p>

<p>Any idea if the belongs_to relation I'm doing is wrong in some point?</p>

<p>I can retrieve the comments for an application using the standard DQL<code>SELECT u FROM Comment WHERE :application = application</code></p>

<p>When lopping through the comments, I want to see if the logged in user has already liked a comment. </p>

<p>In symfony1, I would have used a simple lazy query <code>$comment-&gt;hasUserLiked()</code></p>

<p>At the moment, in symfony2, I have to do a query of all the user likes  for an application comments and a query of all the application comments.</p>

<p>When looping through application comments I do a sub-loop in each comment to check whether that a user likes record exists in the user likes comments collection. This is not clean.</p>

<p>Hope this makes sense.</p>

<p>Is there a better way?</p>

<p>EDIT: I could use a sub-controller to render whether a user likes the comment or not....but that seems rather over the top just for a couple of lines of html. Although, cleaner than the current implementation.</p>

<p>I.e.http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/sermons/gods-good-news-concerning-his-son</p>

<p>It works great, however because of the  tag which gets loaded through javascript, the WebView begins downloading the mp3 without user input as soon as the page loads.</p>

<p>I have tried calling WebView.stopLoading() once progress has finished, as well as shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url) to try to catch ending with "".mp3"" but it doesn't seem to be able to able to stop it!</p>

<p>My main concern is the amount of data it automatically downloads, if there's any way to stop the download or replace the  tags before the page loads that would be great.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> actually I found the reason the Audio tags were loading without user prompt is because it is using flash. Once I enabled plugins on webview it stops downloading by itself. However I will still be interested to know how to stop  tags within webviews in Android downloading data in background without user knowledge!</p>

<p>Is there a built-in support for this in NServiceBus?</p>

<p>If not, How can I achieve this goal?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Here is an example I wrote in the comment below:
say I have a book library. Each client is interested in receiving <em>immediate</em> notification about new books added to the library, but each client is allowed to be notified only about a certain genre. The system should send a notification to all the clients containing the new books information, but each client should only be notified about his specific genre. For security reasons, I can't filter the data in the client.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<ul>
<li>On sheet 1 there is a filled table</li>
<li>On sheet 2 there is an empty table with the same column headers</li>
<li>On sheet 2 the table is filled by the user with the exception of the last column</li>
<li>On sheet 2 in the last column there should be <strong>a dropbox in each row. This dropbox must contain a selection of values from the same column in table 1.

</ul>

<p>The whole thing should require no additional user interaction and should also allow inserting arbitrary values in addition to those of the dropbox.</p>

<p>My question is, if the class name is being checked it's existence in a array (I added this, it wasn't in the book examples), what security considerations should I take more? The class name will bot be outputted so XSS filtering doesn't make much sense. Also the class name will not hit the database, so SQL injection filtering it's not needed.</p>

My deployed cloud code is the following:</p>

<pre><code>Parse.Cloud.beforeSave(Parse.Installation, function(request, response) {
   Parse.Cloud.useMasterKey();
   var query = new Parse.Query(Parse.Installation);
   //PROBLEM: request.object.get(""username"") is undefined...
   query.equalTo(""username"", request.object.get(""username""));
   query.first().then(function(duplicate) {
      if (typeof duplicate === ""undefined"") {
          console.log(""Duplicate does not exist, New installation"");
          response.success();
      } else {
          console.log(""Duplicate exist..Trying to delete "" + duplicate.id);
          duplicate.destroy().then(function(duplicate) {
              console.log(""Successfully deleted duplicate"");
              response.success();
          }, function() {
              console.log(error.code + "" "" + error.message);
              response.success();
          });

      }
   }, function(error) {
      console.warn(error.code + error.message);
      response.success();
   });
})
</code></pre>

<p>The problem, as it is commented inline on the code, is that the <code>request.object.get(""username"")</code> returns undefined. In fact, all the properties of <code>request.object</code> are undefined! </p>

<p>On my android client app I associate the ParseUser and also the username to the ParseInstallation object, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>user.signUpInBackground(new SignUpCallback() {
public void done(ParseException e) {
    if (e == null) {
        ParseInstallation installation = ParseInstallation.getCurrentInstallation();
        installation.put(""username"", username);
        installation.put(""user"", user);
        installation.saveInBackground(new SaveCallback() {
            @Override
            public void done(ParseException e) {
                if(e == null) {
                    Log.e(TAG, ""Parse installation was created successfully!"");
                } else {
                    Log.e(TAG, ""An error occurred while saving Parse installation: "" + e.toString());
                }
            }
        });

        //more code...

    } else {
        Log.e(TAG, ""Signup error: "" + e.getMessage());

        //more code...
    }
}
});
</code></pre>

<p>So, given the above, one would expect that, on the parse cloud, <code>request.object.get(""username"")</code> would return the actual user username and not undefined, correct??? (Btw, yes I have checked that the username variable on the android client code is not null nor empty!) </p>

<p>Why the hell <code>request.object</code> properties are all undefined??? </p>

<p>How to get <code>username</code> from ParseInstallation on the cloud trigger then???</p>

<p>Also, did anyone experienced this problem from an IOS client app?</p>

<p>If the user chooses one of the countries (onchange), 
a new drop down list for cities appears 
displaying only the cities of this specific country.</p>

<p>I have implemented that by using php, mysql and ajax.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_database.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_database.asp</a></p>

<p>The  drop down list for cities is displayed automatically on the web page
without loading the page again.</p>

<p>When the cities box appears, if i do
Ctrl-U in order to see the source code of the page, 
the html code for the <strong>drop down list of cities</strong> is not in the source code page.</p>

<p>My problem is that when i submit the form, 
the value of the cities' drop down list
is <strong>NOT sent</strong> to the <strong>submit.php</strong> file</p>

<p><strong>index.php</strong></p>

<pre><code> &lt;form action=""submit.php"" name=""my_form"" method=""post""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>submit.php</strong></p>

<pre><code> echo $_POST['cities'];
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>$_POST['cities'];</strong> is blank.</p>

<p>That means that in the submit page <strong>NO value
for cities' drop down list was sent.</strong></p>

<p>What am i supposed to do in order to fix that?</p>

I've managed to get most of the expanding done but I'm stuck at a very weird case that I can't figure out.</p>

<p>I have CSS that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>.innerRight {
border:0;color:#000;width:auto;padding-top:0;margin:0;
}
a {
color:#000;text-decoration:underline;font-size:12px;
}
p,small,ul,li {
color:#000;font-size:12px;padding:0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried <code>(.+):(.+);</code> as the search and <code>\t\1: \2;\n</code> as the replace. The find RegEx is valid, the only problem is that it matches the entire line of attributes. I've tried the non-greedy character, but I must not be putting it in the right place.</p>

<p>What the above find RegEx matches is:</p>

<pre><code>0: border:0;color:#000;width:auto;padding-top:0;margin:0;
1: color:#000;text-decoration:underline;font-size:12px;
2: color:#000;font-size:12px;padding:0;
</code></pre>

<p>While those are technically correct matches, I need it to match <code>border:0;</code>, <code>color:#000;</code>, etc separately for my replace to work.</p>

<p><code>$parse</code> appears to be defined by <code>ParseProvider</code> in <code>parse.js</code>, which appears to define some kind of mini-syntax of its own (the file is 900 lines long).</p>

<p>Conceptually, it makes sense for the form validation to fail if the username is already taken.  However, the form validation and the saving of the successfully created user model are separate steps, so there's a race condition where the validation can pass but the actual <code>user.save()</code> can fail with an <code>IntegrityError</code>.</p>

<p>I'm unclear on what happens if both the form validation and the <code>user.save()</code> step are wrapped in the same <code>transaction.atomic()</code> block -- my assumption is that postgres will not create any locks when the table is read to check if the row exists, and therefore the transaction will not prevent the race condition at all.</p>

<p>Assuming that's the case, what is the best way to handle this?  Here are the options I'm considering so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Skip the username uniqueness validation entirely and just catch the <code>IntegrityError</code> on save time, adding to the form errors list manually.  This is bulletproof, but moves some validation logic outside of the form definition.</li>
<li>Do both the validation step and the try/except block around the <code>IntegrityError</code>.  This may add duplicate code, but now the form works in isolation and the use of the form in the view doesn't cause a race condition.</li>

The issue here, I want to deliver both safe html and markdown markup to the data store and of course restore the actual representation when fetched, the issue is I want to preserve safe html tags and add some functions to embed videos for example, </p>

<p>First trial used the following sequence:</p>

<ul>
<li>editing done</li>
<li>posted to the api</li>
<li>raw text from the editor is encoded and saved</li>
</ul>

<p>Now for displaying the edited data:</p>

<ul>
<li>fetch encoded string</li>
<li>return it as response </li>
<li>parse it with built-in parser (Marked.js)</li>
</ul>

<p>The previous process is broken of course, for example the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags are rendered to be displayed, this is mainly because of the <code>HttpUtility/WebUtility</code> way of handling the html encoding. it becomes difficult to distinguish what is to be displayed as <code>code</code> for example and what is to be rendered like embedded <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> for a video.</p>

<p>When I post some markdown/html markup like the following:</p>

<pre><code>#Hello, World

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl71urqKu0

&lt;iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/veJZDANY6go"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;huhuhu&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;script&gt;alert(""fail"")&lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;script&gt;alert(""win"")&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is what I get from my <code>WebUtility.HtmlEcode()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""status"": ""#Hello, World\n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl71urqKu0\n\n&amp;lt;iframe width=&amp;#39;420&amp;#39; height=&amp;#39;315&amp;#39; src=&amp;#39;http://www.youtube.com/embed/veJZDANY6go&amp;#39; frameborder=&amp;#39;0&amp;#39; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;huhuhu&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(&amp;#39;fail&amp;#39;)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;\n\n    &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(&amp;#39;win&amp;#39;)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;""
}
</code></pre>

<p>The previous encoded string also breaks in terms of displaying the actual code after parsing with <strong>Marked.js</strong> I get for example magically added <code>&amp;</code> in my XSS attempt which even breaks the displaying of the code. For clarification, it would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;script&amp;amp;gt;alert(&amp;amp;#39;win&amp;amp;#39;)&amp;amp;lt;/script&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm aware that there is <strong><em>antixss</em></strong> library that can sanitize the code but does that make it completely safe to store in a database? </p>

<p>Also I was thinking of parsing the actual links and building the embedding string on the server instead of allowing handling raw html, is this feasible?</p>

Basically, when a user selects an item from a DropDownList, a value (<code>between 1 and N where N &lt;= 20</code>) is sent back to the server. I'd then like this value to be used as an index (if using arrays) or key (if using a dictionary) within the session. I don't want the value to be seen by the user, hence why it's not stored in the DDL. From what I gather, dictionaries are designed for key-lookups. However, since the scale is quite small, are there any overheads of using a dictionary that could make it less efficient in this case? Each corresponding value is unique to the user, so I've decided to use  sessions.</p>

<p>I've never really thought about it before and use both side by side to get the results where needed but it's possible to design in both ways as shown in the examples below:</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<p><code>&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></p>

<p><strong>CSS Example 1</strong> - Using margin, padding</p>

<pre><code>div{
    width:1000px;
    margin:auto;
    }
ul{
    margin-left:10px;

span{
    margin-top:10px;

<p><strong>CSS Example 2</strong> - Using just positioning
(Apart from the margin:auto ..)</p>

<pre><code>div, ul, span{
    position:absolute;
    }   

div{
    width:1000px;
    margin:auto;
    }
ul{
    left:10px;
    width:100px;
    }
li{

    }
span{
     top:10px;

I have a simple mapping</p>

 Map(x =&gt; x.Name).Length(45);
 Map(x =&gt; x.Value).LazyLoad();
 Map(x =&gt; x.Description).Length(200);
 Version(x =&gt; x.CreatedDate);
 HasManyToMany(x =&gt; x.ProductVariants);
</code></pre>

<p>And my object has:</p>

<pre><code> public virtual int Id {get;set;}
 public virtual string Name { get; set; }
 public virtual byte[] Value { get; set; }
 public virtual string Description { get; set; }
 public virtual DateTime CreatedDate { get; set; }
 public virtual IList&lt;ProductVariant&gt; ProductVariants { get; set; } 
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to retrieve object with:</p>

<pre><code> using (var session = GetSessionFactory().OpenSession())
        {
            return session
                .CreateCriteria&lt;DataResource&gt;()
                .List&lt;DataResource&gt;()
                .ToArray();
        }

<p>But it fails with:</p>

<pre><code>Checks loading of data resource: NHibernate.PropertyAccessException : Invalid Cast (check your mapping for property type mismatches); setter of ***.DataResource
  ----&gt; System.InvalidCastException : Unable to cast object of type 'System.Object' to type 'System.Byte[]'.
</code></pre>

<p>But when I remove .LazyLoad() for the Value field - all works.
What am I doing wrong? My Nhibernate version is 3.1.0.4000</p>

<p>It's not a requirement to load lazy that property. I just do not want to load it at all for now (it will be loaded fulfilled in another part of the application). I saw some solutions to this problem in the internet, however most of them using seperate lazy class or custom query. But I need to have one table and one class for this mapping and writing custom queries is forbidden.</p>

<p>Upd: Forgot to add that session.Save(dataResource); is working ok. The problem is only with how to get data from the table</p>

Now, in order to ease the workload on the users I have to split them over days.<br>
So, if an account has <strong>service orders</strong> they must be inserted to the list that will be distributed over 547 days (a year and a half). If an account has no <strong>service orders</strong> they must be inserted to the list that will be distributed over 45 days (a month and a half).<br>
I am using the following LINQ extension from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5660819/grouping-results-fairly-using-linq"">a question I asked before</a>:  </p>

<p>I saw <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10244604/php-best-practice-keep-track-of-logged-in-users"">an answer</a> on stackoverflow that looked interesting.</p>

<p>I heard about something called tokens (which I understand to be a string) and I noticed it in the URL,but I would like to know: </p>

<ol>
<li>what is the purpose of the token?</li>
<li>how to generate it?</li>
<li>do I have to update it in the database when the user has logged out ? </li>
<li>Is it a good practice to create a cookie with the token and check against it? </li>
</ol>

<p>As far as I know users can restrict cookies being created.</p>

<p>...And I was wondering if (for example using ZF2) I would like to restrict the access for user on certain pages if he is not logged in.  I thought I could encapsulate the logic in a service class. What seems pretty redundant is that in each module I want to use the service I would have to do a check something like <code>isUserLoggedIn()</code> and decide what to do 
(if not logged in maybe redirect to the login page) and this doesn't seem very DRY. </p>

When this happens, all the subsequent requests must wait for the job to end (due to the node's architecture):</p>

<pre><code>function proxy(request, response) {
    if(isSpecial(request)) {
        // Long running job
    }
    // Proxy request
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is not good.<br />So let's say that the long running job can be implemented in <strong>Java</strong>, and for this purpose I build a Java server application that executes the long running job in a separate thread every time a request is made by the node application. </p>

<p>So, when the conditions are met, node.js makes a connection (TCP, HTTP, whatever) to the Java server. The Java server initializes a new Thread for the request, executes the long running job in this separate thread, and returns back, let's say, a JSON response (can be binary, whatever) that node can easily, asynchronously, handle:</p>

<pre><code>var javaServer = initJavaServer(); // pseudo-code

function proxy(request, response) {
    var special = isSpecial(request);
    if (special) {
        var jobResponse;
        javaServer.request( ... );
        javaServer.addListener(""data"", function(chunk)) {
            // Read response
            // jobResponse = ...
        }
        javaServer.addListener(""end"", function(jobResult)) {
            doProxy(jobResponse, request, response);
        }
    } else {
        doProxy(null, request, response);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this way, I can execute long running jobs for those request that meet the conditions, without blocking the whole node application.</p>

<p>So here the requirements are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Speed </li>
<li>Scalability of both apps (the node proxy runs on a cluster, and the Java app on another one)</li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe a messaging broker service like RabbitMQ may help (node pushes messages, Java subscribes to them and pushes the response back). </p>

<p>There is also a similar one in Lasse Koskela's book using EasyMock instead of Mockito.</p>

<p>The thing is: what are we really testing in these examples? We are basically telling through mocks what object the query should return, and then asserting that in fact it returned the object we told it to return. </p>

<p>We are not testing if the query is correct or if it returns a different object or no objects at all (or even more than one object). We cannot test if it returns null when the object does not exist in the database. This line</p>

<pre><code>Assert.assertNull(someDao.comeGetSome(4321));
</code></pre>

<p>works because there is no scripted interaction for that argument, not because the object does not exist.</p>

<p>It looks like we are just testing if the method calls the proper methods and objects (em.find).</p>

<p>What is the point of unit testing this? Are there any good frameworks in Java to quickly set up an in memory database and perform tests with it?</p>

<p>Lets say I enter this:</p>

<pre><code>var input1 = prompt(""Hi how are you"");
if(input1 = ""good""){
alert(""That's great!"");
}else if(input1 = ""bad""){
alert(""I hope it perks up!"");
}else{
alert(""Input not recognized"");

<p>When he/she enters it it then assigns it to a variable first, so any code inside itself can't modify itself before that, so any code that modifies itself doing it won't have to worry, then it runs it. After it runs it displays the variable number so they can call it later.</p>

<p>One thing for the variable I might have to have it check to see if it already exists as a variable name, and if it does it recalculates a variable name.</p>

<p>So basically code that saves it to itself in a variable causing itself to grow. </p>

<p>I'm writing a mobile app next which will interact with the server.</p>

<p>My question is : How should the client/server interaction work when node.js forces you to program asynchronously?</p>

<p>For example, let's say the user wants to login, and a post request is sent to my node.js server - is it best practice to keep the connection open somehow whilst node does its thing?  I'm unsure how an anonymous function in a callback for example would be able to send a response back (especially if the context is lost).</p>

<p>OR would you have the server send back an 'OK (I'm working on it)' and then somehow push to the client when ready?</p>

<p>Sorry for the generalities..  As you all know node likes to accept callback functions whenever waiting is involved (Eg/ database call), and I'm still new to this kind of working.</p>

<p>Here's a brief description of the problem:</p>

<p><code>class Card</code> includes, among other stuff, the variables <code>int suit</code> and <code>int value</code> as private data members. I've declared the overloaded operator function as follows:</p>

<p><code>int operator&gt;(const Card&amp; lhs, const Card&amp; rhs);</code></p>

<p>Because it needs to access private data members of <code>class Card</code>, it is declared with the <code>friend</code> qualifier in the class declaration. </p>

<p>The function itself is confirmed to work as described. The real problem lies with providing the two arguments by calling a 'getter' function of the following form:</p>

<pre><code> Card &amp;Node::getCardRef() const{
       Card&amp; ref = *c;
       return ref;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>where the variable <code>c</code> is of type <code>Card *</code> and points to a valid object of type <code>Card</code>. Also, an instance of <code>class Node</code> represents a node in a singly-linked list.</p>

<p>Combining the two functions in the following manner causes a segfault (specifically, in gdb terms ""In Card &amp;Node::getCardRef(): this = 0x0""):</p>

<pre><code> if (node.getCardRef() &gt; node.getNext()-&gt;getCardRef()){   

 /* do wondrous stuff */

  }
</code></pre>

<p>Also, when isolated, <code>Card &amp;Node::getCardRef()</code> seems to produce desired results.</p>

<p>With this particular dataset there will always be this pattern (however, the actual data is has many more entries and columns). I know what I would like for output, but I am not exactly sure how to implement it.</p>

The way I declare my values is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>type FileType int64
const (
    movie FileType = iota
    music
    book
    etc
)
</code></pre>

<p>I use these values in my struct like this:</p>

<pre><code>type File struct {
    Name     string
    Type     FileType
    Size     int64
}
</code></pre>

<p>I use gorp for my database stuff, but I guess the use of gorp isn't relevant to my problem. I put stuff in my DB like this:</p>

<pre><code>dbmap.Insert(&amp;File{""MyBook.pdf"",movie,1000})
</code></pre>

<p>but when I try to retrieve stuff…</p>

<pre><code>dbmap.Select(&amp;dbFiles, ""select * from Files"")
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>panic: reflect.Set: value of type int64 is not assignable to type main.FileType
</code></pre>

<p>When I use <code>int64</code> as the type for the <code>const(...)</code> and for the <code>File.Type</code> field, everything works fine, but I'm new to Go and want to understand the problem.
The way I see it, I have two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why can't Go convert this stuff successfully? I looked at the source code of the Go reflection and sql packages and there are methods for this kind of conversion, but they seem to fail. Is this a bug? What is the problem?</li>
<li><p>I figured out, that one can implement the <code>sql.Scanner</code> interface by implementing the following method:</p>

<pre><code>Scan(src interface{}) error
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to implement the method and I even was able to get the right value from <code>src</code> and convert it to a <code>FileType</code>, but I was confused if I should implement the method for ""<code>(f *FileType)</code> or <code>(f FileType)</code>. Either way the method gets invoked, however I'm not able to overwrite <code>f</code> (or at least the update gets lost later) and the <code>File</code> instances read from the DB always had a ""0"" as value for <code>File.Type</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Do you have any ideas on those two points?</p>

The web app design has a separate action class for each web page and has all the action mappings as expected in the struts-config.xml.
There also exists a 'BaseAction' class that extends from 'Action' in our web app and we have made all the remaining actions in our web app to extend from this base action. This BaseAction class does not have an execute method.</p>

<p>I want to include a simple java method, say, <code>checkOfficeHours</code>, that checks for the office hours each time when a page is rendered. That is, I want this method to be executed each time an action is invoked.</p>

<p>And also this method will set a request attribute for my jsp to use.</p>

<p>So its a common piece of code for all the actions but I do not wish to write the same method in all the java classes. Is there a way by which I can code this method in the BaseAction class and it automatically gets executed by each action by itself, without having to explicitly call it from each action class?</p>

<p>Can I use the <code>setToken(HTTPServletRequest)</code> method to do this? I have been searching on the internet but could not find much with struts 1.3.</p>

<p>Any inputs will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>You can reserve more than you need when creating a mesh</p>

<pre><code>mesh = new Mesh(false, 100, 0, new VertexAttribute(Usage.Position, 3, ""a_position""));
</code></pre>

<p>But there is no method for adding a vertex. You can get the FloatBuffer and add to that, but I get strange results. I also tried the mesh.setVertices with offset but that does not work either.</p>

<p>I debugged with drawing points. Works until I try adding a vertex by any means (even if I tweak offsets to account for 3 floats in one vertex)</p>

<p>Copied code segment:</p>

<pre><code>mesh.setVertices(new float[] {
                -0.5f, -0.5f, 0,
                0.5f, -0.5f, 0/*,
                -0.5f,0.5f,0.f*/});//works if I uncoment this
mesh.setVertices(new float[]{-0.5f,0.5f,0.f}, 6, 3);//but comment this out
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried</p>

<pre><code>squareMesh.setVertices(new float[]{-0.5f,0.5f,0.f}, 2, 3);

Now, in the case that a user wanted to save the name, I will have a second button that will call a PHP mail action to email the name.  Before I add the mail function, I'm just trying to store the variable somewhere so that I can alert it and validate that I have control over it.  In the following code $field2 is the name which is located by $id_num which equals $search_str.  I then try and assign $field2 to the global variable $nameContainer:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
&lt;?
$nameContainer = ""Mary"";
?&gt;

&lt;? 
function loadName() {
global $nameContainer;
if(!empty($_POST['act'])) {
    $lineNum = rand(1, 5189);
    $search_str = $lineNum; 
    $lines = file('names_girls_5189_origin.csv'); 
    foreach($lines as $line){ 
        list($id_num, $field2, $field3, $field4)=explode("","",$line); 
        $nameContainer = ($id_num == $search_str) ? ""$field2"" : """";
        echo ($id_num == $search_str) ? 
            ""&lt;table style= 'height: 100%;'&gt;
            &lt;tr style='width: 100%; height= '200px';'&gt;

            &lt;center&gt;&lt;span class='myText' style='color: white; font-size: 48px;'&gt;$field2&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span style='color: #E8C8D5; font-size: 36px'&gt;Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;span class='myText' style='color: #2E7B4D; font-size: 24px;'&gt;Origin: $field3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;span class='myText' style='color: #2E7B4D; font-size: 24px;'&gt;Meaning: $field4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
            &lt;/table&gt;"" : """"; 
    }
}
}
loadName();

?&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

<p>It appears my problem stems from $nameContainer = ($id_num == $search_str) ? ""$field2"" : """"; because $nameContainer = $field2; works but assigns the very last name in the csv rather than the one that matches the search string.  I realize there's probably some basic logic I'm missing here, so any help is appreciated! </p>

I try different way but it never works. My website use bootstrap.</p>

<p>Here is my code for the heatmap:</p>

      width = 960- margin.left - margin.right,

      var colorScale = d3.scale.quantile()
          .domain([0, 9, d3.max(data,function(d){ return d.value; })])
          .range(colors);

      var tip = d3.tip()
                  .attr('class', 'd3-tip')
                  .style(""visibility"",""visible"")

<p>To make it responsive i try to make the value of width and height in percentage but with no success.</p>

<p>I also try this code:</p>

<pre><code>function responsivefy(svg) {
          var container = d3.select(svg.node().parentNode),
              width = parseInt(svg.style(""width"")),
              height = parseInt(svg.style(""height"")),
              aspect = width / height;

          svg.attr(""viewBox"", ""0 0 "" + width + "" "" + height)
              .attr(""perserveAspectRatio"", ""xMinYMid"")
              .call(resize);

          d3.select(window).on(""resize."" + container.attr(""id""), resize);

          function resize() {
              var targetWidth = parseInt(container.style(""width""));
              svg.attr(""width"", targetWidth);
              svg.attr(""height"", Math.round(targetWidth / aspect));
          }
      }
</code></pre>

<p>Which doesn't work with bootstrap.</p>

<p>Then I try this:</p>

<pre><code>  $(window).resize(function () {
             var w = $(""#chart"").width();
             svg.attr(""width"", w);
             svg.attr(""height"", w * height / width);
         });
</code></pre>

<p>I don't have any solution by now. Does nayone know how to do? thanks</p>

<p>... which I copied from the internet. When I tested it, Firefox said that my browser supports websocket feature but it DOESN'T ESTABLISH CONNECTION TO MY SERVER. I try to telnet our server in port 80 and I could gain connection to it. But if I am to use websocket connection in my page,it does not establish connection anymore.</p>

<p>Thank you very much in advance for any inputs/help.</p>

<p>[EDIT]
** by the way, does "".../echo"" in my specified websocket connection has to do something with it? I mean, do I have to have some echo.php in my server?</p>

<pre><code>private void CreateUCBbtn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
     MainForm f1 = new MainForm();
     f1 = (MainForm)this.Parent.Parent;
     f1.AddUCBlueIntoPanel2();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what I want to do is after user click the 'Change UCB Label' button, the label in UserControlBlue will change accordingly to what has been entered in textbox in UserControlRed. So, I have two questions here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Regarding my <strong>Note</strong> above, is it safe to do it like this?</li>
<li>What is the best way for me to pass the value in the textbox from UserControlRed into the label in UserControlBlue?</li>
</ol>

<p>Another note: I'm still new in OOP and especially C# and winforms. Maybe anyone can suggest me a good site to familiar with?</p>

<p>How to use inner join in Hibernate?</p>

<p>Any Suggestions!!</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for all answerers,
I tried what you told and it returns a empty list. </p>

<p>To, test i set the 'userName=Tamil' which is in the table. 
The query generated by Hibernate is looks like below,</p>

<p><code>select expens0_.expnsId as expnsId1_, expens0_.catId as catId1_, expens0_.category_catId as category7_1_, expens0_.userName as userName1_ from Expens expens0_ inner join Category category1_ on expens0_.category_catId=category1_.catId where expens0_.userName=?</code></p>

<p>As a beginner, i have some doubts in JPQL, I want <code>catName</code> from <code>Category[catId, catName]</code> table. And the <code>catId</code> is also available in <code>Expens[expnsId, catId, userName]</code>. </p>

<p>By adding the below lines in Expens.java class, how it will give me <code>catName</code> along with the other variables in the <code>Expens</code> table. </p>

<pre><code>@ManyToOne
private Category category

// getters, setters
</code></pre>

<p>I cant able to understand it. Without understanding this i cant move further, i have to give more mappings in my project. If clear with this mapping, i can move to the rest with confidence.</p>

<p>The query i used is pascal's version: <code>Query query = hSession.createQuery(""SELECT e FROM Expens e JOIN e.category c WHERE e.userName = :userName"").setParameter(""userName"", userName);</code></p>

<p>For me, the query generated by hibernate is looks like same as my Old SQl query. I cant able to find problem here.</p>

<p>I mean, assuming that the accelerometer is giving me somenting like (Ax,Ay,Az) -<a href=""http://www.anddev.org/novice-tutorials-f8/acceleration-orientation-visual-reference-t11818.html"" rel=""nofollow"">in device's coordinates</a>-, what transformations should I apply to transform the values into (Ax',Ay',Az') -<a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorManager.html#getOrientation%28float%5B%5D,%20float%5B%5D%29"" rel=""nofollow"">in real world's coordinates</a>-, so I can use the acceleration vector in real worlds coordinates to calculate if the device is accelerating north, east, south-west,etc?</p>

<p>I have been working around this issue during the past few days. At first I thought that it shound't be difficult, but after searching dozens of pages I haven't come up with anything functional.</p>

<p>By the way, here is some code with what I've implemented so far:</p>

<pre><code>    private SensorEventListener mSensorEventListener = new SensorEventListener() {

    public void onAccuracyChanged(Sensor sensor, int accuracy){
}

    public void onSensorChanged(SensorEvent event) {
        switch(event.sensor.getType()){
        case Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER:
            accelerometervalues = event.values.clone();
            AX.setText(accelerometervalues[0]+"""");
            AY.setText(accelerometervalues[1]+"""");
            AZ.setText(accelerometervalues[2]+"""");
            break;
        case Sensor.TYPE_ORIENTATION:
            orientationvalues = event.values.clone();
            azimuth.setText(orientationvalues[0]+"""");
            pitch.setText(orientationvalues[1]+"""");
            roll.setText(orientationvalues[2]+"""");
            break;
        case Sensor.TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD:
            geomagneticmatrix =event.values.clone();
            TAX.setText(geomagneticmatrix[0]+"""");
            TAY.setText(geomagneticmatrix[1]+"""");
            TAZ.setText(geomagneticmatrix[2]+"""");
            break;
        }
        if (geomagneticmatrix != null &amp;&amp; accelerometervalues != null) {
            float[] R = new float[16];
            float[] I = new float[16];
            SensorManager.getRotationMatrix(R, I, accelerometervalues, geomagneticmatrix);
            //What should I do here to transform the components of accelerometervalues into real world acceleration components??
        }
   }
};
</code></pre>

<p>I have:</p>

<p>A vector of accelerations in native coordinates in <code>accelerometervalues</code>.</p>

<p>A vector of magnetic field values in <code>geomagneticmatrix</code>.</p>

<p>Azimuth, pitch and roll in <code>orientationvalues</code>.</p>

<p>Rotation matrix <code>R</code>.
Inclination matrix <code>I</code>.</p>

<p>I think all the necessary information is there, azimuth, pitch and roll should describe the displacement of the device's coordinate system in relation with the real world coordinate system. Also, I believe that <code>R</code> is/can even be used as a true north vector inside the devices coordinates.</p>

<p>It seems to me that obtaing the values of acceleration in real world is just a mathematical transformation away from those data. I just can't figure it out.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Edited:</p>

<p>I have tried directly multipliying the components of <code>accelerometervalues</code> with the rotation matrix <code>R</code> (trueaccel=accel*R) but it didn't work. </p>

<pre><code>                    trueacceleration[0]= accelerometervalues[0]*R[0]+accelerometervalues[1]*R[1]+accelerometervalues[2]*R[2];
                trueacceleration[1]= accelerometervalues[0]*R[1]+accelerometervalues[1]*R[4]+accelerometervalues[2]*R[7];
                trueacceleration[2]= accelerometervalues[0]*R[2]+accelerometervalues[1]*R[5]+accelerometervalues[2]*R[8];
</code></pre>

<p>I have also tried multipliying <code>accelerometervalues</code> with the inclination matrix I. Also multipliying with both R and I (trueaccel=accel*R*I) and that didn't work either. Neither does calling to <code>remapcoordinates()</code> and then multiply in any of the previous forms.</p>

<p>Does anybody have an idea about what am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Maybe can someone enlighten me, what I'm doing wrong. This is first time, that I'm using BackgroundWorker. I have no idea, how
to achieve ""search as you type"" with combobox in any other way, because my datatable with addresses is quite large (million records).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any kind of help or code example.</p>

<p>Edit 1:
Ok, here is my code, before I have used BackGroundWorker. It worked, but it searches very very slow (it can take up to 10 seconds):</p>

Anyways, I made a code that finds the roots of a polynomial using the Bisection method. I thought the program was all well and dandy until I pasted it from notepad++ to command prompt, where I ended up getting a bunch of ""class, interface, or enum expected"" errors after compiling it using javac. Everything seems fine in the code itself, so I've deduced that I've made one of the following two errors: either something wrong occurred while I was copying and pasting into command prompt, or I actually did create an error in my code that I didn't catch. Could someone tell me just what I did wrong? It may be a minor fix, but I just don't know how to change it to get my code to work. Here's the code:</p>

        ""particle system doesn't know what texture to load. Make "" +

</code></pre>

<p>ReSharper says to make this value a constant rather than redeclaring it every time. However, this string value is only used in this function, so making it a member variable should not be necessary. Ideally, the variable's scope should be limited to this function. Right?</p>

<p>Also, I agree with whoever is about to say ""place the string in a resource file."" In this case that would most likely be the optimal solution. Not only does it solve localization issues but it also saves the variable from being re-initialized every function call and no longer clutters up the source file. However, this is just an example.</p>

<p>I know many are probably going to say something along the lines of ""premature optimization is the root of all evil"" but please note this is just an example. What if this quasi-constant variable was complex and re-initializing it every call would cause a noticeable slowdown?</p>

<p>Visual Basic .NET allows the programmer to declare variables in a function as static. For example, in this code <code>TestFunction</code> will only be called the first time I click the button:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
    Static example As Integer = TestFunction()

    MessageBox.Show(example)
End Sub

Private Function TestFunction() As Integer
    Console.WriteLine(""Method Accessed"")

    Return 5
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I know C# does not allow this. Is there any particular reason why? It seems like it would be perfect in this situation. It limits the variables scope to the function and only initializes it the first time around. Even if object creation is costly it will only be performed once. So why is this not available? Or is it?</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>When I am building the form dynamically, I insert the file input element as a child of the form:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""file"" id=""file-select-input"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... and I had something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form enctype=""multipart/form-data"" id=""file-select-form"" target=""select-file-iframe"" method=""POST"" action=""/upload/""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""file-select-button"" class=""""&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;iframe style=""display: none"" id=""select-file-iframe"" src=""javascript:false;"" name=""select-file-iframe""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It turns out that when I submit the above form, the input file information was not being sent. The reason for this, is that I didn't have the <code>name</code> attribute specified on the file input element. So when I changed it to this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""file"" id=""file-select-input"" name=""file"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... things worked.</p>

<p>So why does the <code>name</code> attribute of an file input element need to be set for a file to be uploaded? According to the W3C specs, the <code>name</code> attribute assigns the control name, but what is the control name? Why is it important?</p>

<p>A quick background: when importing my music library (formerly organized by iTunes) to Banshee, all of the files were duplicated to fit Banshee's number style (ex: 02.  instead of 02 ) on top of that, iTunes apparently did not save the ID3 tags to the files, so many of them are blank. So now I've got a few thousand tags to fix and duplicate files to get rid of.</p>

<p>To automate the process, I started learning to write bash scripts. I came up with a script (which <a href=""http://pastebin.com/GjdPA4gf"" rel=""nofollow"">you can see here</a>) that does four things: removes unnecessary iTunes files, takes input from user about ID3 Tag information and stores it in variables, clears any present tag info from all files, writes new tags with info taken from user, using a program called eyeD3.</p>

<p>Now, here's where I run into my problem. This script is basically blindly writing info to all mp3 files in the dir. This is fine for tags that all the files have in common - like artist, album, total tracks, year, etc. But I can't tag each individual track number with this method. So I'm still editing the track# tags one at a time, manually. And that's something I really don't want to do 2,000+ times.</p>

<p>The files names all look like this:</p>

<pre><code>01. song1.mp3
02. song2.mp3
03. song3.mp3
</code></pre>

<p>The command to write a track number to a tag looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ eyeD3 -n 1 ""01. song1.mpg""
</code></pre>

<p>So... I'm not sure how to go about automating this. I need to grab the first two digits of each file name, store them somewhere, then recall each one into a separate eyeD3 command.</p>

i created a text view in the top of screen to display the user name which has been retrieved from the users table in the database, also a toast should appear holding the user name saying ""welcome + username"" and then continue to the next page. or if there is exception it gives ""Exception: + the exception""
the problem is that when i enter the email and password the text view do display the user name. but the toast give ""exception: length=0; index=0"" and so it doesn't continue to the next page.</p>

<p>sorry for long typing. but i need to know what is the problem.</p>

And it seemed to me that the natural approach is to pick some MVC framework like Rails, .NET MVC or Django. I've already had experience with both Rails and .NET but not with Python. And as far as my personal testing have shown C# with .NET MVC3 in most cases outperforms the Ruby on Rails 3 (for Rails I've used the unicorn and nginx for the http stuff). Anyone have some observations on that, or was my tests incorrectly held? Any examples with numbers and explanations would be highly appreciated. Thank you!</p>

In the click event handler for the search button (on the client side), I am calling a function which logs the search term by making an AJAX request. I then load the search results page. The request to load the search results page is not made until the AJAX request to log the search term finishes. How can I speed it up? Can I suppress the callback for AJAX complete event? </p>

<p>In my bean's action method, I am trying to retrieve the cookies obtained from the server, using the following code.</p>

<pre><code>FacesContext ctx = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();
Map cookieMap = ctx.getExternalContext().getRequestCookieMap();
</code></pre>

<p>To my knowledge, I know that we get one cookie i.e., JSESSIONID. I have checked with some servers using the below code.</p>

<pre><code>if (cookieMap != null &amp;&amp; !cookieMap.isEmpty()) {
            Iterator iterator = cookieMap.keySet().iterator();
            while (iterator.hasNext()) {
                Cookie cookie = (Cookie) cookieMap
                        .get((String) iterator.next());
                System.out.printf(""Cookie get name %s, cookie get value %s "",
                        cookie.getName(), cookie.getValue());
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Below are the results captured from different servers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>VMware vFabric tc Server Developer Edition</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>output : Cookie get name JSESSIONID, cookie get value 3B88AE51A991800566A4C3A05AC36C37

<p>Based on the above statistics, I have coded in the following way to pass cookie to the url connection method as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>private void openConnection(URL url, Cookie jsessionid){
    HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
    conn.disconnect();
    conn.setUseCaches(false);
    conn.setDefaultUseCaches(false);
    conn.setDoOutput(true);
    if (jsessionid != null) {
        conn.addRequestProperty(""Cookie"", jsessionid.getName() + ""=""
                + jsessionid.getValue());
    }
    conn.connect();
    //some other code
}
</code></pre>

<p>A senior developer improved the above code snippet by iteratively adding cookies from the cookieMap to the RequestProperty as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>if(cookieMap !=null &amp;&amp; !cookieMap.isEmpty()){
    Iterator iterator = cookieMap.keySet().iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
          Cookie cookie = (Cookie) cookieMap.get((String)iterator.next());
          conn.addRequestProperty(""Cookie"",
                      cookie.getName() + ""="" + cookie.getValue());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't try this with other application servers but I guess, other application servers like Weblogic, GlassFish, would also give the same output, i.e.., 1 cookie with name JSESSIONID. Correct me if I am wrong. I would like to know if the number of cookies obtained from the a container is 1 or more. </p>

There is a <code>monitor</code> module which pings each of these engines to check if the engine is responding or not using the <code>ping</code> command. The monitor will run in a loop issuing the <code>ping</code> command every <code>ping interval</code> . The issue is each of these engines has a separate <code>ping interval</code>.
Right now I'm using threaded approach. There is a separate thread created for each engine and each will issue the <code>ping</code> command based on the engine's <code>ping interval</code>. But this seems like a huge overhead to perform a simple task. Also since a lot of engines can be registered, the thread count can easily grow exponentially. Can anyone suggest a better approach to this?</p>

<p>Now I have createed the archive to submit to iTunes App Store accidentally with this provisioning profile - instead of a distribution provisioning profile</p>

<p>(the code signing identity is still a distribution one)</p>

<p>What does that mean?
Is this a problem?
Will only those users be able to install the app and run it that are in the ad hoc provisioning profile?</p>

<p>So basically do I need to reject the binary before its too late - I have been waiting long time now and do not want to resubmit if its not necessary</p>

<p>I am following master-detail pattern in my app. Master fragment (<code>MyRecyclerFragment</code> / <code>MyListFragment</code>) shows a list of textviews. When user clicks on any of those textviews, details fragment (<code>MyDetailsFragment</code>) is launched. Details fragment has the title (same as the one on which user had clicked).</p>

<p>I am trying to achieve the following transition effect:</p>

<ul>
<li>Explode transition for exiting views</li>
<li>Fade transition for appearing views</li>
<li>Move / Translation transition for the TextView which is shared between those 2 fragments</li>
</ul>

<p>Issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>The shared TextView disappears when the transition starts. But the shared transition miraculously works if the first item of the list is clicked.</li>
<li>Transition works if details layout is changed. Please see <code>details.xml</code>. If I remove FrameLayout <code>title_bar</code> completely and put TextView <code>title</code> as a direct child of root LinearLayout, shared element transition works perfectly.</li>
<li>It seems like epicentre gets changed for shared element <em>return</em> transition. For example, if I click on 7th TextView in the list, exit transition (explode) takes that TextView as epicentre. All the TextViews above it slide up and the TextViews below it slide down. But while returning from details fragment to master fragment, epicentre for the return transition is not the TextView which was clicked. </li>
</ul>

I want to have a folder that is called 'graphics' that will contain the graphics with predefined names (e.g.: background.jpeg, enemy.jpeg, etc) and another one that is called 'sound' with corresponding files. Is it possible when i make build the project, the Flash to read from these folders in order to take the appropriate information? I don't want to remove/add from library all the time (i know it can be done that way) so i was thinking like a configuration file that will instruct the Flash program to fetch its graphics and sounds from predefined folders. I don't know if i put it right (cause english is not my native language), but is it possible?
   If it is possible, then can i make an array inside Flash that will not have predefined size, but it will be specified by the elements of these folders (graphics, sounds) ?
   The program will be loaded on a server from where anyone can downloaded, but i don't want to transfer the graphics/sounds via a Loader through Internet. I would like to build them into SWF at build time, but without using the library. Is it possible?</p>

I have a resizable LWJGL (OpenGL) window. The game I'm making is in 2D, but I use glFrustum() to get depth for my sprites. Here's a (little bit simplified) snippet from my projection code:</p>

<pre><code>double divider = 64.0;
double left = -vw / divider;
double right = vw / divider;
double bottom = vh / divider;
double top = -vh / divider;

glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
glLoadIdentity();
glFrustum(left * aspect, right * aspect, bottom, top, 8, 65536);

float zModifier = -256;
float vRatio = Game.HEIGHT / Display.getHeight();

glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
glLoadIdentity();
glTranslatef(-vw / 2.0f, -vh / 2.0f, zModifier * vRatio);
</code></pre>

<p>(I must admit that I don't understand the frustum bit very well, I found this piece of code somewhere in the Internet and it has served me well...)</p>

<p>However, I am rendering my own cursor with a sprite, and switch to native cursor when the cursor comes in contact with the window border. This worked all well until I made the window resizable.</p>

<p>Now my problem is, when I resize the window, the native cursor is ""out of sync"" with the sprite cursor relative to the <code>vRatio</code>. It ""jumps"" a bit, or a bit more, depending of the resized window size.</p>

<p>When the sprite cursor comes in contact with border, I do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hide the sprite cursor</li>
<li>Show the native cursor</li>
<li>Set the native cursor's location to sprite cursor's location <em>(this does not work correctly anymore)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>I feel like there's a simple math solution to this but I cannot figure it out (I've tried things... but..).</p>

<p>I hope my question isn't too vague, and that I provided enough information!</p>

<p>I have a custom model form to edit a Destination object, and I in the constructor I get hold of a queryset from a related Visitor model, which has ManyToMany field into Destination(see EDIT for the reason to use a custom model form)</p>

<pre><code>    print ""loading initial choices""
    visitor_choices, visitor_initial = [], []
    visitor_set = self.instance.visitor_set.all()
    print visitor_set
    for obj in Visitor.objects.all():
        visitor_choices.append((obj.pk, obj.name))
        #if visitor_set.filter(pk=obj.pk # this hits the db every time!
        if obj in visitor_set:
            visitor_initial.append(obj.pk)

    self.fields['visitors'].choices = visitor_choices
    self.fields['visitors'].initial = visitor_initial

    print ""finished loading initial choices""
</code></pre>

<p>The idea was to load the related visitor_set into a variable, to avoid repeated queries to check if each visitor is present in the visitor_set. Is this the best approach? </p>

<p>Also, if I switch on db logging (as explained in this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2314920/django-show-log-orm-sql-calls-from-python-shell"">question</a>, second answer), I can see a repeated query (the 3rd SELECT statement) to select all visitors for destination id 1, but this is nowhere in the code I wrote, where does it come from?</p>

<pre><code>loading initial choices
(0.000) SELECT ""testapp_visitor"".""id"", ""testapp_visitor"".""name"" FROM ""testapp_visitor"" INNER JOIN ""testapp_visitor_destinations"" ON (""testapp_visitor"".""id"" = ""testapp_visitor_destinations"".""visitor_id"") WHERE ""testapp_visitor_destinations"".""destination_id"" = 1  LIMIT 21; args=(1,
)
[&lt;Visitor: MIMA&gt;, &lt;Visitor: MIMO&gt;, &lt;Visitor: MIMU&gt;]
(0.000) SELECT ""testapp_visitor"".""id"", ""testapp_visitor"".""name"" FROM ""testapp_visitor""; args=()
(0.000) SELECT ""testapp_visitor"".""id"", ""testapp_visitor"".""name"" FROM ""testapp_visitor"" INNER JOIN ""testapp_visitor_destinations"" ON (""testapp_visitor"".""id"" = ""testapp_visitor_destinations"".""visitor_id"") WHERE ""testapp_visitor_destinations"".""destination_id"" = 1 ; args=(1,)
finished loading initial choices
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>The <code>Destination</code> object I refer to is the related side of a <code>ManyToMany</code> field on a <code>Visitor</code> object. If my form was editing the Visitor object itself then Django would handle the <code>ManyToMany</code> field automatically. But to do that on the model form for <code>Destination</code> I need to add a multiple choice field for <code>Visitor</code> and customize the <code>__init__</code> method to load the choices and initial selections for it.</p>

<p>The question however is about how to handle the queryset, and the mysterious 2nd sql to load the manytomany values, which I can also see from the shell:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from testapp.forms import DestinationForm
&gt;&gt;&gt; from testapp.models import Destination, Visitor
&gt;&gt;&gt; dest = Destination.objects.get(pk=1)
(0.001) SELECT ""testapp_destination"".""id"", ""testapp_destination"".""destination"" FROM ""testapp_destination"" WHERE ""testapp_destination"".""id"" =
 1 ; args=(1,)
&gt;&gt;&gt; destinationForm = DestinationForm(instance=dest)
loading initial choices
(0.000) SELECT ""testapp_visitor"".""id"", ""testapp_visitor"".""name"" FROM ""testapp_visitor"" INNER JOIN ""testapp_visitor_destinations"" ON (""testap
p_visitor"".""id"" = ""testapp_visitor_destinations"".""visitor_id"") WHERE ""testapp_visitor_destinations"".""destination_id"" = 1  LIMIT 21; args=(1,
)
[&lt;Visitor: MIMA&gt;, &lt;Visitor: MIMO&gt;, &lt;Visitor: MIMU&gt;]
(0.000) SELECT ""testapp_visitor"".""id"", ""testapp_visitor"".""name"" FROM ""testapp_visitor""; args=()
(0.000) SELECT ""testapp_visitor"".""id"", ""testapp_visitor"".""name"" FROM ""testapp_visitor"" INNER JOIN ""testapp_visitor_destinations"" ON (""testap
p_visitor"".""id"" = ""testapp_visitor_destinations"".""visitor_id"") WHERE ""testapp_visitor_destinations"".""destination_id"" = 1 ; args=(1,)

when this textView is small my touchEvent work until i get text so big, than the scrollBar is needed. Then all touch event get overrided and You can only scroll textView. No TouchEvent is called.</p>

<ul>
<li>I have an Application where Users post Entities (<code>BaseEntity</code>).</li>
<li>The <code>BaseEntity</code> has the property <code>$cagetory</code></li>
<li>Depending on <code>$category</code> the Entity however has to have additional Properties</li>
</ul>

<p>Ab simple Example:</p>

<pre><code>class BaseEntity {
    protected $id;
    protected $title;
    protected $description;
}

class MovieEntity {
    protected $id;
    protected $title;
    protected $description;
    protected $airingDateStart; // new property
    protected $airingDateEnd;   // new property
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now i could easily do a two-step formular where a user first chooses his Category and depending on that the EntityClass will be chosen - but i can't have that. But that's no good because what if the User put up a Movie in the <code>BaseEntity</code>-Category and then later wants to change the Entity into <code>MovieEntity</code>? So that idea isn't really a safe option.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Requirements</strong> (to make stuff more complicated)</p>

<ul>
<li>The Categories as well as Entities have to be controlled by Doctrine</li>
<li>Each <code>Category</code> is provided to the application via a single <code>Module</code></li>
<li>Modules need to be placed into the application without much configuration needed (at max one DB-Query to populate the <code>CategoryTable</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What i did so far</strong></p>

<p>At first i have chosen to run with Doctrines functionality <strong>Single Table Inheritance</strong>. This allowed me to easily do things like <code>MovieEntity extends BaseEntity</code> and things work like a charm for adding new Entities to the Database. But the main Problem remains: what if the user changes the Category, it would change the EntityClass and that's pretty much a No-Go.</p>

<p>I mean yes, i could potentionally do things my current way and on the change of category manually modify the <code>DiscriminatorColumn</code> but that's so freaking dirty. </p>

<p>Another alternate approach would be that on the event of changing the category, a NEW Entity will be created and the old one would be destroyed, but that feels kind of dirty, too.</p>

<p>All in all i think I'm headed into the wrong direction. There may be a development-pattern that i don't know about that makes all my hard work look like a waste and things turn out super easy in the end, but it appears I'm overlooking stuff.</p>

<p>To maybe get a closer Idea of what I'm up for, you may have a look at my application on GitHub:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/manuakasam/DuitMarketplace"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>DuitMarketplace</strong></a> - this is the main application with a base-category, all the controllers, etc... The <a href=""https://github.com/manuakasam/DuitMarketplace/blob/master/src/DuitMarketplace/Controller/ItemController.php#L129-L209"" rel=""nofollow""><code>ItemController#editAction()</code></a> may provide some more clues as to how i intend to automade some things.</li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/manuakasam/DuitMarketplaceItemVehicle"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>DuitMarketplaceItemVehicle</strong></a> - a category that get's dropped into the mainapp</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks in advance for all the feedback i may get. I fully realize that this question is probably borderline between an existance on SO vs programmers.stackexchange, but i chose to have it here after all.</p>

"14248400","1","","","2013-01-09 23:33:38","","0","792","<p>I needed a domain class that held a list of <code>Strings</code>.  It seems fairly well-known that GORM can't handle this, so I've worked around it.  At first I tried using getters and setters in the domain class, but that caused problems.  Then I found on Stack Overflow a way to use <code>afterLoad()</code> and <code>beforeValidate()</code> to rewrite properties as shown below.  This has worked well to allow me to turn the <code>List</code> into a <code>String</code> for persistence and back to a <code>List</code> for use in the app.</p>

<pre><code>    class Entries {
        // persisted to database
        String _entry

        // exposed to app
        List entry

        static transients = ['entry']   //don't try to persist the List

        def afterLoad() {
                            // split the String from the database into a List
            entry = _entry?.split('\\|')
        }

        def beforeValidate() {
                            // join the List into a String for persisting
            _entry = entry.join('|')
        }

        static constraints = {
            _entry maxSize:4000
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine programmatically.  The only problem is that the Grails scaffolding can't deal with this, even if I try to enter a pipe-delimited string.  I understand the reason why is that the scaffolding creates a form field for <code>_entry</code>, so <code>entry</code> is null when it tries to save the object.  And <code>beforeValidate()</code> relies on a List of Strings to work.</p>

<p>I tried to get around this in the controller, by setting <code>params.entry = params._entry</code>, prior to the call to <code>new Entries(params)</code>.  [I recognize that this is not a perfect solution, but this was my first pass at getting the form working.]  And then I added a test in <code>beforeValidate()</code> to set <code>entry = _entry</code> if <code>entry</code> was <code>null</code>.  Basically:</p>

<p>EntriesController.groovy:</p>

<pre><code>params.entry = params._entry    // I added this line
def entriesInstance = new Entries(params)
</code></pre>

<p>Entries.groovy:</p>

<pre><code>    def beforeValidate() {
        if( entry == null ) entry = _entry    // I added this line
        _entry = entry.join('|')
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I thought that would allow me to enter pipe-delimited strings into the scaffolded Create Entries form and get <em>something</em> into the database.</p>

<p>To my surprise, though, I found that both <code>entry</code> and <code>_entry</code> were <code>null</code> in <code>beforeValidate()</code>, even though I printed and verified that <code>params</code> contained both keys in the controller.  I don't understand why this happens.  How did my adding a new key to <code>params</code> result in nulls arriving in the domain class?</p>

<p>The follow-up question is, of course, what's the right way to make the scaffolded Create Entries form accept a pipe-delimited String that makes it into the database?</p>

<p>So, let assume now we want to extend reading/writing functional via creating some class (lets call it BackUp) and somehow make <em>ifstream</em> and <em>ofstream</em> to use BackUp's reading/writing instead (only). As far as I understood this principle is called acquaintance? </p>

<p>The main difference should be that when opening a file a copy of it should be created somewhere. Then we work with this starting file like usually, we overwrite it by our results and if the procedure was successful only then the temporary copy is deleted.</p>

I have followed all the necessary steps correctly (I guess) that are described here <a href=""http://wiki.magmi.org/index.php?title=Configurable_Item_processor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.magmi.org/index.php?title=Configurable_Item_processor</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a <strong>test file</strong> with data that I load in the importer <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17_fWYfYmSiXdLYp80P0kafPrFYzwzp7JHGNlHQTM0S4/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17_fWYfYmSiXdLYp80P0kafPrFYzwzp7JHGNlHQTM0S4/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p><strong>Test cases:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Running the import <strong>without</strong> <em>Configurable Item processor</em> works just fine but does not create the link between the simple products and the configurable ones in backend (which makes perfect sense).</p></li>
<li><p>Running <strong>with</strong> <em>Configurable Item processor</em> with all the combinations of plugin options (<em>Perform simples/configurable link</em> y/n &amp; <em>auto match simples skus before configurable</em> y/n) yields all the time the fallowing errors:</p>

<p>1 SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1048 Column 'attribute_id' cannot be null -</p>

<p>2 SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1048 Column 'attribute_id' cannot be null - ERROR ON RECORD #3</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The error is triggered by this line of code </p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO `catalog_product_super_attribute` (`product_id`,`attribute_id`,`position`) VALUES (?,?,?)
</code></pre>

<p>that you can find in <em>/plugins/base/itemprocessors/configurables/magmi_configurableprocessor.php:246</em></p>

<p>I have searched for a solution and found this one <a href=""http://blog.mdnsolutions.com/index.php/magmi-not-importing-configurable-products/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mdnsolutions.com/index.php/magmi-not-importing-configurable-products/</a> where actually the guy solved the issue by replacing that line above with:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO `catalog_product_super_attribute` (`product_id`,`attribute_id`,`position`) VALUES (:a,:b,:c)
</code></pre>

<p>It is not working.</p>

<p>There is also another question on this issue posted here <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12056424/magmi-configurable-products-importation"">Magmi Configurable Products Importation</a> however the solution appears to be very ""vague"".</p>

class D : public B { public: D* getSelf() {return static_cast&lt;D*&gt;(this);} };

Moreover, I was able to run 'telnet mydnshostname 8020' and successfully open a connection, indicating this socket was correctly listening despite its conspicuous absence from netstat's list.</p>

<p>This is the first time I've noticed an open socket not appearing in netstat's list.  Is it because Hadoop Namenode communication is based on a proprietary <a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ipc"" rel=""nofollow"">IPC protocol</a>?  This protocol seems to be TCP-based, so I don't understand why it's not showing up.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

To keep things as simple as possible, I am trying to deploy the default MVC 4 template that is generated by VS 2012 Express for web. I created a new project - an  Azure cloud service. I selected an MVC 4 web role. And that creates a nice little asp.net application with home, about and contact pages, and links to register and login. I just want to deploy this site to Azure and see it work on the cloud. </p>

<p>However the membership does not appear to work on azure. The pages of the application appear correct. However when I click the 'Register' link it does not take me to a page to nter a new username and password. I do not believe the membership tables are being generated anywhere either.  </p>

<p>Considering how simple this is, I think I must be making a silly mistake somewhere. I would really appreciate if someone could help me with this.</p>

<p>Also, for the record, I have noticed that if I create a stand alone MVC 4 project in VS2012 Express (as opposed to a Windows Azure Cloud service project with an mvc 4 web role) then when I right click that MVC4 project and choose to publish it, it allows me to specify a sql database using a connection string. What is more is once it is published to Azure, the membership works perfectly. I can create useraccounts and log in. If I examine my SQL Azure database using the azure portal, I can see the new membership tables created there. </p>

<p>But when I try to publish a  Windows Azure Cloud service with MVC4 webrole, I do not see any option to provide a connection string of any sort to the azure project. Maybe that is why the membership is not working... since there is no database linked with the web role... but I cannot figure out how to specify this. I was under the impression that publishing a stand alone MVC4 project to Azure, and publishing an Azure Cloud Service with an MVC4 Web Role is the exact same thing, please correct me if I am wrong. And either way, I should be able to see the membership functionality of my mvc 4 web role.</p>

<p>Here are the steps to recreate what I have. Basically it is all default stuff: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new project in VS2012 Express 
File -> New Project -> 'Windows Azure Cloud Service'.</p></li>
<li><p>On the next screen add an ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Role to it. </p></li>
<li><p>On the subsequent screen choose 'Internet Application'.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These 3 steps create a new project. It runs locally just fine.
Now I try to put it on the cloud.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Right click on the windows azure project in solution explorer and choose 'Publish'.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the subscription (I already have certificate/credentials in place to publish to azure from VS so I select that)</p></li>
<li><p>Create a cloud service on the next screen (I name it 'garyazurecloudservice').</p></li>
<li><p>Accept all the default settings in the Publish wizard and click Publish.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The publishing process takes a few minutes. 
The web application can be viewed at <a href=""http://garyazurecloudservice.cloudapp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://garyazurecloudservice.cloudapp.net/</a>.</p>

<p>The Home, About and Contact pages all display correctly. However it I click the 'Register' link at the top right I see a webpage with the correct layout template, but an error in red that says: 
""Error. An error occurred while processing your request.""</p>

<p>I have tried to create an SQL database on Azure but I don't see any way to connect this role to it. Possibly that is the problem? Or maybe it is something else altogether. I would appreciate if anyone can tell me what is wrong. </p>

<p>I have spent the entire day googling and going in circles with no success. Thank you for any help you can provide.

<p>My original question referenced here <a href=""http://datatables.net/forums/discussion/28221/unable-to-stop-initial-sorting#latest"" rel=""nofollow"">Question on datatables forum</a></p>

<p>I want to disable the initial sort that datatables does automatically.</p>

<p>Datatables refuses to listen to</p>

<pre><code>""aaSorting"": []
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>""aaSorting"": [[0,'desc'],[1,'desc']]
</code></pre>

<p>It sorts by the first column in the table in ASC order. The only way to stop this is to use</p>

<pre><code>""bSort"": false
</code></pre>

<p>however that removes all sorting functionality on my table.</p>

<p>My table works 100% for everything else except sorting. Filtering, searching, paging etc works 100%. When I set</p>

<pre><code>""bSort"" : true
</code></pre>

<p>or, when I leave it out, as I believe the default is true, I get the following error in a alert message:</p>

<p>""error"":""An SQL error occurred: SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'ORDER BY column1 ASC LIMIT 0, 10' at line 4""</p>

(ie. unit numbers on each side, and inbetween shows hw name and a color associated with its purpose, ie. server, network device etc)</p>

<p>It worked for a while, but as things expanded I decided to write myself a web interface where I can keep track of IP addresses, hostnames, etc (its all local, so security isn't a big deal as it cant be accessed outside local net) </p>

<p>2 options I am going for, in order of preference:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>a way that based on each hostname (server_id) there is a field for location (ie. can be, rack 1, unit 1 (bottom slot)) some calculations will take these numbers, and input them into the correct slots and label them with whatever I specify as hardware (another field), this is more ideal, as I don't have to manage a spreadsheet + web interface</p></li>
<li><p>on a section of the tool, it will pull the contents from the excel file stored in html/ directory, and would update - say every day in case of changes (can just add a cron entry to run the script daily) - it will display this exactly as is on spreadsheet (its a physical view, so accuracy is important, it can't delete blank cells or anything)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My question is - for option 1, what would need to be done ? (ie. can it be done in php? because it's the only language I know, I'm learnng javascript and java, but not quite there yet, also if can briefly describe the logic in place)</p>

<p>I don't need exact code, as I'd like to be able to figure some things out on my own, since I am still learning.</p>

<p>and for option 2, I know there are some existing functions like excel_reader and stuff, what would be the best way to go about it?</p>

<p>Each customer has the field ""parent_customer"". If the field is set, the account is a subaccount. </p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is add a simple filter to the Grid overview, so that I can show only parent accounts of only subaccounts. </p>

<p>in the overriding Grid.php file I've placed the following snippet into the _prepareColumns() method:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;addColumn('parent_customer', array(
        'header'    =&gt; Mage::helper('customer')-&gt;__('Subaccount'),
        'width'     =&gt; '10',

        'options'   =&gt; array('0'=&gt;'Nein', '1' =&gt; 'Ja'),
        'index'     =&gt; 'parent_customer',
        'filter_condition_callback' =&gt; array($this, '_callbackParentCustomer'),

    ));
</code></pre>

<p>And also added a new callback Method</p>

<pre><code>protected function _callbackParentCustomer($collection, $column){
    $value = $column-&gt;getFilter()-&gt;getValue();
    if ($value === null) { //here check if filter is not null
        return $this;
    }

    /**
     * Here you can add filter to collection
     * or do other manipulations with collection.
     * As example you can check filter value and filter collection.
     */
    if ($value != 0) { 
        Mage::log('show subaccounts', null, 'product.log', true);
        $collection-&gt;addFieldToFilter('parent_customer', array('gt' =&gt; 0));
    }else{
        Mage::log('hide subaccounts', null, 'product.log', true);
        $collection-&gt;addFieldToFilter('parent_customer', array('eq' =&gt; ''));
    }

    return $this;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Logs show, that both filters trigger. If I want to only show subaccounts ('gt' => 0) all works fine. 
Problem is, if I want to show all parent accounts I get an empty collection. Is there no way to filter for Items that don't have an attribute set?</p>

<p>The test case above is a list of data rendered with the <code>ng-repeat</code> directive, twice. Once without using <code>ng-include</code> and once using <code>ng-include</code>.</p>

<p>CSS transitions are setup for all three (<em>enter</em>, <em>leave</em> and <em>move</em>) animations supported by the <code>ng-repeat</code> directive. All three animations work fine when <strong>not</strong> using <code>ng-include</code>, but only the <em>enter</em> animation works when using <code>ng-include</code> to load the template of each item in the list.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure this is a bug with <code>angular-animate</code> but not sure. I might be doing something wrong when using <code>ng-repeat</code> and <code>ng-include</code> combination. I tried digging in the <code>angular-animate</code> source code and fix the problem, but couldn't. All I figured (hopefully truly) is that the <code>ng-include</code> directive adds a comment node just above every item rendered by <code>ng-repeat</code> and this node is throwing off the <code>angular-animate</code>'s workings. This is also the only noticeable difference between the two implementations.</p>

<p>Please also note that all functionality works quite fine when no animations are set. But in the example using <code>ng-include</code>, not only are the animations (for moving items up or down) messed up, but the items don't even move.</p>

<p>Is this a bug? If so, is there a known workaround? I tried searching the angular.js's issues on github but couldn't find a workaround (The ones I found don't work). Thank you for any help on this.</p>

<p>I am using prepared statements, binding the results, and then using those bound results to populate dropdown. Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;option value=""""&gt;Select artist&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;?php   
    $artistQuery = ""SELECT ArtistID,ArtistName FROM Artist_v"";
    if($artist = mysqli_prepare($link,$artistQuery)){
        mysqli_stmt_execute($artist);
        $artistResult = mysqli_stmt_bind_result($artist,$artistID,$artistName);

        while(mysqli_stmt_fetch($artist)){
?&gt;
&lt;option value=""&lt;?php echo $artistID; ?&gt;""&gt;&lt;?php echo $artistName; ?&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;?php
        }
        mysqli_stmt_close($artist);
    }
?&gt;
&lt;option value=""Other""&gt;Add new...&lt;/option&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There is something you might notice is a little odd. Namely:</p>

<pre><code>$artistResult = mysqli_stmt_bind_result($artist,$artistID,$artistName);
</code></pre>

<p>In the <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli-stmt.bind-result.php"" rel=""nofollow"">PHP documentation for mysqli_stmt_bind_result</a> there is no reason whatsoever to capture this result into a variable, that something like this should be just fine:</p>

<pre><code>mysqli_stmt_bind_result($artist,$artistID,$artistName);
</code></pre>

<p>Not only that, the variable that I use to capture the result is never used. The only reason I capture at all is because without performing this capture <strong>processing always fails</strong>. Like ... the rest of the page refuses to even be produced. I've checked <code>mysqli_error()</code>, <code>error_reporting(E_ALL); ini_set('display_errors', '1');</code>, all the error messaging you can think of ... nothing.</p>

<p>What's worse, my development box doesn't have this issue, nor did my previous hosting provider ... I encountered this first when I changed to my new provider. This tells me (a) my original PHP is just fine, and (b) it could be a settings / options issue. I just have no idea where.</p>

<p>Has anyone experienced this? </p>

<p>By the way, don't ask me how I arrived at the variable capture thing to get it working ... it was a multi-hour trial-and-error session, and I couldn't tell you what my thinking was for trying it.</p>

<li><p>APNS (Apple push notification service) - whenever server has new data he will send a push notification to the client that there is new data waiting for him (the push does't carry the data itself), this will trigger a ""getData"" request from client to server.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This approach means that I need to send ""silent"" push (without showing alert to the user), and I'm not sure this is a good use of the APNS.</p>

<p>If I just run against one of the mongrel servers, the the app behaves ok, so I think its lightpd.</p>

<p>Its almost as if the lighttpd gets confused with multiple GET requests (i.e. multiple clicks) and bombs out.</p>

<pre><code>// parse the input stream using Jsoup

<p>In the case that there is more than one I'd like to collect them all. In the case that there are zero I'd prefer if the program didn't crash in a fireball of death and destruction. </p>

I've got a UITableViewController class that is instantiated from the Main App Delegate and it controls other views that get pushed into the UINavigationController instance created from the App Delegate. </p>

<p>On the UINavigationToolBar I have a UISegmentedControl button that is split in two pieces, Factory Loads and User Loads. I have an action method attached to the SegmentedControl to detect when the button is pressed and that method is inside the UIViewController Class. My goal is to have the view reload with the contents of a new dictionary that is constructed from a plist file in the app bundle. I have the dictionary loaded, and the keys to be displayed set up in the respective data formats, but when I try to reload the UITableView, it crashes. </p>

<p>This is the last code I tried to get to work inside my action method, but it still doesn't function as intended.</p>

<pre><code>- (void) action:(id)sender {

UISegmentedControl *segment = (UISegmentedControl *) sender;
if ([segment selectedSegmentIndex] == 1)
{
    NSLog(@""User Load Selected"");

    NSString *userLoadFilePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""UserLoads"" ofType:@""plist""];
    NSDictionary *userLoadDictionary = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:userLoadFilePath];
    NSArray *allKeys = [userLoadDictionary allKeys];
    keys = allKeys;
    dictionary = userLoadDictionary;

    [[self tableView] reloadData];
}

else if ([segment selectedSegmentIndex] == 0)
{
    NSLog(@""Factory Load Selected"");

    NSString *factoryLoadFilePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""AlliantPowder"" ofType:@""plist""];
    NSDictionary *factoryLoadDictionary = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:factoryLoadFilePath];
    NSArray *allKeys = [factoryLoadDictionary allKeys];
    keys = allKeys;

    [[self tableView] reloadData];
}
}

<p>I'm calling <code>[[self tableView] reloadData]</code> in an attempt to retrieve the actual table contained within the UIViewController to try to get the table to reload, but no luck. Any help is appreciated, and if more code is needed please ask. Thanks!</p>

<p>Andrew</p>

<p>------- Edit -----------
Here is the new code in reference to Chip's ideas. The issue is still not resolved and the app still crashes.</p>

<pre><code>- (void) action:(id)sender {

// Create an instance of UISegmentedControl and set it as the sending event.
UISegmentedControl *segment = (UISegmentedControl *) sender;

// Detect which button was pressed and load a new dictionary appropriately
// Checking if userLoads was selected
if ([segment selectedSegmentIndex] == 1)
{
    NSLog(@""User Load Selected"");

    keys = userKeys;
    [[self tableView] reloadData];
}

// Checking if factoryLoads was selected
else if ([segment selectedSegmentIndex] == 0)
{
    NSLog(@""Factory Load Selected"");

    keys = [dictionary allKeys];
    [[self tableView] reloadData];

}

[segment release];

            var button:Sprite = new Sprite();
            button.mouseEnabled = true;
            button.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, doResize);
            button.graphics.lineStyle(3,0x00ff00);
            button.graphics.beginFill(0x0000FF);
            button.graphics.drawRect(10, 10, 100, 100);
            button.graphics.endFill();

            this.addChild(button);
        }

        private function doResize(e:MouseEvent) : void {
            if (stage.displayState == StageDisplayState.NORMAL) {
                stage.displayState = StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN_INTERACTIVE;

<p>Further investigation shows that it seems like switching to fullscreen is two steps, first one resize to a <code>StageDisplayState.NORMAL</code> and then to <code>StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN_INTERACTIVE</code>.</p>

<pre><code>bool WaitMainThreadFinished(){WaitForSingleObject(m_hDoIt_Thread, INFINITE);...}
bool CheckMainThreadFinished(){WaitForSingleObject(m_hDoIt_Thread, 0);...}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I can Call KillThreads() fine. During this process, I WaitForSingleObject(m_hDoIt_Thread, INFINITE) so I know by the end of it, it's definitely signaled. Now if I try to call ResetThreads(), my WaitForSingleObject(m_hDoIt_Thread, 0) in CheckMainThreadFinished() gives me WAIT_FAILED whereas in my understanding it should be WAIT_OBJECT_0. What could possibly cause that?
What is interesting. Is that if I make two consecutive ResetThreads() calls, I don't get the said return value from CheckMainThreadFinished().</p>

<p>What I need to complete this is a list of country codes for all the countries in my 'Regions and Taxes' tab in JSON format that I can then use in my JavaScript file.</p>

<p>Just to (potentially) make it slightly trickier, we are going to have FIVE different shops each with different regions against each shop but all using the SAME set of templates uploaded from a single source control. So any code I write needs to be universal on all stores (i.e fetch the relevant JSON object to that shop). I can then either show people a country selector or not, depending if they are on the correct site</p>

<p>Is this possible Shopify / JavaScript gurus?</p>

<pre><code>public static ArrayList&lt;String[]&gt; dataArrayList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

    fileRead = new FileReader(txtFileLocation);
    dataReader = new BufferedReader(fileRead);

    //reading the text file
    for (int i = 0; line != null; i++) {
        line = dataReader.readLine();
        if (line != null) {

            //line has 13 Strings to split
            temp = line.split("","");

            //making a larger duplicate with 15 indices instead of 13 as to add 2 more Strings
            System.arraycopy(temp, 0, temp2, 0, temp.length);

            dataArrayList.add(temp2);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems like it should work, but when I access dataArrayList afterwards, either by printing it out or putting it into a JTable, all the records are copies of the last line of the .txt file.</p>

<p>For example, if the .txt file looked like this (apologies for unintended syntax highlighting):</p>

<pre><code>Hello,my,name,is,Hunter,how,are,you,doing,on,a,lovely,day,like,this
Have,you,heard,about,the,weather,we're,supposed,to,get,a,lot,of,rain,later
Hopefully,it's,sunny,for,the,entire,day,tomorrow,I,have,a,soccer,game,that,day
</code></pre>

<p>The first time it adds a record, dataArrayList looks as you expect it to, like this:</p>

<pre><code>Hello,my,name,is,Hunter,how,are,you,doing,on,a,lovely,day,like,this
</code></pre>

<p>However, after it runs over a second time and ""adds"" the second line, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Have,you,heard,about,the,weather,we're,supposed,to,get,a,lot,of,rain,later
Have,you,heard,about,the,weather,we're,supposed,to,get,a,lot,of,rain,later
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, after it adds the third record, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Hopefully,it's,sunny,for,the,entire,day,tomorrow,I,have,a,soccer,game,that,day
Hopefully,it's,sunny,for,the,entire,day,tomorrow,I,have,a,soccer,game,that,day
Hopefully,it's,sunny,for,the,entire,day,tomorrow,I,have,a,soccer,game,that,day
</code></pre>

<p>I don't understand what's happening... It seems like it's overwriting the previous records with the current one.</p>

<p>How can I add the height and width from this function (<code>onResize</code>) to the canvas or hidden input. I don't want it to use the 198x55 where it says that I want it to use the <code>onResize</code> height and width.</p>

<p>Here is the function:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
  (function(window) {
    var $canvas,
        onResize = function(event) {
          $canvas.attr({
            height: window.innerHeight,
            width: window.innerWidth
          });
        };

    $(document).ready(function() {
      $canvas = $('canvas');
      window.addEventListener('orientationchange', onResize, false);
      window.addEventListener('resize', onResize, false);
      onResize();

      $('form').signaturePad({
        drawBezierCurves: true,
        variableStrokeWidth:true,
        drawOnly: true,
        defaultAction: 'drawIt',
        validateFields: false,
        lineWidth: 0,
        output: null,
        sigNav: null,
        name: null,
        typed: null,
        clear: 'input[type=reset]',
        typeIt: null,
        drawIt: null,
        typeItDesc: null,
        drawItDesc: null
      });
    });
  }(this));
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>Basically I want it to know that the canvas is not 198x55 but it equals the same as the function <code>onResize</code> and I want it to save it for post through the hidden input</p>

<p>and then when it sends to the next page I also need this to equal it aswell..</p>

Everything installs correctly and I can access the server, but it requires that I enable secure_admin to access the server remotely from my host machine.</p>

<p>The problem lies in that I cannot seem to find, or understand the JSON syntax for Vagrant to properly modify the attribute for secure_admin to enable.</p>

<p>I am using this cookbook: <a href=""https://github.com/realityforge/chef-glassfish"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/realityforge/chef-glassfish</a></p>

<p>In the instructions it explains to modify such attributes to enter code such as this:</p>

<pre><code># Create a basic domain that logs to a central graylog server
glassfish_domain ""my_domain"" do
  port 80
  admin_port 8103
  extra_libraries ['https://github.com/downloads/realityforge/gelf4j/gelf4j-0.9-all.jar']
  logging_properties {
    ""handlers"" =&gt; ""java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler, gelf4j.logging.GelfHandler"",
    "".level"" =&gt; ""INFO"",
    ""java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level"" =&gt; ""INFO"",
    ""gelf4j.logging.GelfHandler.level"" =&gt; ""ALL"",
    ""gelf4j.logging.GelfHandler.host"" =&gt; 'graylog.example.org',
    ""gelf4j.logging.GelfHandler.defaultFields"" =&gt; '{""environment"": ""' + node.chef_environment + '"", ""facility"": ""MyDomain""}'
  }
end
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I wish to modify features such as the port or domain name, I have to edit those attributes with this syntax (Whats in my vagrantfile already):</p>

<pre><code>chef.json = {


    ""glassfish"" =&gt; {
         ""base_dir"" =&gt; ""/usr/local/glassfish"",
         ""domains_dir"" =&gt; ""/usr/local/glassfish/glassfish/domains"",
         ""domains"" =&gt; {
            ""domain1"" =&gt; {
               ""config"" =&gt; {
             ""domain_name"" =&gt; ""domain1"",
             ""admin_port"" =&gt; 4848,
             ""username"" =&gt; ""root"",
             ""password"" =&gt; ""admin"",
                }
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>This code makes sense to me as I see within the recipe ""attribute_driven_domain"" in this cookbook, that the open statements are described as such. Meaning to edit the minimum memory of the domain, I would have type:</p>

<pre><code>""glassfish"" =&gt; {
   ""domains"" =&gt; {
      ""domain1"" =&gt; {
         ""config"" =&gt; {
            ""min_memory"" =&gt; 512
         }
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which this ^ , corresponds to:</p>

<pre><code>['glassfish']
['domains']
['config']
['min_memory']
</code></pre>

<p>....Found in this section of the recipe:</p>

<pre><code>gf_sort(node['glassfish']['domains']).each_pair do |domain_key, definition|
  domain_key = domain_key.to_s

  Chef::Log.info ""Defining GlassFish Domain #{domain_key}""

  admin_port = definition['config']['admin_port']
  username = definition['config']['username']
  secure = definition['config']['secure']
  password_file = username ? ""#{node['glassfish']['domains_dir']}/#{domain_key}_admin_passwd"" : nil
  system_username = definition['config']['system_user']
  system_group = definition['config']['system_group']

  if (definition['config']['port'] &amp;&amp; definition['config']['port'] &lt; 1024) || (admin_port &amp;&amp; admin_port &lt; 1024)
    include_recipe 'authbind'
  end

glassfish_domain domain_key do
    min_memory definition['config']['min_memory'] if definition['config']['min_memory']
    max_memory definition['config']['max_memory'] if definition['config']['max_memory']
    max_perm_size definition['config']['max_perm_size'] if definition['config']['max_perm_size']
    max_stack_size definition['config']['max_stack_size'] if definition['config']['max_stack_size']
    port definition['config']['port'] if definition['config']['port']
</code></pre>

<p>However, at the part that defines the secure admin, I can't see a distinct place that would indicate where it is supposed to be placed in the chef.json block. Found in this section:</p>

<pre><code>glassfish_secure_admin ""#{domain_key}: secure_admin"" do
    domain_name domain_key
    admin_port admin_port if admin_port
    username username if username
    password_file password_file if password_file
    secure secure if secure
    system_user system_username if system_username
    system_group system_group if system_group
    action ('true' == definition['config']['remote_access'].to_s) ? :enable : :disable
  end
</code></pre>

<p>I can't seem to figure out where the secure_admin attribute is suppose to placed in the chef.json block within my vagrantfile. I've tried placing it different spots, such as under the glassfish level, under the domains level, under the config.</p>

<p>I really don't know what I am exactly suppose to put, or where.</p>

<p>I have been using variants of this:</p>

<pre><code>""secure_admin"" =&gt; {
  ""domain_name"" =&gt; ""domain1""
  ""action"" =&gt; :enable
}
</code></pre>

<p>or like this if it was under domain1 but above config:</p>

<pre><code>""secure_admin"" =&gt; {
  ""action"" =&gt; :enable
}
</code></pre>

<p>Most of the time it doesn't give any feedback of change or error, sometimes if its put in certain spots it fails because it tries to read it as a separate domain, but other than that not much.</p>

<p>Is the syntax that I'm currently using to modify attributes incorrect? I'm pretty fresh with this stuff, so I don't really know. Sorry for the terribly long post.</p>

<p>but I can't find a sort algorithm that gives both. As suggested <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2828059/sorting-arrays-in-numpy-by-column"">here</a>, I've tried <code>A[A[:,0].argsort()]</code> and <code>A[A[:,1].argsort()]</code>, but they only sort one column each. I've also tried applying both but the same thing happens.</p>

<p>I apologize if I've missed something simple but I've been looking for this for a while now...</p>

<p>When using the FB Social Plugins I have seen several articles outlining the following code (this is just a general example as the fb:like attributes can vary of course):</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""fb-root""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
      window.fbAsyncInit = function() {
        FB.init({
            appId: '#############', //configure FB App ID
            status: true, 
            cookie: true,
            xfbml: true
        });
      };
      (function() {
        var e = document.createElement('script');
        e.type = 'text/javascript';
        e.src = document.location.protocol + '//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js';
        e.async = true;
        document.getElementById('fb-root').appendChild(e);
      }());
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src=""http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;fb:like href=""www.domain.com"" show_faces=""false"" width=""450"" font=""arial""&gt;&lt;/fb:like&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I am wondering the following:</p>

<p>1)  When using most of the social plugins (Ex: Like, Activity, Recommendations, etc) is there a need to include both the full SDK script and the second script tag?</p>

<p>In other words could one just include the following on their site:</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;fb:like href=""www.domain.com"" show_faces=""false"" width=""450"" font=""arial""&gt;&lt;/fb:like&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>2) Are there any advantages of including both?</p>

<p>3) If you do not include the full script is there any reason to register for an App ID?</p>

<p>Thanks for any clarification that you may be able to provide!</p>

<p>So, I'm using pandas/python for some ETL work. Row-wise calculations are performed so I need them as numeric types within the process (left this part out). I need to output some of the fields as an array and get rid of the single quotes, nan's, and "".0""'s.</p>

<p>First question, is there a way to vectorize these if else statements ala <code>ifelse</code> in <code>R</code>? Second, surely there is a better way to remove the "".0"". There seems to be major issues with out pandas/numpy handles nulls in numeric types.</p>

<p>Finally, the <code>.replace</code> does not seem to work on the DataFrame for single quotes. Am I missing something? Here's the sample code, please let me know if you have any questions about it:</p>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd

# have some nulls and need it in integers
d = {'one' : [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0],'two' : [4.0, 3.0, NaN, 1.0]}
dat = pd.DataFrame(d)

# make functions to get rid of the "".0"" and necessarily converting to strings
def removeforval(val):
    if str(val)[-2:] == "".0"":
        val = str(val)[:len(str(val))-2]
    else:
        val = str(val)
    return val
def removeforcol(col):
    col = col.apply(removeforval)
    return col
dat = dat.apply(removeforcol,axis=0)
# remove the nan's
dat = dat.replace('nan','')

# need some fields in arrays on a postgres database
quoted  = ['{' + str(tuple(x))[1:-1] + '}'  for x in dat.to_records(index=False)]
print ""Before single quote removal""
print quoted

# try to replace single quotes using DataFrame's replace
quoted_df = pd.DataFrame(quoted).replace('\'','')
quoted_df = quoted_df.replace('\'','')
print ""DataFrame does not seem to work""
print quoted_df

# use a loop
for item in range(len(quoted)):
    quoted[item] = quoted[item].replace('\'','')
print ""This Works""
print quoted

<p>I'll try to give you an (easier) example of what I have to do and what I have in mind to achieve it (but without a clue how to do it in MATLAB ):</p>

<pre><code>syms x1 x2 x3 x4 real
X = [x1 x2 x3 x4]'
F = [1 2 3 4; 1 2 3 4]
Y = [9 8]'
my_fun = (F*X + Y)' * (F*X + Y)
%solve my_fun to min for X
</code></pre>

<p>So, this is what I want to have <code>(my_fun)</code>.</p>

<p>The thing is, that there will be <code>x1</code> to <code>x192</code>, <strong><code>F</code></strong> will be like 10000x192 and <strong><code>Y</code></strong> like 10000x1. Using symbolic tb is very slow and since I later have to calculate the Hessian it is superdupser slow.</p>

<p>I now found a way to numerically calculate the Hessian (from MATLAB file exchange) but have no clue, how to calculate <code>my_fun</code> as an (anonymous) function. I simply lack the skills of MATLAB + function handles. I already tried several things.</p>

<p>So, I think what I need to know is how to create <strong><code>X</code></strong> dynamically with <code>x(1)</code> to <code>x(192)</code> and then calculate <code>my_fun = @(x) ...</code></p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks for the edit :)
The only thing that I can think of to solve this is by using a couple of loops to create the anonymous function handle as a string and then use <code>str2fun</code>, but I feel like this isn't the easiest way to get what I need :)</p>

This works great when the window is maximised, but when it's not, the WM_NCLBUTTONUP message never arrives! I do get a WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN message though. Strangely WM_NCLBUTTONUP does arrive if I click on the right of the menu bar, but anywhere along the caption bar / window frame, the message never arrives.</p>

<p>After a while of debugging I discovered that if I set a breakpoint on CMainFrame::OnNcLButtonDown(), clicked the caption bar, but keep the mouse button held down, let the debugger break in the function, hit F5 to continue debugging, then release the mouse button - magically WM_NCLBUTTONUP is sent!!</p>

<p>My question is two-fold, (1) what the hell is going on? (2) how do I get around this ""problem"".</p>

<p>I also note that there are several other people on the internet who have the same issue (a quick Google reveals lots of other people with the same issue, but no solution).</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong><br />
Thanks for the first two replies, I've tried calling ReleaseCapture in NCLButtonDown, but it has no effect (in fact, it returns NULL, indicating a capture is not in place). I can only assume that the base class (def window proc) functionality may set a capture. I shall investigate on Monday...</p>

<p>I am working on a 3d game, where I need to transfer my mouse-input to a certain height in the 3d world, so I can move a unit across a surface. </p>

<p>This is done from the perspective of a tilted camera (45 degress tilted). the playcanvas API supplies me with a function on my camera, which can translate my mouse input on the 2d screen, into the 3d world using a set depth. </p>

<p>when I set my depth to 0, I get the exact coordinates of my camera (which in this case is (0,80,80), and if I set the depth to 100, I get ~(0.09, 11.52, 7.06)... </p>

<p>I need a way to figure out either the coordinates where the line between the two points hits the height (y-axis of 2), OR I could find a way to calculate the depth I need to supply the camera in order to get back the coordinates I need</p>

<p><strong>which leads me to:</strong></p>

<p>It seems that the only way to hijack the Home Button is to be registered as the default launcher, so that your own app gets the focus when home is pressed. This is easily achieved in the manifest, such as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity android:excludeFromRecents=""false""&gt;
 &lt;intent-filter&gt;
  &lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.DEFAULT""/&gt;
  &lt;action android:name=""android.intent.action.MAIN""/&gt; 
  &lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.LAUNCHER""/&gt;
  &lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.HOME""/&gt;
 &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
&lt;/activity&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now the problem is: If I do quit the application, the original launcher should be made available to the user and I think the solution would be to just start the original launcher, but how should I do that? The original Android-way of ""intents"" is not available in AIR and the navigatetoURL() function seems to work only for special URIs, e.g. ""market://.."" launches the default market app, however, I need to execute an arbitrary application...</p>

<p>Edit: I am referring to a mobile Android App running in this case on an Archos tablet, but it could run on any Android device with AIR installed, such as a typical mobile phone like the HTC desire. With ""home button"" I am referring to the respective hardware button that allows the user to switch applications (or, to be more exact, to switch to a launcher app that typically shows all the apps as icons to tap on). This ""home button"" functionality I need to block, as the user should not be able to easily switch to another application.</p>

Given that as of version 3.0.1 the store credits functionality has not been implemented I'm trying to implement a simple system myself.</p>

<p>I ran a migration to add a column to <strong>Spree::User</strong> indicating the amount of store credit they have. Also added was a new step on the checkout process where a user can choose to use some or all of the store credit that is available. This step generates a price adjustment reducing the price of the order. A field was also created on <strong>Spree::Order</strong> to store how much of the store credit is being used on the transaction.</p>

<p>So far this has been done without much trouble. The real trouble comes when I'm trying to update the credit that the user has left. I have this code in my order_decorator.rb</p>

<pre><code>Spree::Order.state_machine.after_transition to: :complete, do: :update_user_credit

def update_user_credit
  credit_used = self.credit_used
  initial_credit = self.user.credit
  self.user.update(credit: initial_credit - credit_used)
end

<p>Updating the user credit from the console has been done. The user is accessible from the callbacks, since I have used the credit for some validations.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 15/06/2014 22:41</strong></p>

<p>Ok,</p>

<p>sorry everybody I understood the source of the problem.</p>

<p>What I was checking was</p>

<pre><code>(preg_match(""/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/"", $username))
</code></pre>

<p>In my code, $username got this treatment</p>

<pre><code>    $username = clean_data($_POST[""username""]);
    if (!preg_match(""/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/"", $username)) {
        $usernameERR = ""Only letters and numbers allowed"";
      }
</code></pre>

<p>where</p>

<pre><code>    function clean_data($data) {
    $data = trim($data);
    $data = stripslashes($data);
    $data = htmlspecialchars($data);
    return $data;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>so when i post 
\q\q\q\q\q\q\q\q\q
this is stripped and become 
qqqqqqqqq</p>

<p>BUT, there are two problems. First problems was that I was echoing this</p>

<pre><code>echo ""post username: "" . $_POST[""username""];
</code></pre>

<p>and comparing with this</p>

<pre><code>echo ""preg username "" . preg_match(""/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/"", $username);
</code></pre>

<p>and it's clear that $_POST[""username""] is not == to $username because this last one got the treatment of the clead_data function, while the POST not.</p>

<p>So when I was doing the preg_match, I was doing on $username = qqqqqqqqqqq (which is alphanumeric) while what i showed you was $_POST['username'] = \q\q\q\q\q\q\q\q\q\q\q</p>

<p>The second problem was that i was sending to the database this</p>

<pre><code>$username = mysqli_real_escape_string($con, $_POST['username']);
</code></pre>

<p>while I should have sent this</p>

<pre><code>$username = mysqli_real_escape_string($con, $username);
</code></pre>

<p>So on the database was arriving the NON CLEANED data.</p>

<p>I have two tables, relatively simple. 
The first Employee has an id column and a name column
The second table Dependencies has 3 column, an id, an eid (employee id to link) and names (apple, orange etc). </p>

<p>the data looks like this
Employee table looks like this</p>

<pre><code>id  | name
-----------
1   | Pat
2   | Tom
3   | Rob
4   | Sam
</code></pre>

<p>Dependencies </p>

<pre><code>id  | eid | Name
--------------------
1   | 1   |  Orange
2   | 1   |  Apple
3   | 2   |  Strawberry
4   | 2   |  Apple
5   | 3   |  Orange
6   | 3   |  Banana
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see Pat has both Orange and Apple and he needs to be excluded and it has to be via joins and i can't seem to get it to work. Ultimately the data should only return Rob</p>

<p><code>NioClientSocketChannelFactory.NioClientSocketChannelFactory(Executor bossExecutor, Executor workerExecutor, int workerCount)</code></p>

<p>I have a single ClientBootstrap and Channel and am writing multiple requests to different hosts, and am not setting and bootstrap options. As an example I may be pushing through 100 requests using an iterator.</p>

<p>How should I configure this?
I've tried different combinations of Single and Cached Pool Executors with either 1 or 100 max workers.  Here are some examples:</p>

<ol>
<li>When using a single executor and 1 worker it seems to provide multithreaded requests but when setting the count to 100 it appears single threaded</li>
<li>When using the Cached Pool Executor, setting the count to 1 also seems more efficient. Increasing the worker count seems to make it slower.</li>
</ol>

<p>So... how should I configure the factory for best performance based on wanting hundreds or more concurrent requests?</p>

<p>I got the code for the collision detection from this page: <a href=""http://as3gametuts.com/2012/01/08/platformer-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://as3gametuts.com/2012/01/08/platformer-3/</a>. There are still lots of bugs in the code though: for example, if you move left while there is a solid object left of you but it is lower than the left bump point, you pass right through it. Also, if you are moving with high speed, you can move through objects. Does anyone know a proper tutorial, or even better: can anyone give me some tips to start off with? </p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

What might be the cause of all the objects's values being set to null?

<p>I have a device whose address is <code>192.168.4.83</code>. This device is connected directly to my pc linux server, which has address <code>192.168.4.11</code>.</p>

<p>I want to send a UDP packet from a server to the device, using python. The server is also listening for responses. I have a simple python script to do that. I send using:</p>

<pre><code>    self.sendSocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    self.sendSocket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST,1)
    sock.sendSocket.send(msg,('&lt;boradcast&gt;', UDP_PORT))
</code></pre>

<p>I listen and bind to 0.0.0.0. The code is very simple: one thread is sending udp packets, the other one has while(1) loop which only receives packets.</p>

<p>This is the listening code:</p>

<pre><code>class CUdp(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, log=False):
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
        self.running = True
        self.listenSocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
        self.listenSocket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
        self.listenSocket.bind(("""", UDP_PORT))
        self.last_time = 0
        self.now = 0
        self.log = log
    def run(self):
        global sent_time
        while(self.running):
            data, addr = self.listenSocket.recvfrom(1024) 
            if data != None:
               recv_time = time.time()
               myprint(""[RECV "" +  str(datetime.datetime.now()) + ""] (len="" + str(len(data)) +"") : "" +  str(data)+""\n"", self.log)
</code></pre>

<p>The strange thing is that, on wireshark i can see that: packet has been sent from <code>192.168.4.11</code> to <code>255.255.255.255</code>, and device has responded to this packet - packet from <code>192.168.4.83</code> has been sent to <code>255.255.255.255</code>. It seems, that using bind (0.0.0.0, port) does not cover <code>255.255.255.255</code>. I'm lost and I have no ideas.</p>

While I managed to capture the scroll positions; the DataGridView tends to reset itself in the display showing row 1 through last visible column - yet my scroll bars maintain position. Also I would like my DataGridView to allow for more user interactivity , but it is clunky at best.

<p>Basically, what I want to do is use IIS urlrewrite module to do a redirect to a specific URL if the user accesses a URL on another site.  The only catch is I have to also capture a bit of the query string, and move it into the redirect.  I think I actually DO have the regex correct for this, but it's implementing it in my web.config that is causing the problem.</p>

<p>so here is the input, the URL that a user may access would look like:</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://of.example.com/sfsv3.aspx?waform=pro&amp;language=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://of.example.com/sfsv3.aspx?waform=pro&amp;language=en</a></strong></p>

<p>I want to match that URL (either http or https, case insensitive), and capture from it also one piece of information, the two letter language code.  then the url i want to forward the user to looks like:</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://example.com/ca/en/ppf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/ca/en/ppf</a></strong></p>

<p>(where en is replaced by whatever i captured above)</p>

<p>So, I'm working with IIS Rewrite module, and I've gotten my input data and regex in, so far the regex pattern I have is this:</p>

<pre><code>https?://of.example.com/sfsv3.aspx\?waform=pro&amp;(language=(..))
</code></pre>

<p>so basically i'm matching the whole string, plus a group and a subgroup for language and it's code.  in the IIS test pattern dialog, this is working.</p>

<p>I get the following</p>

<p>{R:1} language=en</p>

<p>{R:2} en</p>

<p>great!  so then my IIS rewrite rule should look like this to redirect the user:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;system.webServer&gt;
    &lt;rewrite&gt;
      &lt;rules&gt;
        &lt;rule name=""test"" stopProcessing=""true"" enabled=""true""&gt;
          &lt;match url=""https?://of.example.com/sfsv3.aspx\?waform=pro&amp;(language=(..))"" ignoreCase=""true"" /&gt;
          &lt;action type=""Redirect"" url=""http://www.example.com/ca/{R:2}/ppf"" /&gt;
        &lt;/rule&gt;
      &lt;/rules&gt;
    &lt;/rewrite&gt;
  &lt;/system.webServer&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>this all seems right to me.  however, IIS is balking and saying that my web.config is invalid.  specifically, it says ""Entity '(' is not defined"" and it's pointing to the ( right before language as the problem.  So, I can't build or deploy this application till I fix that.  If i build it without and then just try to drop that into the web.config, i get an error loading the site: </p>

<p>HTTP Error 500.19 - Internal Server Error
The requested page cannot be accessed because the related configuration data for the page is invalid.</p>

<p>Can someone help me figure out how to put a capture group into a rewrite rule properly?</p>

<p>For a ""normal"" x86 architecture:</p>

<p>When I call a large function in C++, is the memory then allocated immediately for all stack variables?
Or are there compilers which can (and do) modify the stack size even if the function is not finished.</p>

<p>For example if a new scope starts:</p>

<pre><code>int largeFunction(){
    int a = 1;
    int b = 2;

    // .... long code ....

    { // new scope

         int c = 5;

         // .... code again ....

    }

    // .....
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Could the call stack ""grow"" also for the variable c at the beginning of the separate scope and ""shrink"" at its end? 
Or will current compilers always produce code which affects the stack pointer at the entry and return value of the function?
Thanks for your answer in advance.</p>

<p>I'm thinking I should start to use some inheritance as they have a lot of copied methods.</p>

<p>The Instance() methods for each Manager is the same.</p>

<p>So for inheritance  i can do this (obviously):</p>

<pre><code>GroupManager extends Manager

<p>Is it possible to use generics to use the same Instance method for all managers, something like:</p>

<pre><code>public class Manager&lt;E&gt;
{
    private static E instance = null;

    public static E Instance()

<p>Setting aside for the moment whether this will always produce satisfactory results for users when an ideal version of Charter is present (so far it does for me), is there a way to ensure that this will have the same effect on machines that I can't test it on. Clearly this fails gracefully for users that lack Charter entirely, but what I wonder is whether the there are Charters in wide use that lack the features that make my version work. </p>

<p>Are there versions of Charter that are better or worse for rendering MathJax? If so how can a locate and test them, or perhaps exclude versions that are less capable?</p>

<hr>

<p>Note this is not a question about downloading Charter along with the pages. If a user doesn't have Charter, he probably isn't attached to it and will be fine with MathJax's default font. What I want to be sure of is that a user who has Charter gets MathJax as Charter, but that users with ""poor"" Charters (if they exist) aren't punished.</p>

<p>It shows 'processing result' as many times as I have results. If allResults.size() is 25, it shows processing result 1, processing result 2 ... processing result 24.</p>

<p>Here's the extra code that's missing:</p>

private int resultsIndex = 0;

private synchronized int getResultsIndex() {

<p>I inspired myself from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/24359746"">this answer</a> by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/785541/wladimir-palant"">Wladimir Palant</a> and I used <a href=""http://pastebin.com/P0ttkDmw"" rel=""nofollow"">this css file</a> he shared in a comment in order to have an ""offline"" version of the fontawesome styles, but it looks like I'm still missing a little something because I cannot see the little icons.</p>

<p>Actually, the only thing that is displayed in the buttons are the carrets (the ""down arrows"") and the icons for bold, italic etc are simply not present.</p>

<p>Here are my files:</p>

<pre><code>// lib/main.js
var data = require('sdk/self').data;
var pageMod = require('sdk/page-mod');

pageMod.PageMod({
  include: ""http://localhost/testpage.html"",
  contentStyleFile: [
    data.url('P0ttkDmw.css'),
    data.url('bootstrap.min.css'),
    data.url('summernote/dist/summernote.css')
  ],
  contentScriptFile: [
    data.url('jquery-1.11.2.min.js'),
    data.url('bootstrap.min.js'),
    data.url('summernote/dist/summernote.min.js'),
    data.url('summernote-main.js')
  ]
});
</code></pre>

<p>Here how I called the editor (does not seem to be really related to the problem though):</p>

<pre><code>// summernote-main.js
$(function() {
  $('textarea.ToReplace').summernote();
});

<p>So what would be the best way to cross between the different ViewModels? I'll be adding more pages. So is there a way to make like a universal property that all ViewModels can access?</p>

For example:</p>

<pre><code>@using (Html.BeginForm(""DoRegister"", ""Account"")) {
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't like either <code>DoRegister</code> or <code>Account</code>, because it's looking for a class <code>AccountController</code> with an action <code>DoRegister</code>. What we've actually got is a folder <code>Controllers\Account</code>, with a single-action class <code>DoRegister</code>.</p>

<p>Can I teach ReSharper about this? If not, can I get it to ignore this particular pattern?</p>

<p>I know that I can right-click and Ignore Errors in the Errors in Solution window, but this only lasts until I pull an updated version of the code from source control, which gets annoying quite quickly.</p>

<p>An example here - let's say I have a database table which has 3 models (the main model, the mapper model and the database model). Each of those extend an abstract model,mapper and db table model.</p>

<p>This setup works very nicely. The bulk of operations are actually in the abstract models. But, now I am wanting to abstract even more. Am I going to far?</p>

<p>I have already abstracted basic CRUD operations, now I am thinking about abstracting the more advanced ones.</p>

<p>An example of that would be fetching a few related models. Currently I would do this:</p>

<p>$modelOne->modelTwo(); where modelTwo is explicitly defined. </p>

<p>My idea was to then use either an abstract method like injectModel('modelTwo') or a magic method.</p>

<p>I can always build in the relevant rules to ensure my models maintain integrity...but is this too far?</p>

<p>Appreciate any advice.</p>

<p>I don't care how incoherent some of my code is; I can write clear documentation and comments in those parts.</p>

<p>From the Particle class of my program:</p>

<pre><code>    public void calculateAttractions(List&lt;Particle&gt; entities)
    {
        foreach (Particle p in entities)
        {
            if (!p.Equals(this))
            {
                Vector2 dx = this.Position - p.Position;
                this.ApplyForce(-dx / dx.LengthSquared());
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The brute-force method can only simulate ~150 particles in my program (using the XNA framework and Farseer physics engine) before running into performance issues.</p>

<p>If there is no other way, how might this code be optimized, or else how might I cheat? I've tried randomizing the call to calculateAttractions() on a particle-to-particle basis, such that at any given time only around 1/3 of the particles are actually being updated. This resulted in some improvement in performance, but at the cost of accuracy, of course.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is similar to gravitational force calculations. Someone in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7115439/optimizing-gravitation-calculation-for-particles-in-a-zero-gravity-2d-space"">this thread</a> suggested working with complex numbers and using the equation: </p>

<pre><code>(z-z')/abs(z-z')**3
</code></pre>

<p>However, I don't know what z refers to and I cant find reference to this equation anywhere else.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Though I've accepted an answer below, I ended up using a solution that nobody mentioned: a look-up table. Basically, I pre-calculate the force exerted on one particle by another particle at all distances (with a resolution of 1 pixel) up to 2000 pixels away in any direction. Forces can then be determined without any runtime distance calculations. Though it's not an exact solution, the distortion is not perceivable and it has allowed me to increase the number of simulation particles three-fold (to the point where the number is now limited by the physics engine and not by the n-body problem.)</strong></p>

(While allowing to manually modify the access rights for single items in the directory tree.)</p>

<p>I tried to do it with the <code>&lt;Directory(Match)&gt;</code> directives. The server configuration (000-sites-enabled) looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>DocumentRoot /var/www
&lt;Directory /var/www&gt;
    Allow from all
    Deny from none
    Order deny,allow
&lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;Directory /var/www/*&gt;
    Deny from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A query to <code>http://localhost/</code> successfully displays <code>/var/www/index.html</code> and all queries to any subdirectories fail.</p>

<p>The problem is: any query to a file in the httproot fails - i.e. requesting <code>http://localhost/index.html</code> will result into <code>403 Forbidden</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;Directory(Match)&gt;</code> directives seem to actually match directories AND files!?</p>

<p>To see if this is true, i tried:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Directory /var/www/i*&gt;
    Deny from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This denies access only to files/directories starting with 'i'.</p>

<p>Is there a way to alter this behaviour and let <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> match only directories? Is there another way to accomplish that all the subdirectories are denied? (besides denying all of them manually or enabling all files manually)</p>

<p>I have a boolean value to set, to know which mode is the user currently in, to perform CRUD operations in the specific database table.

<p>But generates the following error: </p>

<p><em><strong>Fatal error: Can not use object of type user as array in ... on line 112</em></strong> </p>

<p>How can I fix? </p>

<p>Otherwise it I thought I would sort the array at the time of Celect database. 
This is my query:</p>

<pre><code>    $stmt = $db-&gt;prepare(""SELECT * ""
                    . ""FROM `users` ""
                    . ""INNER JOIN `friend` ON (`username` = `user_req`) ""
                    . ""WHERE (`user_acc` = ? AND `status` = '1') ""
                    . ""UNION DISTINCT ""
                    . ""SELECT * ""
                    . ""FROM `users` ""

                    . ""WHERE (`user_req` = ? AND `status` = '1')"");  
</code></pre>

<p>If I add an ORDER BY clause, in this way, the query no longer works</p>

<pre><code>    $stmt = $db-&gt;prepare(""(SELECT * ""
                    . ""FROM `users` ""

                    . ""WHERE (`user_req` = ? AND `status` = '1')) ORDER BY `username`""); 
</code></pre>

<p>No matter how the array is sorted (at sql or php), it is important that it is sorted by username. </p>

<p>How can I do? Thanks</p>

Second, I dont know where in my phone it goes and I want to see it to help trouble shoot, so if you know how to do that too, it would be great.  So now I will give you an overview of what is happening. When I start my program it checks to see if the file exists, if it doesn't it reads a file out of my assets folder and copies that info and sends it to a file into the sd card. If it exits it reads the info from the sd card. Next if I press a button and change numbers and print it to my sd card again then I close it using task managers then when I come back the original information is here. I don't feel like it is being able to find  my sd card location. So far I have used.</p>

<pre><code>File outfilepath = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory();
String FileName = ""ExSettings.txt"" ;
File outfile = new File(outfilepath.getAbsolutePath()+""/TimeLeft/""+FileName);

Workstation is Widows 7, using Sublime Text3, Rails 4.1.7</p>

<p>I aimed to build my first API, and found Matthew Sullivan's blog post at <a href=""https://codelation.com/blog/rails-restful-api-just-add-water"" rel=""nofollow"">https://codelation.com/blog/rails-restful-api-just-add-water</a>. More specifically I followed Beryllium's post at <a href=""http://blog.berylliumwork.com/2014/09/rails-and-angular-data.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.berylliumwork.com/2014/09/rails-and-angular-data.html</a> which is verbatim Matt's post with the exception of an added option to the routes setting a default parameter for the format, and different model names.</p>

<p>I followed both posts to the letter, and the api calls worked correctly, json output shows in the browser.</p>

<p>I then applied the same modules to one of my on-going projects. Calling the API produced the error message </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>undefined local variable or method `json' line#1 of the index.json.jbuilder file</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried to trace down the cause of the error and did the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>looked through all lines of code in the modules/controllers, and view .json.jbuilder files, corrected any mistakes, <strong>error message persists</strong> </li>
<li>called the index.json.jbuilder and show.json.jbuilder that is created by scaffold, <strong>no error message</strong>, then called the api's separate index.json.jbuilder and show.json.jbuilder <strong>error message returns</strong> (<em>the problem must be the api's json.jbuilder files or something still in the modules</em>)</li>
<li>after more tinkering, searching stackoverflow for an answer and creating a few more new projects to test (all which did NOT display error message), I ""saved as.."" every api file in my project as UTF-8 just to be sure. <strong>error message persists</strong></li>
<li>I had created the api's json files using the 'new file' from Sublime Text3, then 'saved as..' into my project (UTF-8). So, I decided to delete the api's index.json.jbuilder and show.json.jbuilder files, and replace them using 'rails generator jbuilder' <strong>no more error message</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why would this error message occur and this fix rectify it? I assumed it was a problem with rails, my code, but now it seems the actual files, or maybe even my own box.</p>

<pre><code>java.io.FileNotFoundException: res/drawable-mdpi/background.png

 android.content.res.Resources$NotFoundException: File res/drawable-mdpi/background.png from drawable resource ID #0x7f02001f
</code></pre>

<p>This is by all means untrue because otherwise I wouldn;t have compiled or run the program myself. Also I am sure the resources are there. This is just one of the exception I have been reported. There are same exceptions for other resources mainly layouts.</p>

<p>So my question is how would this happen? Is it because the android system has failed installing correctly my app? I almost sure this must be the case because I have many users who use it without problem. </p>

<p>Please help regarding this.</p>

<p>For testing I added a simple Polygon (polygon2) and it gets drawn. I am parsing the coordinates from a JSON File. I logged the corrds and they seem to be alright. One thing I noticed is that die JSONArray coordinates contains null references.</p>

<p>Can anybody give me a clue ?</p>

<p>After applying a CamanJS filter I'm trying to do sth with canvas (eg. drag and move layer or just click on it), but then the canvas reverts to its original state (before applying CamanJS filter). So the question is: how to ""tell"" KineticJS to update cache(?) or do sth like stage.draw() to keep new canvas data?</p>

<p>Here is <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/8JD8N/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">jsfiddle</a> (click on ""apply filter"", when processing will be done, try to drag the star).</p>

<p>BTW: why is the processing so slow?</p>

<p>A basic schema could look like:</p>

<pre><code>Things
  - ID
  - ThingName
  - CreatedOn
  - CreatedBy
  - CreatedIn
  - LastModifiedOn
  - LastModifiedBy
  - LastModifiedIn
  - HiddenOn (nullable)
  - HiddenBy (nullable)
  - HiddenIn (nullable)
</code></pre>

<p>This bugs me a bit. Coming from OOP, and given that this data will be primarily consumed by linq-to-sql, it feels like I could extract the repeated fields into a separate structure, which would also act as a schema contract of sorts:</p>

<pre><code>Actions
  - ID
  - ExecutedOn
  - ExecutedBy
  - ExecutedIn

Things
  - ID
  - ThingName
  - CreatedAction -&gt; Actions.ID
  - LastModifiedAction -&gt; Actions.ID
  - HiddenAction (nullable) -&gt; Actions.ID
</code></pre>

<p>I could then reuse the Actions table for storing the same auditing information for other Things I might have in the database. There would be a lot of foreign keys pointing to this table.</p>

<p>I'm concerned on whether aggregating data related to many parts of the database could cause problems in the long run. I'm wondering,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Would this become a source of insert contention (Working with SQL Server 2008)?</p></li>
<li><p>Would searching by those fields become more expensive because there will be a lot more rows, and could I mitigate that by indexing it on a discriminator?</p></li>
<li><p>Generally, good idea or bad?</p></li>

<p>In the Console from Chrome Developer tools I get the following message:</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ( ... my_file.php(line 1799)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CACHE_MISS 
</code></pre>

<p>However, I cannot inspect the page's source. It simply shows in blank, or is not loaded.</p>

<p>I looked into the Resource tab, into the script file and searched for the affected line. Line 1799 has a commented instruction:</p>

<pre><code>//location.reload();
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't make sense and this is not the first time that I had a report in Chrome only to find out that the problem was in another line or file.</p>

<p>In Firebug nothing is reported, despite the fact that the javascript also does not work.</p>

<p><strong>What steps could I try to figure out what is this error coming from?</strong></p>

<p>I already tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refreshing the page. It's common knowledge that the script only loads after I load the page a second time;</li>
<li>Inspecting the file's script in the Source Tab - it shows in blank (regardless of how many times I refresh);</li>
<li>Inspecting the file's script in the Resources Tab - the error shows in a commented line. The line 1799 shows a commented instruction;</li>
<li>Inspecting the file's script in Firebug shows nothing. No errors are thrown in the Script or in the Console. And yet, the javascript does not work...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I fixed the ERR_CACHE_MISS by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> (load and delete cache), as suggested <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26408931/bizarre-error-in-chrome-developer-console-failed-to-load-resource-neterr-ca"">in this thread</a>.</p>

<p>However, the syntax error (unexpected closing brackets) is still showing up. The location of the faulty line varies with each page refresh, but they show on lines that look fine.</p>

<p>For cache locality reasons, I was expecting that packing the vectors one after the other [N][3] (row major) would yield better results than the layout [3][N] (in which dimensions X, Y then Z are laid out successively) when doing vectory operations using OpenMP.</p>

<p>However, multiplying each vector by a 3x3 matrix, and using Intel MKL BLAS, I found that the layout [3][N] is twice as fast.</p>

<p>I guess the cache locality is counter-balanced by the fact that SSE instructions work for non-strided data. This lead me to wonder how people (in computer graphics for instance) store their vectors and if there are other pros and cons.</p>

<p>A COM library that defines the following interface (no CoClass, just the interface):</p>

library ServiceLibrary
{

   interface IService;
   interface IServiceProvider;
};
</code></pre>

<p>I have a COM (written w/ C++) that implements both interfaces and provides our application(s) with said service.  All is fine, I think.</p>

<p>I'm trying to build a new <code>IProvider</code> and <code>IService</code> in .NET (C#).  </p>

<p>I've built a Primary Interop Assembly for the COM library, and implemented the following C#:</p>

<pre><code>[ComVisible( true )]
[Guid( ""xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"" )]
public interface INewService : IService
{
   //  adds a couple new properties
}

[ComVisible( true )]
[Guid( ""xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"" )]
public class NewService : INewService
{
   //  implement interface
}

[ComVisible( true )]
[Guid( ""xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"" )]
public interface INewProvider : IServiceProvider
{
   //  adds nothing, just implements
}

[ComVisible( true )]
[Guid( ""xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"" )]
public class NewProvider : INewProvider
{
   //  implement interface
}

<p>When I attempt to slip this into the existing runtime, I am able to create the <code>NewProvider</code> object from COM (C++), and <code>QueryInterface</code> for IServiceProvider. When I attempt to call a method on the IServiceProvider, a <code>System.ExecutionEngineException</code> is thrown.  </p>

<p>The only other thing I can find, is by looking at the .tlh files created by the #import, shows the legacy COM IExistingProvider class correctly shows that it is derived from IServiceProvider. However the .NET class shows a base of IDispatch.  I'm not sure if this a sign, indication, helpful, something else.</p>

<p>the crazy thing about it is when i empty the table ""Source"" then everything works fine and i get an empty list back without any exception.</p>

<p>Also its unclear for me that i can query against all 10 objects in my class set and the exception always hit the first attribute of the selected class. If i look into these classes the field are there. They are inside the abstract classes that the cayenne modeler generates and they have the exact name that the exception gives.</p>

<p>here is the source class on the client:</p>

    }

    Object oldValue = this.id;
    this.id = id;

<p>}</p>

<p>and this is the corresponding server class:</p>

After that I am checking if someone has clicked on their location and I want to return the color that the object contains. The problem is I always get the color green back. Probably because I reference to all the objects instead of a single one. I have searched through this site and found similar problems and tutorials. But I can not seem to find the information I need to fix the code so that I can reference to a single instance in the list while using a foreach loop to check them all.</p>

<p>After reading the answers and using break and the forgotten secondColor = true, I still have the same problem. Even when sending the clicked object to another function my problem is not solved. So instead of only showing the code for reading out the list I show the code for when the list is filled as well. How can I fix that I only refer to the green object at all times when reading the list but when using the for loop to draw I get every color????</p>

<ol>
<li>The rightmost &lt;div&gt; touches the right edge of the container,
contains nowrap text, and is as wide as necessary.</li>
<li>The center &lt;div&gt; is immediately to the left of the rightmost
&lt;div&gt;, contains an &lt;img&gt;, and is as wide as necessary.</li>
<li>The leftmost &lt;div&gt; touches the left edge of the container,
contains word-wrapped text, and uses a minimum width of say 20% but
dynamically stretches to use whatever remaining width is available
in the container.</li>
<li>A horizontal scrollbar should appear if (and only if) the sum of the
widths of the three columns is greater than the width of the
container. I don't want any of these &lt;div&gt;s moving down to the
next row.</li>

<p>I'm having trouble with #3 &amp; #4. Is this possible? I'm guessing I need the leftmost column to actually be two &lt;div&gt;s (one directly on top of the other), one empty &lt;div&gt; with 20% width above/under the other wrapped text &lt;div&gt; with unspecified width, but I can't figure out how to do that.

<p>1) I want to be able to tweak the effects and maybe create new custom effects of my own.</p>

<p>2) I want it to run fast as I want my app to be quick and responsive.</p>

<p>3) I want to use a library which is easiest to learn as I am not an expert in image proccesing.</p>

<p>Please help!</p>

<p>I changed this thread, because i recognized that I was searching for my problems' solution at the wrong end.</p>

<p>Here's my Problem:</p>

<p>I got a Class <strong>ProfileProposal</strong> which I upload an Image with(Using CarrierWave).
Now I want to convert <strong>ProfileProposal</strong> to another class, called <strong>Profile</strong>.
So I pass all the Information to the NEW-Form of <strong>Profile</strong>.</p>

<p>Works fine with strings, but not with Images.</p>

<p><strong>What I've already tried/done:</strong></p>

<p>Pass the Image as GET Param to the Create Method:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= form_for @profile, :url =&gt; { :action =&gt; ""create"", :controller =&gt; ""profiles"", :image =&gt; @profile_proposal.image } do |f| %&gt;

#
</code></pre>

<p>Which now works, so I DO have the image-url.</p>

<p>What's not working is the following:</p>

<pre><code>@profile = Profile.new(params[:profile], :image =&gt; new_image_url)
# OR
@profile.image = new_image_url
</code></pre>

<p>@profile.image still has the default value given by Carrierwave.</p>

<p>Scenario:<br>
When I do create manually a file-flag in system (for maintenance purpose)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>touch /var/state/technical</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this cuts-off calls to ""backend"", throws <strong>HTTP 503</strong> - that's perfect. <br>
Vhost apache code:</p>

    RewriteCond /var/state/technical -f
    RewriteRule ^/some_page.* http://127.0.0.1:1/ [P]

<p>That works like charm, but i can not distinguish between
<br>503 - on ""backend"" failure
<br>and
<br>503 - on ""technical"" maintenance </p>

<hr>

<p>My research for now:<br>
You can change ErrorDocument  on LocationMatch:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LocationMatch ^/some_url(.*)&gt;
    ErrorDocument 503 /technical_page.html
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>The 'ideal word' would works like: (this is bad apache syntax)</em></p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond /var/state/technical -f
ErrorDocument 503 /technical_page.html

<p>For Now:<br></p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond /var/state/technical -f
RewriteRule .* http://127.0.0.1:80/technical_page.html [PT]
</code></pre>

<p>works, but that returns <br>
<strong>HTTP 200</strong> response code.<br>
<strong>If</strong> I could override response code here, that would be enough.</p>

<p>I can not use simple redirect R=503<br></p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule !^/error|ping/.* /technical.html [PT,R=503]

<p>because it would display default 503 error page (<em>ErrorDocument 503 /some_error_page.html</em>)</p>

<p>When a user enters a password that is not of the required length all works well. But if a user then continues to confirm the password with the same value as the previous password it will come up with passwords match as expected. But as the first one is incorrect they go back and change the first but the second still says it is a match how can I make it check it again if the value of id password is changed??</p>

<p>Same with email, if this makes sense??</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are problems if the rallygrid is hidden when the container is first rendered if I include the rallypercentdonepopoverplugin plugin:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using a tab panel, rallygrids in an inactive panel crash when they are rendered if they contain the rallypercentdonepopoverplugin and display a field that uses it.</li>
<li>Using an accordion panel, if a grid is not open when it is first rendered (set 'collapsed: true' on the gridspec), the popup for % done does not display.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there perhaps a tricky way to get this to work, perhaps changing the timing on when objects are created?</p>

<p>My app requires are:</p>

<pre><code>requires: [
    'Rally.data.util.Sorter',
    'Rally.data.wsapi.Filter',
    'Rally.ui.grid.Grid',
    'Rally.data.ModelFactory',
    'Rally.ui.grid.plugin.PercentDonePopoverPlugin'
],
</code></pre>

<p>The gridspec plugins include:</p>

<pre><code>plugins: ['rallypercentdonepopoverplugin']
</code></pre>

<p>Other than that, at the low level just a pretty straight forward rallygrid showing feature level portfolio items, plus the boolean 'collapsed: true' if it is not supposed to open during render</p>

<p>And the following subroutines to layout the system of panels:</p>

<pre><code>_createTabPanel: function() {
    var curAccord   = this._createAccordian('current');
    var pastAccord  = this._createAccordian('past');

    curAccord.title     = 'Upcoming Releases';
    pastAccord.title    = 'Previous Releases';

    var tabPanelSpec = {
        xtype: 'tabpanel',
        border: 0,
        forceFit: true,
        activeTab: 0,
        minTabWidth: 200,
        items: [curAccord, pastAccord]
    };

    return tabPanelSpec;
},

_createAccordian: function(displayType) {
    var gridSpecs   = this._getGridSpecs(displayType);

<p><strong>==Update==</strong></p>

<p>i have form1 which contains this code to add richtextboxes and tabs to tabcontrl</p>

<pre><code>Dim myTabPage As New TabPage()
Dim myrichtext As New RichTextBox()
myrichtext.Name = ""RichTextBox"" &amp; i
myTabPage.Text = StrSearch &amp; i

myrichtext.RightToLeft = Windows.Forms.RightToLeft.No
myrichtext.Dock = DockStyle.Fill
myrichtext.Font = New Font(""Urdulink"", 14)

<p>And finally open frmdict to show meaning</p>

<pre><code>If frmdict.TabControl1.TabPages.Count &gt; 0 Then
  frmdict.TabControl1.RightToLeftLayout = True
  frmdict.Show()

I now need to begin using <a href=""http://www.zipline.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zipline.io/</a> which only supports Anaconda 32bit. Is there a way to have both the 32 and 64 bit versions installed and just tell Pycharm which one to use for a specific project?</p>

<p>Pycharm supports the creation of virtualenv environments from within the IDE, perhaps something can be done in that way? I've never used virtual environments before. Or would it be possible to just install Anaconda 32bit into it's own folder, then tell Pycharm which to use for each project.</p>

<p>Any advice is appreciated.</p>

<p>I have installed Anaconda 32 bit in a separate folder and selected this version from within Pycharm settings for the interpreter. When trying to run a basic zipline project I get the following error:</p>

Process finished with exit code 1
</code></pre>

<p>It's worth noting that in my code, Pycharm has highlighted my import statement as having an error (with 'order' as well as 'record'). However there is nothing wrong with the import:</p>

<pre><code>from zipline.api import order, record, symbol
</code></pre>

<p>The error is:</p>

<pre><code>Unresolved reference 'order'
This inspection detects names that should resolve but dont.
Due to dynamic dispatch and duck typing, this is possible in a limited
but useful number of cases, Top-level and class-level items are supported
better than instance items.
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas on what I might be doing incorrectly? I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling zipline which hasn't helped. It seems like there is some sort of conflict with my prior 64bit stuff with the new 32bit stuff.</p>

<p>I recently started programming OpenGL ES on an Android smartphone and ran into problems understanding how gluPerspective and gluLookAt are used. I <em>think</em> I understand what they do, however I cannot see the triangle I draw. I run the following code in the onDrawFrame-method of my activity. Said activity implements GLSurfaceView.Renderer with the onDrawFrame marked with @Override. My code is:</p>

<pre><code>gl.glViewport(0, 0, screen_width, screen_height);
gl.glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.5f); //set background to black
gl.glClearDepthf(1.0f); 

gl.glClear(GL10.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL10.GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

gl.glMatrixMode(GL10.GL_PROJECTION); // Change PROJECTION matrix
gl.glLoadIdentity();

float aspect_ratio = (float) screen_width / screen_height;
GLU.gluPerspective(gl, 67, aspect_ratio, 1, 100);

gl.glEnable(GL10.GL_DEPTH_TEST);
gl.glMatrixMode(GL10.GL_MODELVIEW); // Change MODELVIEW matrix
gl.glLoadIdentity();

GLU.gluLookAt(gl, 0, 0, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0);

// make triangle with vertices (-2,0,0), (2,0,0), and (0,.5,0)
float[] vertices = { -2f, 0, 0, 2f, 0, 0, 0, .5f, 0 };
ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(vertices.length * 4);
buffer.order(ByteOrder.nativeOrder());
FloatBuffer vertex_buffer = buffer.asFloatBuffer();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 9; i++) {
    vertex_buffer.put(vertices[i]);
}

gl.glEnableClientState(GL10.GL_VERTEX_ARRAY);
gl.glVertexPointer(3, GL10.GL_FLOAT, 0, vertex_buffer);
gl.glDrawArrays(GL10.GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
gl.glDisableClientState(GL10.GL_VERTEX_ARRAY);
gl.glDisable(GL10.GL_DEPTH_TEST);
</code></pre>

<p>The next points are short notes on what I putatively know about camera settings in the above code. PLEASE correct me if I got something wrong in the following explanations, as that might already solve all of my issues!</p>

<ol>
<li>glMatrixMode(GL10.GL_PROJECTION) switches to changing the camera matrix (for which I load an identity matrix directly afterwards)</li>
<li>GLU.gluPerspective(gl, 67, aspect_ratio, 1, 100) sets a perspective projection with a view frustrum of 67 degree view angle in the y-dimension. Using ""aspect_ration=(float)width/height"" OpenGL computes the view angle in the x-dimension. Further the ""1"" is the near clipping plane, while ""100"" is the value of the far clipping plane in this case.</li>
<li>As far as I know it does not matter, where in the code gluLookAt is called, as long as it is done before the actual drawing (I'm unsure about this though). In this example I change to the MODELVIEW matrix first, load an identity matrix, and then gluLookAt is called.
3.</li>
<li>""GLU.gluLookAt(gl, 0, 0, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0)"" actually consists of three 3-element vectors. The initial one ((0,0,20) in this example) sets the position of the camera in world coordinates (i.e. 20 units on the positive Z-axis, which means it is ""sticking out"" of the front of the phone's screen). The second vector determines the point in the world coordinate system the camera looks at (in this example the origin of the coordinate system, i.e. the camera looks along the negative z-axis). The third vector is the up-vector that defines the direction of the y-Axis of the cameras coordinate system (and therefore also the x-axis via cross product with the vector from camera position to the point it looks at).</li>
</ol>

<p>The triangle drawing code was copied from a tutorial (but I found similar code also in other tutorials, so I assume this is not the problem).</p>

<p>As far as I get it, the camera is now positioned on (0,0,20) and looks towards the origin of the coordinate system. Its drawing frustrum starts at z-value 19 and goes as far as -80 (the camera is at z-axis point 20 and looks along the negative z-axis; its viewing frustrum has near and far plane at 1 and 100 (both looking along the negative z-axis in this case), respectively). Therefore, the triangle should be visible, as its vertices are positioned around the origin on the z-axis=0 plane (i.e. the xy-plane), which is clearly within the viewing frustrum. Further the drawn vertices are arranged in counter-clockwise order; the default in OpenGL.</p>

<p>So after this long introduction into the problem my simple question is: What did I mess up so that this code does not do what I expect it to?</p>

<p>And here's my emberjs code :</p>

<pre><code>//models/building.js
export default DS.Model.extend({
    type: DS.attr('string'),
    address: DS.belongsTo('address', {embedded: 'always'}),
    cost: DS.attr('number'),
    yearOfBuilt: DS.attr('number'),
    earnings: DS.attr('number'),
    createdDateTime: DS.attr('date'),
    mainPicturePath: DS.attr('string')
});

//models/address.js
export default DS.Model.extend({
    civicNumber: DS.attr('number'),
    streetName: DS.attr('string'),
    city: DS.attr('string'),
    provinceOrState: DS.attr('string'),
    country: DS.attr('string'),

    building: DS.belongsTo('building', {embedded: 'always'})
});

//serializers/building.js
export default DS.RESTSerializer.extend(DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin, {
    attrs: {
        address: {embedded: 'always'}
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't throw any errors and works fine. The problem is, I don't fully understand the code for the embedded object <em>address</em> in <em>building</em> (I do understand how the DS models, the <em>export</em> from ember-cli and the <em>belongsTo</em> work). Could someone explains me in details how does it works (the RESTSerializer with EmbeddedRecordsMixin, the {embedded: 'always'} attribute and the other available options)? Any clarifications will be more than appreciated.</p>

<p>Lets also bring this to the next level, say I do not want to have an id for each address since they should never be used more than once (cannot have 2 buildings at the same address). How would I achieve that? Maybe I will store the address in the same record of my building object in the db and don't want an extra table for addresses. Based on these solutions, what would be the best approach (feel free to propose better solution if you have)?</p>

<p>It makes the application crash with the following message:</p>

<pre><code>-[__NSCFDictionary setObject:forKey:]: attempt to insert nil value (key: _NSTaskExecutablePath)

<p>What have I done wrong? Is there Any example application demonstrating it?</p>

<p>But, in order to match the styleguide a client uses for their printed materials, I've been asked for a different format than what can be achieved using the basic customizations. </p>

<p>Their styleguide states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Times</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Correct: 6p, 7 - 830a, 8a - 5p.</li>
  <li>Never include the colon. (Do: 830 - 945p.)</li>
  <li>If the time is at the top of the hour, drop the 00 at the end of the time. (Do: 8 - 9p.)</li>
  <li>Use the lowercase letter “a” to indicate a.m. and the lowercase letter “p” to indicate p.m. with no spaces between the numbers and
  letters. (Do: 9 - 1030p.) </li>
  <li>For spans of time, use a hyphen (-) with a space on each side of it. (Do: 8 - 930p.)</li>
  <li>Never use noon or midnight. (Do: 12a or 12p.)</li>
  <li>Avoid redundancies like morning or evening. (Don’t: 8a in the morning or 7p Tuesday evening.)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I am using using the Event Calendar Pro plugin as the calendar on the site and by using the custom time format of
""gia"" I can get the times to display as ""July 25 @ 800am - 300pm"" but I need to be able to drop the letter ""m' from the ""am"" and ""pm"" and the ""00"" from times at the top of hours.</p>

<p>I'm assuming this can all be achieved with a little code in my functions.php file, but I'm not sure where to start, everything I've found in searching the forms regarding time formats just points me to the basic php time customizations.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated (besides telling me that the client's time formats are messed up and confusing to site users.)</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) 
{
    File file = new File( ""c:\\temp\\file.txt"" );
    file.delete();
    FileOutputStream outStream = null;

    } catch (IOException e) 
    {
        // TODO Auto-generated catch block

    }
}

<p>When I open the file in a hex editor I get <code>00 9e f3 04</code> as the contents instead of the bytes that I sent. My results seem to be inconsistent. Sometimes I get the expected result and sometimes I do not.</p>

<hr>

<p>This will output the correct data:</p>

<p><code>outStream.write( new byte[] { 0x14 , 0x00, 0x1F, 0x50, (byte) 0xE0, 0x4F, (byte) 0xD0, 0x20, (byte) 0xEA, 0x3A, 0x69, 0x10, (byte) 0xA2 , (byte) 0xD8, 0x08, 0x00, 0x2B } );</code></p>

<p>File contents are:</p>

<pre><code>14 00 1f 50 e0 4f d0 20 ea 3a 69 10 a2 d8 08 00 2b
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If I add one more byte to that array then it fails.</p>

<p><code>outStream.write( new byte[] { 0x14 , 0x00, 0x1F, 0x50, (byte) 0xE0, 0x4F, (byte) 0xD0, 0x20, (byte) 0xEA, 0x3A, 0x69, 0x10, (byte) 0xA2 , (byte) 0xD8, 0x08, 0x00, 0x2B, 0x30 } );</code></p>

<p>File contents are now:</p>

<pre><code>14 e5 80 9f e4 bf a0 e2 83 90 e3 ab aa e1 81 a9 ed a2 a2 08 e3 80 ab
</code></pre>

<p>I also had trouble with this one:</p>

<pre><code>outStream.write( new byte[] { 0x4C, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 } );

<p>File contents are:</p>

<pre><code>4c 00

<p>The last two bytes are not written.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>outStream.write( new byte[] { 0x4C, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01 } );
</code></pre>

<p>This will produce the expected result. File contents are:</p>

<pre><code>4c 00 00 00 01
</code></pre>

<p>I feel like I am missing something fundamental about the way data is written to files. How can get consistent results when writing byte arrays to a file?</p>

This process involves first being logged on a remote server (A).
From server A, a user would connect to Remote Server (B).</p>

<ol>
<li>Change a file name in a local directory.</li>
<li>Open command prompt and perform ""iisreset""</li>
<li>Open Internet explorer to ensure the connection with IIS is re-established.</li>

The codes uses the <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383022(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">ActiveX MSTSC Library</a>.</p>

<p>My question lies in the steps outlined above.
Once connected to Server B, how do I pragmatically perform these operations.
Right now, We do have an internal script which performs these steps.
To execute the script, the user must log onto Server B and manually run the Script.</p>

<p>If it's possible to make the connections and to execute the script pragmatically this would be a solution. If for some reason this is not possible, I would need to perform the three steps pragmatically as a solution instead.</p>

I need to create a heatmap in R and have a dataset that has certain attribute and longitude and latitude columns for Washington DC metro area. I used ggmap to import a map for Washington DC and then added the plot of my dataset on top of that. The map looks great. Now I need to create a shapefile of this plot and export it in ArcGIS format. I looked around but I couldn't find tutorials or help pages on exactly what I want to do. Here's the code I used:</p>

<pre><code>library(ggmap)
library(ggplot2)

myLocation &lt;- ""Washington DC""
#Getting a map of Washington DC metro area from google API
myMap &lt;- get_map(location=myLocation, source=""google"", maptype=""terrain"", crop=""FALSE"")
ggmap(myMap) #maps the Washington DC map
zoom=5

#This plot the heatmap
ggmap(myMap) + 
  geom_density2d(data = mydata, 
                 aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), size = 0.3) + 
  stat_density2d(data = mydata, 
                 aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, fill = ..level.., 
                     alpha = ..level..), size = 0.01, bins = 16, geom = ""polygon"") + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = ""green"", high = ""red"") + 
  scale_alpha(range = c(0, 0.3), guide = FALSE)

    response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/event-stream'

    logger.info ""Stream closed""
  ensure

<p>Here the JS part to listen to the stream:</p>

<pre><code>var source = new EventSource(""/stream?user_id="" + user_id);
source.addEventListener(""message"", function(e) {
  data = jQuery.parseJSON(e.data);

  switch(data.type) {

<p><code>ThreadError: Attempt to unlock a mutex which is locked by another thread</code></p>

<p>The problem can be solved after adding <code>config.middleware.delete Rack::Lock</code> to development.rb, but then I don't see any console output after pushing to the client. <code>config.cache_classes = true</code> and <code>config.eager_load = true</code>are no options, because I don't want to restart my server every time in development.</p>

<p>The document adds validation lists to some cells based on a named range in another worksheet in the same workbook. This currently works, but very slowly.</p>

<p>Now to the question; How can I speed this up? When the sheet is at its largest it takes over a minute to complete the code, and since that happens when you open the sheet, people using the sheet are complaining. :)</p>

<p>I have tested to just comment out the row where the validation is added, so I'm fairly sure that row is the time consumer (mostly). I would take any suggestions.</p>

<p>Normally the listView replaces to big text items with ""dot dot dot"" at the end so that they fit on the screen. In my case it still does that, but the text has way to many characters, before the shortening is happening. The result is, that everything scales down. How should I solve this?</p>

<pre><code>[TestCase]

<p>There's a form mapped to URL: <code>/foo/create</code>. When user type in this URL to his browser the form is shown.</p>

<p>Form action attribute directs to <code>/foo/save</code> and has method <code>POST</code>. If saving is successful, then standard post-redirect-get pattern is applied, and user is redirected to <code>/foo/show</code>.</p>

<p>But, if user specified incorrect data, they should see the same form again with error messages and all their data preserved. To implement this behavior, I do <code>forward</code> to the controller which produces the form (the same is mapped to <code>/foo/create</code>).</p>

<p>After that user sees the form with data and error messages, but URL field is changed in browser to <code>/foo/save</code>. And if user change focus to URL field and press enter - 404 will be shown (because nothing is mapped to <code>/foo/save</code> + <code>method=GET</code> pair).</p>

<p><strong>The long story short</strong>: URL <code>/foo/save</code> is shown in a browser (as there were no redirection after form was submitted) but it directs to nowhere if accessed by HTTP GET method.</p>

<p>This works amazingly well until I want to add the html <code>selected</code> attribute to certain options that are pulled from another table.</p>

<pre><code>    $data['get_custom_reg'] = $this-&gt;db-&gt;query(""
    SELECT custom_field_id, custom_field_value_id
    FROM projects_custom_fields_reg
    WHERE project_id = $project_id
        "");
</code></pre>

<p>Myself and another experienced programmer have been playing with a few ways to achieve this.</p>

<p>Using an array with a counter (this worked great but we couldn't increment the counter within the query) coupled with an IF statement</p>

<p>Our fallback option is to get rid of the single MYSQL query using GROUP_CONCAT and using multiple database calls and several PHP statements to output the code.</p>

<p>All help would be greatly appreciated as we have really hit a brick wall.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Assuming my script is named <strong>script.bat</strong>, it needs to support the following as legal command-line parameters:</p>

<pre><code>C:\&gt; script.bat C:
C:\&gt; script.bat C:\
C:\&gt; script.bat ..\photos
C:\&gt; script.bat C:\WINDOWS
C:\&gt; script.bat ""C:\Documents and Settings""
C:\&gt; script.bat ""C:\Documents and Settings\""
C:\&gt; script.bat F:\music\data\
C:\&gt; ...
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, it must be legal to give a drive letter, with or without a trailing backslash as well as the full, absolute or relative path name, with or without a trailing backslash (and with or without spaces in some of the directory name(s)). The name <em>MUST</em> be quoted, obviously, if it contains spaces so as to be interpreted as one parameter. However, quotes should be allowed on names where they're not otherwise required:</p>

<pre><code>C:\&gt; script.bat ""F:\music\data\""
</code></pre>

<p>My first attempt looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>@ECHO OFF
SETLOCAL EnableExtensions EnableDelayedExpansion
IF ErrorLevel 1 GOTO :NoExtensions
IF ""%~1""=="""" GOTO :NoDirectory

SET dir=%~1\NUL
ECHO You provided:  %1
ECHO Testing using: %dir%
IF NOT EXIST %dir% GOTO :BadDirectory
SET dir=%~f1\
ECHO The following is valid: %dir%

REM
REM Other script stuff here...
REM

GOTO :EOF
:NoExtensions
    ECHO This batch script requires extensions!
    GOTO :EOF
:NoDirectory
    ECHO You must provide a directory to validate!
    GOTO :EOF
:BadDirectory
    ECHO The directory you specified is invalid!
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>main</em> problem is that it doesn't work when a path with embedded spaces is specified:</p>

<pre><code>C:\script.bat ""C:\Documents and Settings""
...
'and' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</code></pre>

<p>So, I tried quoting the %dir% variable as follows:</p>

<pre><code>IF NOT EXIST ""%dir%"" GOTO :BadDirectory
</code></pre>

<p>Quoting as above seems to work when using ""IF NOT EXIST"" to check for files directly, but it doesn't work at all when using the ""dir\NUL"" trick to check for directories.</p>

<p>Another glitch in the original version is that if %1 is C: then the %~f1 version of the variable always seems to yield my current working directory instead of C: or C:\ as would be more useful. I'm not really sure of the best way to work around this either.</p>

<p>Any help or comments will be <em>greatly</em> appreciated!</p>

The location is in the application's documents directory, and the file seems to be there (per Xcode Organizer). This is how I determine the path to write out to:</p>

<pre><code>// setup our file write area
//
NSArray *dirs = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);
NSString *documentsDirectoryPath = [dirs objectAtIndex:0];
NSString *exportPath = [[documentsDirectoryPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""exported.caf""] retain];
NSURL *exportURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:exportPath];
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I'm trying to read the file thusly:</p>

<pre><code>CFStringRef aCFString = (CFStringRef) [exportURL absoluteString];
CFURLRef sndFile = CFURLCreateWithFileSystemPath(kCFAllocatorDefault, aCFString, kCFURLPOSIXPathStyle, false);
OSStatus result = AudioFileOpenURL(sndFile, kAudioFileReadPermission, kAudioFileCAFType, &amp;fileID);
</code></pre>

<p>However, the result from this operation is -43, which per MacErrors.h is a file not found. I initially thought it could be a variant of this question:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2355911/audiofileopenurl-returns-43-on-an-existing-file"">AudioFileOpenURL returns -43 on an existing file</a></p>

<p>But now I don't think so. The file handles that created the PCM <em>should</em> be closed. Anyone have any ideas? Am I doing something really stupid here?</p>

<p>In the MVC app I create the WCF service and I consume it on the SL app. So far so good.</p>

<p>I deploy the project using the Web deploy and it works on my remote host but using Fiddler I realize that the remote app is using the WCF service I have on the development server (AKA localhost:port).</p>

<p>I changed the WCF service in VS and it now points to the remote host and if I deploy the solution, so far so good.</p>

<p>But you know, now my service points to a remote server and doesn't work because I have to create the xml for crossdomain access (and fiddler says to me that is looking on domain.com/crossdomain.xml instead of domain.com/virtualdirectory/crossdomain.xml).</p>

<p>So my question is: How I handle this? Would be good to have my project using the local service and when I deploy, it use the remote one.</p>

While I understand how it is, on the outset, helpful coming from Cocoa over to keep this convention, it seems to me that it would be both more productive and wise to use underscore word separation as per standard Ruby convention.  Is there a way to already do this or is there another way of attacking this issue?  </p>

<p>ActiveSupport supports this conversion.  I see something from <a href=""http://rubymotion.github.io/BubbleWrap/"" rel=""nofollow"">BubbleWrap</a> that has <code>camelize</code> and <code>underscore</code> methods, but obviously it's not really aimed at this particular use case.</p>

<p>It seems as though if this is not something that the RubyMotion folks will provide themselves, perhaps we could write a wrapper method so that there is a way to trigger a precompilation pass through to make this conversion?</p>

The issue I am having is that once imported, the data will not have the customer ID attached to it so the cust_ID field in the table will be null. What I need is a macro that will ask the user who the customer is for each import and then find that customer's ID and put that value into all of the null fields. I have made a lot of different attempts at this (mostly though the macro builder I don't even know where to start with the VBA for this) none of which have shown any results. I think my latest one is close but for some reason it isn't running after the import. I have an ""After Insert"" macro, and the idea was that it would prompt the user for [Customer Name]
look-up the custID from TBL_Customers then insert that into each of the null fields. Unfortunately after I import my data nothing happens and I'm really not sure why.</p>

<pre><code>Parameters Name: Customer Name

Look Up A Record In TBL_Customers
Where Condition =[TBL_Customers].[FLD_Customer_Name]=[Customer Name]
Alias custName

Look Up A Record In TBL_Customers
    Where Condition =[TBL_Customers].[FLD_Customer_PK_ID]=[custName]
    Alias custID

For Each Record In TBL_Contacts
Where condition =IsNull([FLD_Contact_FK_Customer_ID])

EditRecord
    SetField
        Name FLD_Contact_FK_Customer_ID
        Value =[custID]
End EditRecord 
</code></pre>

<p>Another possibility I was thinking would be to have another column in the excel sheet with the customer's name and then Access would just have to look up the cust_ID based on that column. My issue there is I don't know how I would tell Access to import the customer name from the excel sheet find that customer's ID and insert that ID into the proper table, which is why I was leaning toward the first option.</p>

<p>As I said in the comments I've tried a lot of different things but I'm fairly new to VBA/Access and am running out of ideas to try.
Not sure which would be easier/better so any ideas/suggestions/recommendations are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I work in a call center, where call records are stored in a History table.  The way the business works, is that an agent (Agent1) takes a call, speaks to the customer then transfers that call to some random second agent (Agent2) for them to close the sale. </p>

<p>In SQL, what the data shows is that the first agent spoke to the customer, and then the call ended with no Disposition.  The second record shows a new call, with a new HistoryID, and it shows Agent1 and Agent2 in the agent field. </p>

<p>Here is an example of how data is laid out:</p>

<pre><code>HistoryID| CallID  |   Date                |  Data                   |  Agent

<p>Agent1 &amp; Agent2 would actually be the agents first name, last initial so Agent1 = bobs, Agent2 = annb.  There can be many agents involved, so the names of Agent1 and Agent2 will most likely always be different.</p>

<p>I'm attempting to do some reporting, primarily on the Agent2
Examples of report would be:</p>

Both the site and the magento-shop has their own logins, therefor when a user logs in it is important that both are synchronized. This was done with an ajax-call each page reload, keeping the user logged into Magento. I want to remove this so I created a check on each page reload which will do everything server-side. </p>

"29550936","1","","","2015-04-09 23:43:59","","2","508","<p>I'm creating a subclass of <code>MKAnnotationView</code> in my project. It needs to have two properties for storing subviews which I need to initialize somewhere at the beginning.</p>

<p><code>MKAnnotationView</code> has one initializer listed in its documentation, <code>initWithAnnotation:reuseIdentifier:</code>, so I figured I'd simply override that:</p>

<pre><code>class PulsatingDotMarker: MKAnnotationView {

    let innerCircle: UIView
    let outerCircle: UIView

    override init!(annotation: MKAnnotation!, reuseIdentifier: String!) {
        innerCircle = ...
        outerCircle = ...

        super.init(annotation: annotation, reuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier)
    }

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this causes a runtime exception:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>fatal error: use of unimplemented initializer 'init(frame:)' for class 'PulsatingDotMarker'</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, so I guess <code>initWithAnnotation:reuseIdentifier:</code> internally calls <code>initWithFrame:</code>, so it's probably that one that I should override instead. Let's try that:</p>

<pre><code>class PulsatingDotMarker: MKAnnotationView {

    let innerCircle: UIView
    let outerCircle: UIView

    override init(frame: CGRect) {
        innerCircle = ...
        outerCircle = ...

        super.init(frame: frame)
    }

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This however causes a compile error when creating the annotation view object:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Extra argument 'reuseIdentifier' in call</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm, so if I implement the (required) initializer <code>initWithFrame:</code>, it now loses the default initializer <code>initWithAnnotation:reuseIdentifier:</code>?</p>

<p>Maybe if I added an override of <code>initWithAnnotation:reuseIdentifier:</code> that just calls <code>super</code> it will be available again, will that work?</p>

<pre><code>class PulsatingDotMarker: MKAnnotationView {

    let innerCircle: UIView
    let outerCircle: UIView

    init!(annotation: MKAnnotation!, reuseIdentifier: String!) {
        super.init(annotation: annotation, reuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier)
    }

    override init(frame: CGRect) {
        innerCircle = ...
        outerCircle = ...

        super.init(frame: frame)
    }

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Nope, still not good - compile error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Property 'self.innerCircle' not initialized at super.init call</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, what if I had an <code>initWithFrame:</code>, but initialized the subviews in <code>initWithAnnotation:reuseIdentifier:</code>? (But then what if someone just calls <code>initWithFrame:</code> directly?...)</p>

<pre><code>class PulsatingDotMarker: MKAnnotationView {

    let innerCircle: UIView
    let outerCircle: UIView

    init!(annotation: MKAnnotation!, reuseIdentifier: String!) {
        innerCircle = ...
        outerCircle = ...

        super.init(annotation: annotation, reuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier)
    }

    override init(frame: CGRect) {
        super.init(frame: frame)
    }

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Not surprisingly, Swift protects me from that by telling me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Property 'self.innerCircle' not initialized at super.init call</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(this time in <code>initWithFrame:</code>).</p>

<p>So what am I supposed to do? I can't create the subviews both here and there, right?</p>

<pre><code>class PulsatingDotMarker: MKAnnotationView {

    let innerCircle: UIView
    let outerCircle: UIView

    init!(annotation: MKAnnotation!, reuseIdentifier: String!) {
        innerCircle = ...
        outerCircle = ...

        super.init(annotation: annotation, reuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier)
    }

    override init(frame: CGRect) {
        innerCircle = ...
        outerCircle = ...

        super.init(frame: frame)
    }

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Wrong again, this actually works - even though I'm assigning a constant property twice in the same object (!).</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea how this should be done properly?</p>

<p>(Note: the class also included a required <code>initWithCoder:</code> initializer that just calls <code>fatalError</code> from the first example, but the object is never created from a storyboard.)</p>

<p>Using an async read on the client (i.e. BeginRead()), the ReadCallback is repeatedly called with <strong>exactly the same size chunk of data</strong> up until the final packet (the remainder of the data). With the data I'm sending (it's a zip file), the segments happen to be 16363 bytes long. <strong>Note</strong>: My receive buffer is much bigger than this and changing it's size has no effect</p>

<p>I understand that SSL encrypts data in chunks no bigger than 18Kb, but since SSL sits on top of TCP, I wouldn't think that the number of SSL chunks would have any relevance to the TCP packet fragmentation? </p>

<p>Essentially, the data is taking about 20 times longer to be fully read by the client than with a standard NetworkStream (both on localhost!)</p>

<p>What am I missing? </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I'm beginning to suspect that the receive (or send) buffer size of an SSLStream is limited. Even if I use synchronous reads (i.e. SSLStream.Read()), no more data ever becomes available, regardless of how long I wait before attempting to read. This would be the same behavior as if I were to limit the receive buffer to 16363 bytes. Setting the Underlying NetworkStream's SendBufferSize (on the server), and ReceiveBufferSize (on the client) has no effect. </p>

<p>I am interested in the answer for C99 and for C11 if there is reason to think that it is different there.</p>

<p>In C99, all I found was 6.5:2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its
  stored value  modiﬁed at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
  [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not clear for me what consequences this paragraph has on the program above.</p>

<p>Based on a large number of randomized tests, most compilers appear to generate code where the two assignments do not interfere.</p>

<p>In the method <code>CreateGenericList()</code>, I have a variable <code>v</code> of type <code>A</code>, which is in fact either a <code>B</code>, a <code>C</code> or another child type and I want to create a generic list of the proper type, i.e. <code>List&lt;B&gt;</code> if <code>v</code> is a <code>B</code> or <code>List&lt;C&gt;</code> if <code>v</code> is a <code>C</code>, ...</p>

<p>Currently I do it by using reflection, which works, but this is extremely slow. I wanted to know if there is another way to do it, which doesn't use reflection.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the code of my problem:</p>

<pre><code>class A { }  
class B : A { }  
class C : A { }
// More childs of A.

<p>I tried the following hack. I call the following method, hoping the type inferencer would  guess the type of <code>model</code>, but it doesn't work and returns a <code>List&lt;A&gt;</code>. I believe that because c# is statically typed, <code>T</code> is resolved as an <code>A</code> and not as the real type of <code>model</code> at run-time.</p>

<p>Here is the solution, see Stoive's answer for explanations.</p>

<pre><code>  obj = $.parseJSON(json.trim());
    $.each(obj,function(index,element){

<p>The flow is such that I have a mobile app that generates the token for me (by authenticating through Google plus native SDK), then I send the token to my node server and I want to get the details about the user from Google. I tried the following (assuming I have the <code>access_token</code> from the client):</p>

<pre><code>var request = require('request');

request('https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo?access_token=' + access_token, function(err, res, body) {
  if (err) return callback(err);

  if (res.statusCode != 200) {
    return callback(new Error('Invalid access token: ' + body));
  }
  else {
    var me;
    try { me = JSON.parse(body);}

    catch (e) {
      return callback(new Error('Unable to parse user data: ' + e.toString()));
    }

    console.log('user profile:', me);
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but sometimes I get bad response like null <code>displayName</code> field, null <code>email</code> (even though I have the scope) and it's unreliable overall.</p>

<p>I have tried using <a href=""https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client"" rel=""nofollow"">Google API Node module</a> but the flow there assumes I need to get token and is unnecessarily complicated. </p>

<p>Other than that, I don't understand the difference between Google's API versions and don't know when to use what.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>It seems that the problem with null <code>displayName</code> field only happens with tokens that were generated through the iOS SDK. Tokens generated with Android SDK are fine and calling the API with them resolves in <code>displayName</code>. I tried taking the iOS token and calling the following API :</p>

<pre><code>https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/people/me?access_token=...
</code></pre>

<p>I got a <code>displayName</code> in the result, but after a couple of calls from my server I got </p>

For the project I am working on, I don't have controle over when the tooltip is initiated nor is there an available callback so I am using jQuery .on('mouseenter') to initialize my event.</p>

<p>Anything I put within the initialize function works, but my click event wont fire. From what I have read, if el is defined then standard events (click) should automatically be bound but that is not happening and as far as I can tell this should be working correctly.</p>

<p>javascript:</p>

<pre><code>Lot = Backbone.View.extend({
    initialize: function(){
        this.wrapper = $(this.$el).find('.childDiv');
        $(this.$el).css('background-color', 'blue');
        console.log('init');
    },
    events: {
      'click .showChild': 'showfunction'
    },
    showfunction:function(e){
         this.wrapper.slideToggle('fast');   
    }
});

//gives the auto generated tooltip a class, otherwise it would be classless
$.balloon.defaults.classname = ""balloon"";

//tooltip needs content passed in, the tooltip creator recommends using clone
$('#showParent')
   .balloon({contents: $('.tooltip-content').clone(), position: ""bottom right"" });

// this may look redundant, but I do not have access to the initialize function
$('#showParent').on('mouseenter', function() {
    console.log('mouse enter');
    lots = new Lot({el: $('.balloon .tooltip-content')});
});
</code></pre>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button id=""showParent""&gt;Hover&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;div id=""wrapper""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""parentDiv tooltip-content""&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt; Some text to test parent&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;button class=""showChild""&gt;Click&lt;/button&gt;

}

- (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {

        UIAlertView *alertView = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:nil message:nil delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:@""Dismiss"" otherButtonTitles:nil];
        [alertView show];
    }
    else {
        [self becomeFirstResponder];
    }
}

<p><em><strong>MyKeyboard.m</em></strong> :</p>

<pre><code>#import ""MyKeyboard.h""

@implementation MyKeyboard

    static MyKeyboard *sharedKeyboard;
    if (sharedKeyboard == nil) {
        sharedKeyboard = [[MyKeyboard alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 1, 1)];
    }
    return sharedKeyboard;
}

- (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame {

<p>The test steps are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Launch the app.</li>
<li>Tap the editor, and the keyboard will show.</li>
<li>Verify that you can not move the keyboard by dragging the lower-right corner of it.</li>
<li>Tap the editor again, the keyboard will hide, and an alert view will show.</li>
<li>Dismiss the alert view.</li>
<li>Tap the editor a third time, and the keyboard will show.</li>
<li>Verify that now you can move the keyboard by dragging the lower-right corner of it.</li>

I have included the SWF files etc in the Contents folder and referenced it from my view, the flash file loads when you get to the view, great.</p>

<p>The problem occurs because the flash file references and XML file for its configuration data, and I'm getting an error accessing that XML file. I'm guessing this is because flash is looking for a relative path and is using the URL for the page, which is obviously an MVC url and so does not refer to an actual location on disk, so the XML file is not there.</p>

<p>I guess the obvious answer is the alter the flash file to look in the contents folder for the XML file, but that means re-compiling the flash, and I know very little about flash so I'd like to avoid doing that. So is there any way to get the XML file to show up in the same URL as the view, so at the moment, the page with the flash component on is located at htttp://localhost/upload/ so I guess the XML file needs to be accessible from <a href=""http://localhost/upload/flash-settings.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/upload/flash-settings.xml</a>? </p>

<p>Sorry for the Long Post here.  This log was generated using the -Dsun.security.ssl.allowUnsafeRenegotiation=true switch, but it made no difference. </p>

<p>The code has some custom classes, but there's no magic here.  The configuration is in property files and loaded at runtime, parameters should be pretty self explanatory.</p>

<p>I have been plowing through various threads, trying to figure out the answer.  I don't want to disable (accept all certificates) solution.  I haven't tried the custom SSL socket factory for explicitly setting SSLv3 negotiation.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>socket.setEnabledProtocols(new String[] { ""SSLv3"" });</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This site does have a user id and password in order to download data, and does have cookies, but again, this does work under JRE 6.  </p>

<p>basically I have a calculation that takes the long and lat from the feed and works out how far  the poi is from my current location of which then I sort the array by using a sort descriptor based on the distance key that I want to insert above.

<p>Basically, I need a hashing function where:</p>

<pre><code>hash(a, b) = c
hash(b, a) = c
</code></pre>

<p>Where acceptable inputs for a and b are unsigned 32-bit integers. The hashing function should return an unsigned 64-bit integer. Collision (i.e. hash(a, b) = c and hash(d, f) = c as well) is not desirable as these values will be used in a binary search tree. The result of the search is a linked list of possible results that is then iterated over where a and b are actually compared. So some collision is acceptable, but the less collisions, the less iterations required, and the faster it will run.</p>

<p>Performance is also of extreme importance, this lookup will be used for every packet received in a system as I am writing a firewall application (the integers are actually packet source and destination addresses). This function is used to lookup existing network sessions.</p>

<p>StdIn , StdOut and StdRandom are classes provided for the assignment whose functions have been used in the program and they work as to what their name suggests . 
So why are not the different iterators producing random outputs. <code>shuffle</code> produces a random permutation of the objects . arraycopy copies one array to another . <code>StdOut.print</code> behaves similarly to <code>System.out.print</code></p>

<p>I am trying to write a task that runs after the rest of the deploy stuff is finished that converts a scss file to css using the Sass gem.</p>

<pre><code>namespace :deploy do

  after :finished, :assets do
    on roles(:app), in: :sequence, wait: 5 do
      within release_path do
        # process sass files to css
        execute ""sass #{release_path}/styles/test.scss #{release_path}/styles/test.css""
      end
    end
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>I am using RVM on the server and have the sass gem installed in a specific gemset. There is also an .rvmrc file in the project root that loads the correct gemset when you cd into the 'current' directory that capistrano creates.</p>

<p>When I deploy, it fails on my new task saying that it cannot find sass.</p>

<pre><code>stderr: bash: sass: command not found
</code></pre>

<p>I can log into the server as the same user that is used to deploy with Capistrano and cd into the 'current' directory and run the same command in the task (substituting the #{release_path} with actual path) and it works fine.</p>

<p>Things I have tried:</p>

<ol>
<li>rewriting the execute command with the following:</li>
</ol>

<p>rvm use 2.1.5@deployer &amp;&amp; sass #{release_path}/styles/test.scss #{release_path}/styles/test.css</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>writing a bash script accessible by the deployer user that loads the gemset then runs the sass command (works when I run the new script while logged into the sever in any directory, does not work when called from the capistrano task) </p></li>
<li><p>using the capistrano-rvm plugin (adding to Gemfile, requiring in Capfile) to set the RVM gemset - hoping that it would load the gemset before running any commands.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have used Capistrano many times for deploying Rails apps and always use the asset plugin that handles precompiling and whatnot... This is the first project that I have used for deploying a PHP app and maybe the first time I have tried to manually run a capistrano task that uses a rubygem installed on the server with RVM.</p>

<p>Is it possible to run a task that depends on a specific gem/gemset... without using the default rails plugins?</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

JD</p>

<p>How can I check in my code if <code>comments</code> is a hasMany or belongsTo relationship?</p>

<p>At the moment I have worked out two solutions that work, but they feel a bit messy to me and I'm sure there must be a better way.</p>

<p>one way that works is this</p>

<pre><code>var relationship = post.get(relationshipName); // relationshipName = 'comments'

else if ( relationship.constructor.toString().indexOf('Object') !== -1 ) {

<pre><code>var relationship = post.get(relationshipName); // relationshipName = 'comments'

if (relationship.get('@each')) {
    relationshipType = 'hasMany';
}
else {
    relationshipType = 'belongsTo';
}

<p>they both work, but they both feel a bit clunky to me and I don't know how reliable they are.</p>

<pre><code>Ext.define('MyModel', {

<p>Here is some operation that I'm doing on the data for that model- </p>

<pre><code> onBeforeRender: function(component, eOpts) {
    var mystore = Ext.getStore('Mystore');

        callback: function(){
            var entity = headerStore.getAt(0);

            var currentA = entity.data.currentA;

            bs.forEach(function(record) {

                // do some other operations

<p>Now, when iterating over variable ""bs"", which is clearly an array of objects, IE 8 complains </p>

<p><strong>""Object doesn't support this property or method""</strong></p>

<p>for the forEach function. This works fine in Chrome.</p>

<p>Here is the json for the model - </p>

<pre><code>{
  ""currentA"": ""a"",
  ""currentB"": ""b"",
  ""A"": [
    {

My professor has configured the VM we are working on to execute shellcode on the stack, so I only need to place the start of shellcode into the return address. The buffer I am trying to overflow is <code>s1[64]</code>. <code>s1</code> should be a valid filename as it is used later on in the program and will cause the program to <code>exit(1)</code> if it is invalid. I am assuming that I should fill <code>s1</code> with input in this format :
<code>validFileName+fileNameTerminator+Filler+Shellcode</code>. </p>

<p><code>S1</code> is read in from the command line using <code>scanf(%s,s1)</code>. The issue I'm having is that no matter what I choose to place between my valid file name and the start of my filler and shellcode, the program thinks the whole input is the filename and fails to open it. I have tried with short file names and 63 and 64 length file names, all give the same result. 
For example: If I give the input for <code>s1</code> as <code>/./././././././././././././././././././././././testFile1GCL.txt\0AAAAAAAA\xeb\x18\x5e\x31\xc0\x88\x46\x07\x89\x76\x08\x89\x46\x0c\xb0\x0b\x8d\x1e\x8d\x4e\x08\x8d\x56\x0c\xcd\x80\xe8\xe3\xff\xff\xff\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68</code> 
I am expecting the value in <code>s1</code> to be <code>/./././././././././././././././././././././././testFile1GCL.txt</code> as it is long enough to fill the entire buffer and is followed by null terminator. The issue is that when I have <code>s1</code> printed out, it prints the whole input as if it isn't seeing the null terminator and is obviously looking outside of its given range. This then causes the program to fault because that giant thing obviously isn't a valid file name.</p>

<p>I have tried almost everything I can think of to put between the filename and the rest of my payload, including <code>\\0</code> <code>\0</code> <code>0x0</code> <code>0x90</code>. No matter what, the program always thinks <code>s1</code> is the whole long input and fails. Even if it isn't recognizing the terminator, why is it even looking outside of the 64 characters allotted to <code>s1</code>? </p>

<p>EDIT: I have now tried putting a space between the file name and rest of the payload and that keeps the file from exiting, but only because scanf stops at the space and isnt' reading in the rest of the payload</p>

<p>Sorry to ask about such a common questions, but i have been googling and reading and i still have not come right. </p>

<p>I need to make use of an array of unsigned bytes. i need to send certain characters over the network to a server and some of these characters are greater that 127. </p>

<p>I have a simplified version of the code below to try and understand the concept:</p>

<pre><code>int i= 160;
byte j = (byte) i;
System.out.println((byte)i);
System.out.println(j);
</code></pre>

<p>and this gives an output of:
<code>-96</code>
<code>-96</code></p>

<p>i need to print 160. As the server is expecting a byte of 160 and if it receives -96 it does not accept the value.
reason i used an int is that when i was reading how to get around the problem, I often came across the suggestion to just use an int, but i don't quite understand that, as i need my array to be of type byte.. </p>

<p>this is the part of my code where i send the array:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean send(byte[] data) {
    try {
     out.write(data); // Write the data to the outStream
     out.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
// TODO Auto-generated catch block
e.printStackTrace();
return false; // Return false if the TCP Transmit failed 
// }
return false;
}

You are supposed to select one of the rows of the table using checkboxs that are in the last table column and then submit them with the submit button at the bottom. The names of the info from your selected column are then supposed to be sent to another file via  method=""post"" . The problem is that $_POST is always empty. I have scoured this site and others for an answer and while I have found lots of posts about empty $_POST none of them have been able to help me. I will share a simplified version of the code I think could be relevant and bellow that I will list some of the things I have tried that have not worked.</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;form action="""" method=""post"" id=""f1""&gt;&lt;/form&gt;

    &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;

            &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=""checkbox"" value=""&lt;?= $position['symbol'] ?&gt;"" form=""f1""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;?php endforeach?&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Submit"" form=""f1""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A few notes on the above code.</p>

<p>Note 1:  The information in positions is from a MySQL table and another web site(the info from the other web site is unformatted text).</p>

<p>Note 2:  PHP code is used to create the rows of the table and fill the value in the checkbox because how many rows and what information they will contain will vary with the account.</p>

<p>Note 3:  The information should be sent to the same controller document that provided the content for this page. I used an  if  else  statement vary its actions when it receives info from the attribute  post.</p>

<p>Here is the relevant code from the controller that the information is being sent too.</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?php

        if ($_SERVER[""REQUEST_METHOD""] == ""POST"")
        {
            if (empty($_POST))
            {
                apologize(""No selection made"");
            }
            else
            {
            }

        }

    ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>At first I thought that the problem was using the php code to fill the  input  elements  value  so I tried a number of variations of the php code. However none of them worked and I found no mention anywhere that I looked of this code being bad. Also note that if I view the source page source for the  table  and  input  they show the correct value being inserted into the  input  value  in the html that is generated for the page.</p>

<p>Now being fairly confident that the PHP was not the problem I began reaserching reasons that  $_POST might be empty even though a value was passed to it from  submit. Here are some of the reasons I found.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The url in form does not match the destination but travels through some variation of a redirect during which the  $_POST  is emptied.</p></li>
<li><p>The information in  $_POST  is affected by  Jquery  somehow and is therefore formatted wrong. I don't know anything about  Jquery  so this one was kind of confusing to read through and apparently happens quit often.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a maximum amount of data that  $_POST  is allowed to transfer and someone has gone over it.</p></li>
<li><p>Someone typed  $_post  instead of  $_POST.</p></li>
<li><p>Someone has done a custom configuration of  apache  or something else and it is somehow causing the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>The information is actually coming through but is not being recognized because of formatting.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are a number of others that I have found thus far none of them seem to apply to my case. If you have any questions or want any more information about my code or what I have tried thus far let me know.</p>

<p>If anyone has a solution, thought, or even an inkling about what is going on and how to fix it let me know all help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

"21171240","1","21173807","","2014-01-16 19:37:34","","2","7988","<p>This is a follow on to my earlier question about <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21151902/puppet-stopping-service-on-individual-nodes/21153390"">parameterized classes</a>.  Following on that example a little further, I want to be able to pass running or stopped into the service, but when I add the service to a box, I don't use ""include poodle::service"", I use ""include poodle"" which does all of the other stuff Poodle requires to be installed.</p>

<p>So, can I pass the variable along to the service class like this:</p>

<pre><code># SITE.PP
node 'tweedle.example.com' {
    include basicstuff
    include poodle
}
node 'beetle.example.com' {
    include basicstuff
    class { 'poodle':
        $ensure =&gt; 'stopped'
    }
}

## POODLE MODULE, manifests/init.pp
class poodle ( $ensure = 'running' ) {
    class {'poodle::install': }
    class {'poodle::config': }
    class {'poodle::service': 
        ensure =&gt; $ensure
    }
    Class ['poodle::install'] -&gt; Class ['poodle::config'] ~&gt; Class ['poodle::service']
}

...

class poodle::service ( $ensure ) {
    service {'poodle':
        ensure     =&gt; $ensure,
        enable     =&gt; true,
        restart    =&gt; ""/etc/init.d/poodle stop &amp;&amp; sleep 5 &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/poodle start"",
        subscribe  =&gt; File['/opt/poodle/poodle.py'],
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or should I put the parameter directly on the service class and the explicitly call both the Poodle class and Poodle's service class like this:</p>

<pre><code># SITE.PP
node 'tweedle.example.com' {
    include basicstuff
    include poodle
}
node 'beetle.example.com' {
    include basicstuff
    include poodle
    class { 'poodle::service':
        $ensure =&gt; 'stopped'
    }
}

## POODLE MODULE, manifests/init.pp
class poodle {
    class {'poodle::install': }
    class {'poodle::config': }
    class {'poodle::service': 
        ensure =&gt; $ensure
    }
    Class ['poodle::install'] -&gt; Class ['poodle::config'] ~&gt; Class ['poodle::service']
}

...

class poodle::service ( $ensure = 'running') {
    service {'poodle':
        ensure     =&gt; $ensure,
        enable     =&gt; true,
        restart    =&gt; ""/etc/init.d/poodle stop &amp;&amp; sleep 5 &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/poodle start"",
        subscribe  =&gt; File['/opt/poodle/poodle.py'],
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or is adding the parameter to the service class and including ONLY that enough, because the service class has dependencies, like this:</p>

<pre><code># SITE.PP
node 'tweedle.example.com' {
    include basicstuff
    include poodle
}
node 'beetle.example.com' {
    include basicstuff
    class { 'poodle::service':
        $ensure =&gt; 'stopped'
    }
}

## POODLE MODULE, manifests/init.pp
class poodle {
    class {'poodle::install': }
    class {'poodle::config': }
    class {'poodle::service': 
        ensure =&gt; $ensure
    }
    Class ['poodle::install'] -&gt; Class ['poodle::config'] ~&gt; Class ['poodle::service']
}

...

class poodle::service ( $ensure = 'running') {
    service {'poodle':
        ensure     =&gt; $ensure,
        enable     =&gt; true,
        restart    =&gt; ""/etc/init.d/poodle stop &amp;&amp; sleep 5 &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/poodle start"",
        subscribe  =&gt; File['/opt/poodle/poodle.py'],
    }
}

            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>However, I always seem to get a <code>ArgumentOutOfRange</code> on</p>

<pre><code>if (grid.Columns[x][y].Column == grid.Columns[x][y + 1].Column)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>if (grid.Columns[x][y].Column == grid.Columns[x + 1][y].Column)
</code></pre>

<p>Before indexing these, I am performing a check as you can see to make sure that I do not get a <code>ArgumentOutOfRange</code>, but here I am. When I look at the index which is being <code>+ 1</code>, it appears to be well under the size of the collection.</p>

<p>Can anyone see the obvious mistake and where I am going horribly wrong?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I updated the code by changing the checks for X and Y to:</p>

<pre><code>if (x &lt; grid.Columns.Count - 1)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>if (y &lt; grid.Columns[x].Count - 1)
</code></pre>

<p>I still get the same error.</p>

<p><strong>FYI</strong> - The size of the collection is always the same. The size is: X = 5 and Y = 10</p>

I've been asked to put together a small prototype as proof of concept. I am using Spring Boot with Jersey as my JAX-RS implementation. In the past I've done something like this with Spring MVC.</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value = ""/dashboard"", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public DeferredResult&lt;String&gt; showDashboard(Model model) {
    DeferredResult&lt;String&gt; result = new DeferredResult&lt;&gt;();
    model.addAttribute(""testObj"", new User());
    result.setResult(""home/dashboard"");
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I tried this with Jersey and appears to work, or at least it didn't throw an error.</p>

<pre><code>    @GET
    public DeferredResult&lt;String&gt; getClients() {
        DeferredResult&lt;String&gt; deferredResult = new DeferredResult&lt;&gt;();
        deferredResult.setResult(""Nothing! But I'm Async!"");
        return deferredResult;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>However all the examples I've seen for handling operations asynchronously in Jersey look like this. </p>

<pre><code>Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
public void get(@Suspended final AsyncResponse response) {
  // This call does not block.
  client.callExternalService(
    // This callback is invoked after the external service responds.
    new Callback&lt;string&gt;() {
      public void callback(String result) {
        response.resume(""Result: "" + result + "".n"");
      }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>My main question is what is the difference between these three code snippets behind the scenes, if there even is any. Will these all accomplish the same thing?</p>

<p>Is there a better way to accomplish async? I've also seen the use of Future in Java, but never used it.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I have the following code in my Jersey Controller which is all working.</p>

<pre><code>    @GET
    public String getClients() {
        return ""Nothing, I'm Sync!"";
    }

    @GET
    @Path(""/deferred"")
    public DeferredResult&lt;String&gt; getClientsAsync() {
        DeferredResult&lt;String&gt; deferredResult = new DeferredResult&lt;&gt;();
        deferredResult.setResult(""Nothing! But I'm Async!"");
        return deferredResult;
    }

    @GET
    @Path(""/async"")
    public void getClientsJAXRSAsync(@Suspended AsyncResponse response) {
        new Thread(() -&gt; {
            response.resume(""I am Async too! But I am using @Suspended"");
        }).start();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Which goes back to my main question, what is the difference between these? My understanding is DeferredResult is a Spring thing so not sure if its appropriate to use with Jersey, although I am using Jersey + Spring.</p>

<p>My use case is as follows: My application listens for an event, and when this event occurs, it displays an alert dialog, even if the user is in the midst of using another application. From other <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2147144/android-how-to-display-a-dialog-over-a-native-screen"">questions</a> I found that the common way of doing this is to launch an activity with singleInstance launch mode. But now once this alert dialog pops up, I need to use RecognizerIntent and do some speech to text processing. However speech input dialog just does not wait for any input and onActivityResult() is called immediately. Things work fine if my alert dialog pops up from an activity which has a launch mode other than ""singleInstance"".</p>

<p>Are there other ways to approach this problem ?</p>

It's been easy to migrate except for the Apache mod_rewrite part -- which obviously wouldn't work in IIS7. I basically have no url rewriting capability, which is crucial for Cake to work. GoDaddy now offers MS URL Rewriter, but they don't offer technical support for it. I haven't seen any blog post that discusses how to do this in detail. I'd really like to avoid third-party software, especially since GoDaddy provides MS URL Rewriter, which ought to be more than sufficient.</p>

<p>The mod_rewrite directives that will allow Cake to work on GoDaddy look ridiculously easy (pasted below); can someone help me convert it to a web.config I can use with URL Rewriter? The URL Rewriter manual is really long and complicated. I'd rather not have to read the whole thing if I don't have to. Also, it would be useful know if you can get CakePHP running on GoDaddy IIS.</p>

<p>I get the feeling that this has to do with the way the egg is being built but I'm not sure. I know that python throws an error like this when an you access an attribute on what should be an object but for whatever reason is actually null. I also do not have anything with the ""module_name"" attribute or anything that tries to reference it in my own code. Running the crawler from scrapy locally works just fine but deploying the egg does not.</p>

Since most of the rear facing camera on Android are mounted in landscape mode, a need arises to rotate those images. Using the <code>postRotate(int degree)</code> method of <code>Matrix</code> class in Android in the Bitmap.createBitmap(...) method, a new bitmap is created which takes up more head space and if it is not allocated results in an OOM exception.</p>

<p>Since the specific application that I have been developing included to place overlay texts on the captured image, I had to ultimately draw the bitmap over to a canvas. Hence I decided to draw the same bitmap to the canvas instead of creating another one.</p>

<p>Following is the code that I have used in the <code>onDraw</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>Matrix mMatrix = new Matrix();
mMatrix.postRotate(90);
mMatrix.postTranslate(mBitmapFile.getHeight(),0);
canvas.drawBitmap(mBitmapFile,mMatrix,null);

<p>Can this approach be generalized to avoid rotation of the bitmap and the corresponding OOM exception in a generalized usecase also or does it have a flaw that would add further complications?</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong>
I checkout a project. That project has a folder (a module). I then update that module. This folder looks now completely changed to Git eyes. I don't want to commit those changes. Ever. I just want to have my module updated on my local copy. 
So far so good but git will always display the entire list of changes that I ve made on that folder cause it thinks I want to commit them. This means I also have to stash them everytime and I cannot do some nice stuff like <code>git add -u</code> because it will commit also this folder. In short, I d like to keep my working copy clean as it should be, just ignoring what I want to ignore.</p>

<p><strong>The first approach:</strong> <code>git ignore</code> and <code>git exclude</code> don't work with tracked files. </p>

<p><strong>The second approach:</strong> <code>git update-index --assume-unchanged</code> looks promising. But when I merge the folder from another branch this nice assumption is gone and my module updates will be overwritten by the merge. Looking the problem to the other side I eventually still have to stash them anyway which brings back to the original problem.</p>

<p><strong>Other approaches:</strong> I thought as well to <code>git rm --chached</code>. And then <code>.gitignore</code> the folder. This is still not nice because git will keep this command on stage forever and I will need to keep stashing things.</p>

<p><strong>I don't know if I am missing something or asking too much but is that difficult/impossible to get the folders that we want and truly ignore some local changes without the burden of stashing stuff at every merge and having a messy git status?</strong></p>

<p>I am sending a broadcast from my helperclass, the broadcastreceiver is implemented in an activity. I am putting an extra on the Intent at the helperclass before sending it, but the intent @ the activity has null extras. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>This is my sourcecode:</p>

       broadcast.putExtra(""msg"", _chatentryid);

    sendStickyBroadcast(broadcast);      

}
</code></pre>

<p>//Activity</p>

<pre><code>   private BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {

    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        String test = getIntent().getStringExtra(""msg"");
        Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), intent.getExtras().getString(""msg""), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();



    }
};

protected void onResume() {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(GcmIntentService.BROADCAST_ACTION_DM);
    _testintent = registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
    super.onResume();
}
</code></pre>

<p>//Manifest</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;activity
        android:name=""de.je.toctohk.activities.ChatActivity""
        android:label=""@string/title_activity_push"" &gt;

        &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;/activity&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What I already tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>normal broadcast</p></li>
<li><p>only registering the filter in the Activity</p></li>
<li><p>only registering the filter in the Manifest</p></li>
<li><p>Sticky broadcast</p></li>
<li><p>context.getIntent().getExtra…</p></li>
<li><p>intent.getExtra…</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It would be great if somebody could give me some advises.</p>

<p>My plan is to do something in <strong><code>tableView: cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code></strong>. When <strong><code>indexPath.row == 0</code></strong>, I do the description of album (i.e. the upper part), else I do the description of songs (i.e. the lower part). </p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code> - (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
static NSString *CellIdentifier = @""Cell"";
UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];

if (!cell){
    cell = [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
}

if (indexPath.row == 0 ){
    CGRect imageFrame = CGRectMake(5, 5, 69, 69);

    UIImageView *coverFram = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:imageFrame];
    NSString *imagePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""cover"" ofType:@""jpg""];
    coverFram.image = [[UIImage alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:imagePath];

    [cell.contentView addSubview:coverFram];
}else{
    NSInteger adjustedIndexPathRow = indexPath.row - 1;

    cell.textLabel.text = [self.cellRow objectAtIndex:adjustedIndexPathRow];
}

return cell;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>There are two places That I don't have simple idea to implement it:</p>

<p>Firstly, in the album page of iTunes, there is a segmented control (see the image). When I press other segment, say ""review"", the upper part remains there while the whole lower parts has been changed. </p>

<p>Secondly, I don't know how to close the gap show in the image (circle in red).</p>

<p>So, I think may be there are some other smarter(or easier) way to do it. Like, is it possible to divide the page into two part: then the do the upper part by a view; and do the lower part by a table view? (just my guess)</p>

<p>Please advice. Thank you.</p>

Can anyone recommend any resources that might be useful? Sample code is the holy grail.</p>

<p>==<strong>My mission</strong> ==</p>

<ul>
<li>I have database and more then 10k record (all float) till now and will increase on daily basis.</li>
<li>The record range is from 200-2000 (in float decimal).</li>
<li>So, I want to see the most populated region in my dataset.</li>
</ul>

<p>==<strong>What I did?</strong>==</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np

conn = MySQLdb.connect(
    host=""localhost"",
    user=""root"",
    passwd=""root"",

with conn:
    cur = conn.cursor()

    #will fetch all recoreds called monoiso field
    cur.execute(""SELECT monoiso FROM pmass_selectedion"")
    rows = cur.fetchall()

    for row in rows:

        #xvalue for monoiso variable and yvalue for range 
        xvalue = row
        yvalue = [600]

        # tried this way too but got x and y dimension error
        #yvalue = [400,800,1200,1600]

<p><strong>Ok! this plot doesnt make any sense.</strong></p>

<p>==<strong>Question</strong> ==</p>

<ul>
<li>How to make scatter plot to see the most populated region?</li>
<li>How can I assign y variable to make equal dimension with x variable(total number of fetched records)?</li>

I have an issue that after upgrading from Java 7 to Java 8 (with no other code changes) the iText XMLWorker and CSSResolver seems to output the html tables in the pdf with really thick borders.</p>

Are there new settings/libraries for iText for Java 8 that I am missing?</p>

<p>Here's ""my"" code (heavily borrowed from other posts and the internet at large):</p>

<pre><code>public class MyApp extends JFrame
{
    public MyApp()
    {
        ImageIcon myAppImage = loadIcon(""myimage.jpg"");
        if(myAppImage != null)
            setIconImage(myAppImage.getImage());
    }

    private ImageIcon loadIcon(String strPath)
    {
        URL imgURL = getResource(strPath);
        if(imgURL !- null)
            return new ImageIcon(imgURL);
        else
            return null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code fails down in <code>loadIcon</code> when making a call to the <code>getResource()</code> method. To me, there's only 2 possibilities here: (1) the <code>myImage.jpg</code> is in the wrong directory, or (2) <code>getResource()</code> doesn't like something about my image (I had to convert it from CMYK to RGB in Photoshop so I could use the same image elsewhere with <code>ImageIO</code>.)</p>

<p>I have used the <code>System.out.println(new File(""."").getAbsolutePath());</code> trick to locate the directory where the image JPG should be stored, and still nothing worked. I have subsequently placed the JPG in just about every directory inside my project, just to rule file location out as the culprit.</p>

<p>So that leaves me to believe there's something that <code>getResource()</code> doesn't like about the JPG itself. But I have now already exhausted my understanding of images and icons in the mighty, wide world of Swing.</p>

<p>My JPG loads fine in other image viewers, so that's ruled out as well. Anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

For each record from this file (which i'll call SAMPLE_FILE), i need to retrieve all records from a database (which i'll call EVENT_DATABASE ) that match key . The EVENT_DATABASE can have billions of records.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>SAMPLE_FILE
1234
2345
3456


EVENT_DATABASE
2345 - content C - 1
1234 - content A - 3
1234 - content B - 5
4567 - content D - 7
1234 - content K - 7
1234 - content J - 2
</code></pre>

<p>So the system will iterate through each record from SAMPLE_RECORD and get all EVENTS which has the same key. For example, getting 1234 and query the EVENT_DATABASE will retrieve:</p>

<pre><code>1234 - content A - 3
1234 - content B - 5
1234 - content K - 7
1234 - content J - 2
</code></pre>

<p>Then i will execute some calculations using the result set. For example, count, sum, mean </p>

<pre><code>F1 = 4 (count)
F2 = 17 (sum(3+5+7+2))
</code></pre>

<p>I will approach the problem storing the EVENT_DATABASE using HBASE. Then i will run a map-reduce job, and in the map phase i will query the HBase, get he events and execute the calculations. 
The process can be in batch. It is not necessary to be real time.</p>

<p>Does anyone suggests another architecture? Do i really need a map reduce job? Can i use another approach?</p>

<p>As well, I am adding a set amount of Labels using an array and a for loop,</p>

<pre><code>Label[] alienship = new Label[10];
for (int i=0;i&lt;alienship.length;i++)
{
    mainroot.getChildren().add(alienship[i]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is, every time I change the array of Labels size lets say from 10 to 20, the image itself shifts downwards and I would have to translate it back up to fit. </p>

<p>I have tried using both a VBox and an HBox but I am not able to see a difference in my result.</p>

<p>I have also tried to use .setFitWidth() and .setFitHeight() but nothing helped.</p>

<p>With    Label[] alienship = new Label[10];
Result: <a href=""http://puu.sh/eAihN/c5c7f38ef0.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://puu.sh/eAihN/c5c7f38ef0.jpg</a>
(In this case I would have used .setTranslate to allign it back up.</p>

<hr>

<p>With Label[] alienship = new Label[20];
Result: <a href=""http://puu.sh/eAiqz/3b4280b63b.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://puu.sh/eAiqz/3b4280b63b.jpg</a></p>

<p>What can I do to fix this issue and ensure it stays alligned no matter what size I set the array to? </p>

<p>However I need some advise on how to refresh the first view's tableview immediately after the switch is made. Any advise is appreciated.</p>

<p>EDIT: Updated requirement</p>

<p>Note: I do not want the view in the tabbar to reload everytime someone clicks on the tab. The reload should only happen in tab 1's tableview when</p>

<p>1) User is in tab 2</p>

<p>2) User clicks on 'Done button' in tab 2</p>

<p>3) App switches to tab 1 + Reloads the tableview in tab 1 </p>

<p>Rationale is that the user will update some information in tab 2 which can only be viewed in tab 1. I want the user to be able to view the updated info immediately after switching to tab 1.</p>

<p>I'm now working on power ups but for some weird reason it only shows one of the 3 different textures I designated on each power up and shows up a big version of the texture at the upper left cornor from time to time which doesn 't do anything (no collision function).</p>

<p>I'm loading the texture into the variables before entering the game loop and checked if it is actually loaded and the int values held values so that is fine. When an asteroid is destroyed a PowerUp Object is instantiated and the GLuint texture property is filled with the int value from the texture previously loaded. </p>

<p>I'll post some code fragments to display some error I might be making:</p>

//PowerUps Texture Loading  (Before the main loop and after SDL init)
int speedTexture = loadTexture(""sprites/Speed.png"");
int rateTexture = loadTexture(""sprites/Rate.png"");
int gunTexture = loadTexture(""sprites/Gun.png"");

<p>Following section is IN the main loop (when bullet vs asteroid collision occurs)</p>

fireBoost.texture = gunTexture;
push = fireBoost.Drop(powerUps_FireRate, destr[d]);

<p>And one of the PowerUp Objects to display how these function:</p>

I know similar questions have been done to death but I can't seem to find any good information on what I need to do.  I'm hoping somebody here will be able to offer some advice.</p>

<p>I need to embed DirectX into a .NET application with a modern Windows UI (toolbars, menus, ribbon if possible).  I have prototyped the DirectX part of the application in XNA for proof of concept but I do not need to stick with it, re-writing isn't a problem.  It would be nice to take advantage of the UI goodness from WPF but anything in .NET would be an option (WinForms etc).</p>

<p>The application does not do anything hugely complex:</p>

<pre><code>- It loads of a bitmap image into a texture (or a few textures as the image is often quite large)
- Renders to off screen target (applying a pixel shader based on another texture) and gets the result back as a texture
- Renders to the window with another pixel shader applied
- Pan and zoom of resulting image
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that all my research on-line discounts options but does not suggest an alternative.  For example I have read that:</p>

<pre><code>- Managed DirectX in .NET is now unsupported
- Embedded my XNA application in Winforms or WPF isn't recommended
- WPF supports pixel shaders but doesn't seem to get much love for performance
</code></pre>

<p>What is the standard for embedding DirectX into modern Windows applications (if one even exists)?  We can't be the only people wanting to do this in .NET.  </p>

<p>What would people recommend?</p>

<p>This had been working fine up until today. I'm not sure what setting I might have changed or how I could have  munged up my project. I even double checked that the correct versions of java are installed:</p>

<pre>
doug@doug-VirtualBox:~/lucid/bah-bio-demo/bahToBeh$ java -version
java version ""1.7.0_10""
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_10-b18)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.6-b04, mixed mode)
doug@doug-VirtualBox:~/lucid/bah-bio-demo/bahToBeh$ javac -version
javac 1.7.0_10
</pre>

<p>Here is JAVA_HOME</p>

<pre>
doug@doug-VirtualBox:~/lucid/bah-bio-demo/bahToBeh$ echo $JAVA_HOME
/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle
</pre>

<p>Maven <em>IS</em> using the pom.xml I think it is, if I run <code>mvn -X compile</code> I get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DEBUG]   (f) project = MavenProject: com.lucid:bahToBeh:1.0-SNAPSHOT @ /home/doug/lucid/bah-bio-demo/bahToBeh/pom.xml</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've also deleted my maven repo <code>rm -rf ~/.m2</code> and saw maven redownload everything same problem. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT -- It suddenly works mysteriously</strong>
I have no idea what happened, but suddenly now its working. I thought that one  thing I changed was I commented out a test. I went and uncommented out the test and then ran <code>mvn compile</code> and this time it compiled. Some state somewhere was out-of-sync and now things magically work?</p>

<p>I hate not knowing why my tools suddenly go wonky, so this is not an answer to the question, merely more information.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT -- and it also just suddenly STOPPED working again</strong>
Looks like fully specifying the version to compile works though, so dingding thats the winner.</p>

<p>It doesn't appear that there is a way to document formatting strings in situ like this in .NET:</p>

<pre><code>string.Format(""{0//numerator} / {1//denominator} = {2//ratio}""
              ,somevar
              ,anothervar
              ,yetanothervar);
</code></pre>

<p>In particular this is useful in localization/phraseology where the insertion points get reordered, without changing the code:</p>

<pre><code>string.Format(""Dividing {1//denominator} into {0//numerator} gives {2//ratio}""
              ,somevar
              ,anothervar
              ,yetanothervar);
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone have any tricks they use to document these to avoid mistakes when terms get rearranged in maintenance/localization etc?</p>

<p>The reason that the commenting is important is that for localization and configuration, typically, the string is not in the code with the variables - I have had them in resource files, in the app.config and in databases.</p>

<p>In an actual example, a subclassed control exposes a PhraseID property (controls are mapped to IDs in an XML file generated from the form, and the form controls are translated on the fly), so the subclassed form does something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Handle the phrases without insertion points - this is in the base class
foreach (Control in this.Controls) {
    IXLatable ixl = (IXLatable) Control;
    ixl.Text = GetPhrase(ixl.PhraseID);
}

// in the individual form classes, they override the behavior for complex displays:
lnkPublish.Text = string.Format(GetPhrase(lnkPublish.PhraseID), filename, foldername, userid);
</code></pre>

<p>Where the dictionary contains default and localized string like:</p>

<pre><code>phraseid, language code, phrase
1,en,""{0//filename} published to {1//foldername} by {2//userid}""
1,pl,""{2//userid} ublishedpay ethay ilefay {0//filename} otay {1//foldername}""
</code></pre>

<p>It is a lot less likely that a translator (who never sees the source code) will get the indexes wrong if they are provided with comments in the default phrase.  And easier for a non-localized speaker to troubleshoot problems in a translated resource.</p>

<p>but it still doesn't update the figure that are plottet, shouldn't it do this in the Foo class? Also now when I exit or quite the python script it still uses 50% of CPU power probably because the Sensor thread now runs for ever!?</p>

<p>is doing:</p>

<p>When const is present before the ""struct"", all variable instances are const, as though they'd be defined with:</p>

<p>Now, I want to provide a ""TFS Browser"" so that the user can browse what ""branch/folder"" he wants to fetch information from.</p>

<p>I am using a TreeView control and the <strong>GetItems</strong> function to get the items' path from TFS:</p>

<pre><code>private void treeView1_BeforeExpand(object sender, TreeViewCancelEventArgs e)
{
    e.Node.Nodes.RemoveAt(0);
    RecursionType recursion = RecursionType.OneLevel;
    Item[] items = null;

    // Get the latest version of the information for the items.
    ItemSet itemSet = sourceControl.GetItems(e.Node.Tag.ToString(), recursion);
    items = itemSet.Items;

    foreach (Item item in items)
    {
        if (item.ServerItem == e.Node.Tag.ToString()) //Skip self
            continue;

        string filename = Path.GetFileName(item.ServerItem);

        if (Path.GetExtension(filename) == """")
        {
            TreeNode node = new TreeNode(filename, new TreeNode[] { new TreeNode() });
            node.Tag = item.ServerItem;
            e.Node.Nodes.Add(node);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code below demonstrates that after clicking the ""expand"" button from a node, the app will ""query"" the items that are below the current ""branch"" (e).</p>

<p>However, I don't want to include files to the browser. As a quick and dirty check, I am checking if the ""path"" has an extension and if not, assume that it is a directory and show it. All was good until I discovered that we have a folder named ""v1.1"".</p>

<p>There is a solution. I can re-invoke GetItems and check its content. According to MSDN:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the path argument is a file,
  returns a set of Items that contain
  just that file. If the path is a
  folder, returns a set of Items that
  contain all items in that folder. If
  the path  contains a wildcard
  character, returns a set of Items in
  the specified folder that match the
  wildcard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, each call to GetItems take roughly a second and if a folder contains multiple files, the ""expansion"" of the node takes forever.</p>

<p>So, is there a way to just get all the ""folders"" from TFS? Or any other idea how to check if a path is a folder or a file?</p>

<p>Note that I don't care about filters supporting <code>If-Modified-Since</code> nor care about filters supporting gzipping: the static content I'm serving is forever cacheable (or its name will change) and it is already compressed data (so gzip would only slow down the transfer).</p>

<p>I don't understand exactly what is going on: is it the browser that decides to append or not cookies to the query?  If so, why would it not append the cookies to a static query on a ""cookieless"" subdomain.</p>

The view is a grid made up of a tablelayout, tablerows and textviews.  I write the view to the sdcard, then copy it to my HD using the DDMS file-explorer screen. But when I look at it in MS Paint, the image is only partially there.  </p>

<p>I have tested this two ways.</p>

<p>When I usied the xml version, the result was a small black square – no detail, no grid, nothing.  </p>

<p>Next I created a textview programmatically, with text using settext(“AAA”).  The resulting bitmap had the correct color and size, but the text was missing.</p>

<p>Would someone please tell me how to get my view correctly written to external storage so that it looks like it does on the android screen?</p>

<pre><code>//FYI.  Here are excerpts from my program:

//Test-1 used the xml version of the grid:
TableLayout tl = (TableLayout) findViewById(R.id.board);
View viewToBeConverted = tl;

//Test-2 used a simple dynamically generated view: 
TextView tv = new TextView(this);
tv.setBackgroundColor(Color.PINK);
tv.setTextColor(Color.BLACK);   
tv.setText(""AAA"");
tv.setHeight(40);
tv.setWidth(40);
View viewToBeConverted = tv;

//Both Tests used this code to write to external storage:

<p>I have an iPhone app that uses Core Data with an sqlite database. I am trying to implement a simple backup/restore of the database with Dropbox.</p>

<p>I downloaded the Dropbox SDK, and I have everything running fine as far as linking, uploading and downloading my .sqlite file.</p>

<p>However, I don't want users to have access to the actual .sqlite file for security purposes. I have been seeing JSON on these boards for some time now so I decided to look into it. I think it is exactly what I need.</p>

<p>Easier said than done. I have never worked with Java and have never implemented anything like JSON before, so I have had to try to figure out where to start.</p>

<p>I understand basically what is going on, but I'm having a heck of a time figuring out how to do it. I think I found a way to get the Core Data model into JSON format (and I do use the term 'think' loosely here). But then what - what exactly do I upload to dropbox? Do I somehow combine the model (in JSON format) and the database? What gets uploaded to Dropbox? I'm sorry if this seems obvious to most, it really is not obvious to me, and I have looked.</p>

<p>I am willing to do the work, but it just seems like I could go in 90 directions without some basic guidance and a start. I am not trying to do anything fancy as far as determining data that has been changed, etc. - just want to backup/restore the whole database. I just need some basic explanation and to be pointed in the right direction. A simple core-data sample project would be tremendous. </p>

<p>I'm not an experienced programmer, but I am a fast learner. Just break it down easy...</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.

<p>Thanks Andrew. I didn't want to 'give away' the database structure of my app, but i can now see that  the json string wouldn't be much better than the sqlite file in that area. I am a teach-myself programmer (stay at home mom) so this is all pretty new to me. Maybe I want encryption? But is that allowed for iPhone apps anyway? I recall them asking about encryption when I have uploaded binaries....  I know that iCloud is coming out soon, and I do plan to implement that as well, but with the limited amount of data that can be synced for free, I want to be able to do a simple backup as well. Many of my users have asked for it - a backup in addition to that of iTunes, which really is not a great backup since you can't restore data for just one app (you would have to restore for all apps on the iDevice). Hmmm... Any suggestions as to how to upload the file in such a way that it is not easily readable? Is encryption the way to go in this situation?</p>

I'm working on making a database for myself and a friend of mine to use. (These would be two different databases not merged at all.) I'm not starting from scratch so that might be one of my problems. I'm using my work hours sheet (Don't worry, it's just a copy) to ""learn/test"" what I want to do with VBA. Basically what I want to do is to take the information (value?) of the cells ""A3:D3"" &amp; ""E2"" and put those values into their corresponding columns. But I don't want it to over-right code inside the next cell. That's why I put in line 10 and 11. It still doesn't like it. </p>

<p>Also, I was wondering if I could get help on this...And if the information could possibly be date sensitive? i.e. You type in today's hours and remembered you forgot to log yesterday's hours so you type what the date was in the ""DateToday"" or A3 box and it logs the information in a row dedicated to that date, OR you skip two days of work and you put the date in and VBA skips two rows?</p>

<p>Are these two different requests? And are either possible? Any help is MUCH appreciated!! Thank you in advance!</p>

"28171041","1","28171378","","2015-01-27 12:54:43","","1","36","<p>In my scenario, I have a class that will do some work for me every now and then and occasionally will react with some action to it. What the action actually is will be provided from the outside. I think it's important to mention, that there will be only <em>one</em> instance from the outside telling this class what has to be done.</p>

<p>I've implemented something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class DelegatePublisher
{
    private Action&lt;byte[], int, int&gt; onCompleted;

    public DelegatePublisher(Action&lt;byte[], int, int&gt; onCompleted)
    {
        this.onCompleted = onCompleted;
    }

    public void Invoke(byte[] buffer, int index, int count)
    {
        onCompleted.Invoke(buffer, index, count);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This can be used later as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>public class Example
{
    public void Test()
    {
        var byAction = new DelegatePublisher(onDelegate);
    }

    private void onDelegate(byte[] buffer, int index, int count)
    {
        // do stuff
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once <code>Invoke</code> will be called the action will be called. (I left out all that <code>null</code> checking on purpose for the sake of this minimal example)</p>

<p>This works as expected and I am happy with that solution. However, people keep telling me that I should use <code>Events</code>. I told them that I just need a <em>single</em> <code>Action</code> to be invoked, and the code does it perfectly fine. After a long discussion, the code now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class EventPublisher
{
    public EventHandler&lt;EventPublisherEventArgs&gt; OnCompleted;

    public void Invoke(byte[] buffer, int index, int count)
    {
        var handler = OnCompleted;
        if (handler != null)
        {
            handler(this, new EventPublisherEventArgs(buffer, index, count));
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And of course the <code>EventArgs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class EventPublisherEventArgs : EventArgs
{
    public byte[] Buffer
    {
        get;
        private set;
    }

    public int Index
    {
        get;
        private set;
    }

    public int Count
    {
        get;
        private set;
    }

    public EventPublisherEventArgs(byte[] buffer, int index, int count)
    {
        Buffer = buffer;
        Index = index;
        Count = count;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My ... well, ""calling"" code now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Example
{
    public void Test()
    {
        var byEvent = new EventPublisher();
        byEvent.OnCompleted += onEvent;
    }

    private void onEvent(object sender, EventPublisherEventArgs e)
    {
        // do stuff
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there actually any benefit in doing it as an <code>Event</code>? Or the other way around: Is there something wrong with the way using an <code>Action</code>?</p>

<p>All I can tell by using <code>Events</code> is that I need more code, have an extra layer of abstraction, could potentially connect multiple (not needed) callbacks and need an extra class just to hold three parameters. The only good thing I see is that I am following a common pattern. However, I have seen lots of code with passing an action as parameter, even in the BCL, which could probably be solved with events as well.</p>
