"932843","1","934705","","2009-05-31 20:55:10","","0","198","<p>In the kiosk system I'm setting up, all Kiosks communicate with a central server to check in and receive update commands. I don't use the Dual Http communication because I can't guarantee what ports are going to be allowed at the client site, so communication is always initiated from the Kiosk (client). I currently have an Update contract which returns an enum called KioskAction which represents all of the commands that a kiosk can do (UpdateClient, SendLogFile, UpdateSetting, etc). This is working well enough, but I'm wondering if there is a more elegant way of handling this. </p>

<p>The current Update method on the Kiosk looks something like...</p>

<pre><code>var kioskAction = KioskService.Update(kioskId);
switch(kioskAction)
{
    case KioskAction.SendLogFile:
        KioskService.SendLogFile(kioskId, GetLogFile());
        break;
    case KioskAction.UpdateSettings:
        Setting[] settings = KioskService.GetKioskSettings(guid kioskId);
        UpdateSettings(settings);
        break;
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>My problem with this is that in order to add more kiosk functionality, I have to rebuild and redeploy both the kiosk application and the WCF service. What I'm considering is returning a script of some sort (probably IronPython) which actually contains the code necessary to perform the action. Then I could add new functionality just by adding a new script to the system without any changes to the Kiosk application or the Kiosk Service.</p>

<p>There are obviously some security concerns since the Kiosk Client is essentially running any code that the Kiosk Service returns, thus if the Kiosk Service is compromised, all of the Kiosks could be as well. Are there any other things I need to watch out for, or I should take into consideration before moving in this direction?</p>

<p>I have been working in this website ( www.2winbet.gr ).</p>

<p>This week added a login interface from the website that was build as a small plugin in <strong>Dart</strong> using <strong>polymer</strong>.</p>

<p>It all <em>""works""</em>, and I am pretty happy with the speed I managed to build this component in Dart... BUT.... the site became HYPER slow after I added it!!...</p>

<p>If I remove it, the site is super fast again... </p>

<p>My dart code is so small and simple... I can really not understand where the issue is... </p>

<p>Could you please point me out what have I done wrong here? I can not believe this is the best Dart can do when added as a small component to a Wordpress site that has a few animations on it.</p>

<pre><code>self.tableView.estimatedRowHeight = 44.0
self.tableView.rowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension
</code></pre>

<p>(see <a href=""http://www.appcoda.com/self-sizing-cells/"" rel=""nofollow"">appcoda</a> or <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/18746930/600169"">stack overflow</a>, using same set of constraints, eg. top/left/right/bottom for top label and left/right/bottom for bottom label). Resulting in something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/hw8li.png"" alt=""Dinamically sized cells""></p>

<p>So this works great. Now, I need to add an extra cell that has <strong>another</strong> table embedded in it. This embedded table has dynamic number of rows, should not be scrollable, but rather should resize its containing cell according to self size. But no matter what I do with constraints, I cannot get the containing cell (highlighted in red) to grow (the table Row#0, Row#1, ... has actually 10 items, but only first two are shown).</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/MdEyG.png"" alt=""Cannot force the cell to grow""></p>

<p>The idea is to have something similar to native ios maps' detail, where for example Reviews looks like an embedded dynamically sized table:</p>

We don't allow warnings in our compiler (-Werror) so I need to turn these off when compiled on certain GCC compiler versions.  (See <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3650222/best-replacement-for-gcc-ident"">Best replacement for GCC #ident</a>)</p>

<pre><code>$ echo '#ident ""FAILS on gcc-4.3.3""' &gt; test.c
$ gcc-4.4 -c test.c
test.c:1: warning: #ident is a deprecated GCC extension
</code></pre>

<p>Since these occur in several locations I want to replace them with a macro which would conditionally emit either nothing (or something that approximates <code>#ident</code>) on those ""bad"" compilers or with the actual <code>#ident</code> directive on all others.  Ideally, something like this:</p>

<pre><code># test2.c
#ifndef HAS_HASH_IDENT
#  define IDENT(x) //-- NO-OP
#else
#  define IDENT(x) #ident x
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't work because the preprocessor chokes on the <code>#</code> of <code>#ident</code>, as it is interpreted as the stringize operator when used in a macro.</p>

test2.c:4:22: error: '#' is not followed by a macro parameter

<p>I tried several macro redirection tricks, but nothing I came up with would satisfy the preprocessor.</p>

<p>Is something like this even possible?</p>

<hr>

<p>Note: The <code>#ident</code> directive is passed on intact to the compiler by the preprocessor, so the problem I'm having is <strong>not</strong> restricted by some sort of preprocessor recursion limitation.</p>

The plan is to execute the liquibase update (with some other parameters in place if necessary), before start doing the testing.</p>

<p>The caveat is, all files (including liquibase XML) that are to be submitted to UAT and PROD must have been frozen; i.e. there could be no change for any files that has successfully passed SIT. Is there any way I can do this, so that in UAT I can only execute changesets which have successfully passed SIT (and similarly, in PROD I can only execute changesets which have successfully passed UAT), without actually altering the XML file on liquibase? </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>There are several issues which are inherent inside the current development cycle:</p>

<ol>
<li>It would be redundant to ask the developers to run SIT again, this time with  context=SIT being put inside.</li>
<li>Developer(s) only wanting to test their own changesets in the UAT. So a developer is only responsible for his own changesets; meaning they don't want to run others' changesets, even if these changesets have successfully passed SIT. Same issue also applies for UAT -> PROD.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sorry I was not clear on this issue beforehand. I was tasked to implement Liquibase on my current workplace, and I don't have a really good picture of what's really happening in the cycle.</p>

<p>Parent element is fixed height, and could be scrolled vertically in case of child overflow. In that case, button should be at the end of child list, but in case there is no children, or children size don't push parent element to overflow, it should be at bottom of parent element.</p>

In f1 it is a(n,n), in f2 it's a(n*n). When I call the subroutine manually, I can do this with the same array:</p>

<pre><code>real :: a(5, 5)
call f1(a, 5)
call f2(a, 5)
</code></pre>

<p>But when I try to do this with a pointer, the compiler throws it back at me with this error:</p>

<pre><code>ptr =&gt; f2
       1
Error: Interface mismatch in procedure pointer assignment at (1): Type/rank missmatch in argument 'a'
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way around this? I was thinking about pointers, but there I have the same problem, to create it I need to know the number of dimensions. <br></p>

<p>For reference, here's the complete code (I hope it's not too long..)</p>

<pre><code>program ptrtest
implicit none

interface
    subroutine fnc(a, n)
        integer :: n
        real :: a(n, n)
    end subroutine

    subroutine f1(a, n)
        integer :: n
        real :: a(n, n)

    subroutine f2(a, n)
        integer :: n

        real :: a(n*n)
    end subroutine
end interface

procedure(fnc), pointer :: ptr =&gt; null()
real :: a(5, 5)
real :: b(4, 4)

ptr =&gt; f1

call ptr(a, 5)
write(*,*) a

!this one does not work..

!ptr =&gt; f2
!
!call ptr(b, 4)
!write(*,*) b

call f2(b, 4)
write(*,*) b
end program

subroutine f1(a, n)
integer :: n
real :: a(n, n)
integer :: i

a = 1
end subroutine

subroutine f2(a, n)
integer :: n
real :: a(n*n)

a = 2
end subroutine
</code></pre>

<p>I really hope there is a way to do this. I can't really rewrite all the subroutines so the dimensions of the array match every time :/ <br></p>

<p>My question is two-part: 1) why doesn't this work, and 2) is there any way to work around it, but still use Backbone's <code>events</code> instead of raw JQuery?</p>

<p>Think
I compiled DLL or LIB using one compiler.
They try to use above DLL or LIB in a program compiles using different compiler.</p>

<p>So how second compiler identify the functions, class, data types etc.. inside that LIB or DLL?
(I guess above two compiler having different Name Mangling)  </p>

<p>from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling"" rel=""nofollow"">wiki</a></p>

<p><code>There isn't a standard scheme by which even trivial C++ identifiers are mangled, and consequently different compiler vendors (or even different versions of the same compiler, or the same compiler on different platforms) mangle public symbols in radically different (and thus totally incompatible) ways.</code></p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>

<p>We have a web application, invoking a web service. Both are ASP.NET, currently 2.0.</p>

<p>The user logs in to the web application (Windows authentication), but to call the web service we use specific credentials:</p>

<pre><code>   proxy.PreAuthenticate = true;
   proxy.Credentials = new System.Net.NetworkCredential(UserName, Password);
</code></pre>

<p>From the invoked web service, if we access the identity attribute of the webservice class (<code>WebService.User.Identity</code>) it <strong>gets the original user logged in</strong>, not these credentials.</p>

<p>However, when switching to Federation Authentication and .NET 4 in the web service, now WebService.User.Identity retrieves the special credentials. </p>

<p>Summing up, invoking the same web method with the same credentials, WebService.User.Identity returns:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>.NET 2 + Windows authentication: original username of the logged in user</p></li>
<li><p>.NET 4 + Federation authentication: credentials used in the method call</p></li>
</ul>

<p>How can I change it to get the original user logged in in .NET 4 with federation authentication?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Some more information, in .NET 2 the server variables related to the user are:</p>

<ul>
<li>AUTH_USER: user logged in</li>
<li>LOGON_USER: special user credentials</li>
<li>REMOTE_USER: user logged in</li>
</ul>

<p>And as I said, in .NET 4 the 3 server variables are the special user credentials.</p>

The first few lines of a .js file using source maps could look like this by default:</p>

<pre><code>/*! jQuery v1.10.2 | (c) 2005, 2013 jQuery Foundation, Inc. | jquery.org/license
//@ sourceMappingURL=jquery.min.map
*/
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't have <code>jquery.min.map</code> in the same directory, a browser that supports source mapping will make a redundant http request resulting in a 404 error (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/1321878/1081234"">sounds familiar, favicon anyone?</a>).</p>

<p>I've noticed that <code>sourceMappingURL</code> could point to another domain; I'm not advocating the practice but it seems peculiar that it wouldn't be subject to CORS:</p>

<pre><code>/*! jQuery v1.10.2 | (c) 2005, 2013 jQuery Foundation, Inc. | jquery.org/license
//@ sourceMappingURL=//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.map
*/
</code></pre>

<p>Are mapped unminified sources safe? i.e. if in the example above the mapped server were compromised and malicious code added to the source, could/would it get executed? What about if you're debugging code and stepping through it? I can't find any implementation details that would answer this.</p>

"20546119","1","","","2013-12-12 14:25:48","","1","359","<p>I am learning how to use AngularJS and SignalR together and I am wondering if I can restart a SignalR connection withot losing the connectionId on the server side. The reason I am asking this has got to do with the client methods that needed to be called serverside. I haven't tried anything out yet and I just was thinking about this situation and what is the best practice solution and I am hoping some could think along or might have the solution and would like to explain it.</p>

<p>For example: I have two angularJS controllers, <code>controller1</code> and <code>controller2</code> and two signalR hubs, <code>hub1</code> and <code>hub2</code>. <code>controller1</code> is started on opening the website and in the initialisation of <code>controller1</code> I can bind a function to a client method that needs to be called in <code>hub1</code> before SignalR is started. This works fine and even after signalR is started I can still bind  functions to client methods with the <code>on</code> function even if the signalR is started, although this probably isn't nessecary because I can bind the functions to the client methods before starting the signalR connection.</p>

<p>Next, on a form I got a button and that button is starting another div which has <code>controller2</code> as <code>ng-controller</code>. In the initialisation of <code>controller2</code> I want to bind functions to client methods that needs to be called in <code>hub2</code>. But since the signalR connection is already started by <code>controller1</code>, I can't do <code>hub2.client.AMethod = function () { }</code>. I was thinking, would this be possible if I can restart a signalR connection without losing the connectionId on the server side and by doing the restart, also refresh all the client methods bindings? And if not, can I use the <code>on</code> function even if there hasn't been a function binded to client method on <code>hub2</code> before? Or do I have to bind an empty function to a client method on <code>hub2</code> as well before I start my signalR connection?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I took the time to set up a code example.</p>

<p>I got the 2 hubs: Hub1</p>

<pre><code>[HubName(""Hub1"")]
public class Hub1 : Hub
{
    public void TestMethod1(string test)
    {
        Clients.All.TestMethod1Hub1(""Testing Hub1 method1; "" + test);
    }

    public void TestMethod2(string test)
    {
        Clients.All.TestMethod2Hub1(""Testing Hub1 method2; "" + test);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and hub2:</p>

<pre><code>[HubName(""Hub2"")]
public class Hub2 : Hub
{
    public void TestMethod1(string test)
    {
        Clients.All.TestMethod1Hub2(""Testing Hub2 method1; "" + test);
    }

    public void TestMethod2(string test)
    {
        Clients.All.TestMethod2Hub2(""Testing Hub2 method2; "" + test);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I got my angularJS controller:</p>

<pre><code>testApp.controller('controller1', ['$scope', 'signalRService', function ($scope, signalRService) {
    var self = this;

    $scope.logs = [];

    self.TestMethod = function(testString) {
        $scope.logs.push({ text: testString });
        $scope.$apply();
    };

    $scope.initialize = function() {
        signalRService.connection.Hub1.client.TestMethod1Hub1 = self.TestMethod;
        //signalRService.connection.Hub2.client.TestMethod1Hub2 = self.TestMethod;
        signalRService.initialize();
    };

    $scope.addHandlers = function () {
        //this will call the client method cause it is set before the connection start.
        signalRService.connection.Hub1.server.testMethod1(""Test 1"");

        //This is working, so on function isn't required?
        signalRService.connection.Hub1.client.TestMethod2Hub1 = self.TestMethod;
        signalRService.connection.Hub1.server.testMethod2(""Test 2"");

        //So you don't need the on method (anymore?). (By the way, this is working as well ofcourse)
        signalRService.connection.Hub1.on(""TestMethod2Hub1"", self.TestMethod);
        signalRService.connection.Hub1.server.testMethod2(""Test 3"");

        //this doesn't work (obviously?) unless the line in the initalize method is uncommented
        signalRService.connection.Hub2.client.TestMethod1Hub2 = self.TestMethod;
        signalRService.connection.Hub2.server.testMethod1(""Test 4"");

        //but this doesn't work either. Same: works if line in the initialize method is uncommented
        signalRService.connection.Hub2.on(""TestMethod1Hub2"", self.TestMethod);
        signalRService.connection.Hub2.server.testMethod1(""Test 5"");

        //Also, I get the test 4 and test 5 twice, so the event handlers are added, not replaced.
    };
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>In the example, the binding to the client methods happens much later after the signalR is started (In this case, by pressing the button as example, but in a live example it could be when a user navigates to a different ng-view template and with that starts a different angular controller which also depends on client methods). In the test I see I have to add a client method (dummy or not) to every hub so I can add extra client methods later at a start up of another angular controller. I wonder if this could be done otherwise, so you don't get a long list of binding dummy functions to client methods?</p>

<p>Also, it doesn't seems to be nessecary to use the on function, binding straight away seems to work as well after the connection is started. Perhaps this is changed in SignalR version 2.0.0</p>

Of course we can't always rely on a direct database connection because sometimes cross-platform cross-language requirements will require some level of security as well...</p>

<p>CORBA was such a cool invention that seemed to have just gone nowhere?</p>

The first one maps to a known structure, so I am using the structure type in the parameter list of the webservice.  The second object may map to one of 6+ structures.  A field in the first object will tell me which structure to use for the second object once both objects are passed to the webservice.</p>

<p>I've simplified the structures for this example.  Viewing everything under debug, I am getting into the webservice fine.  aData maps out correctly.  miscData shows the name/value pairs.  I've tried DirectCast and Ctyping the object into the correct struct - both fail with an error.
Any ideas of how to get this to work under vb.net 2.0?  I know I can use a dictionary to read through the name/value pairs, but would prefer to use a structure.</p>

<p>Now I want this app to be accessible from a very simple Android application, providing basically the same functionality as my web app, just with a leaner interface.</p>

<p>The problem that I stumbled upon as a novice Android developer was that I have no idea which of the many ways to go for synchronization of the tickets.
The target of my application are Android 2.2+ based systems so there is at least AbstractSyncAdapter which wasn't clear to me how to use from the documentation.</p>

<p>Another possibility that came to my mind was simply setting up a scheduled task that would do the synchronisation at specific intervals.</p>

<p>Another problem is that I don't really understand how to use ContentProviders and how to specify custom content types (such as my ticket). Do I need these at all if I merely want to use my data from my own application?</p>

<p>What would be ideal is a reference to a decent open source project that has implemented something like this already.
Apart from that any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Further, I'm aware that there are cases where this <em>cannot</em> be ""inlined"", such as when the implementation is not ""available"" to the linker (e.g., across shared library boundaries, where separate linking occurs).</p>

<p>However, if this is code is linked into a <em>single</em> executable that does not cross DLL/shared-lib boundaries, I'd <em>expect</em> the compiler/linker vendor to <em>automatically</em> inline the function, as a simple-and-obvious optimization (benefiting both performance-and-size)?</p>

<p>So for example something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$pattern = '/слово/';
preg_replace($pattern, $replacement, $string_in_russian)
</code></pre>

<p>I tried <code>utf8_encode</code> and <code>htmlentities</code> with UTF-8 flag for $pattern, but it didn't work. Should I also encode $string_in_russian?</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Suggestion for /u flag didn't work so I'm putting the actual code I need this for. It is from a glossary plugin for Wordpress (my site is properly setup to use Russian language, and it does work, but not in this instance). So here's the code</p>

<pre><code>$glossary_title = $glossary_item-&gt;post_title;
$glossary_search = '/\b'.$glossary_title.'s*?\b(?=([^""]\*""[^""]\*"")\*[^""]*$)/iu';
$glossary_replace = '&amp;lt;a'.$timestamp.'&amp;gt;$0&amp;lt;/a'.$timestamp.'&amp;gt;';
$content_temp = preg_replace($glossary_search, $glossary_replace, $content, 1);
</code></pre>

<p>When I do a quick echo into HTML comment this is the kind of string I get for the pattern<br>
<code>/\bсловоs*?\b(?=([^""]*""[^""]<em>"")</em>[^""]*$)/iu</code></p>

<p>And well, that still doesn't seem to work. I thought maybe it was the ""s"" that was screwing me over (this level of regex is a bit beyond me but I assume it's there for possible plurals), but removing it didn't help.</p>

<p><b>Update #2:</b> Okay so I decided to do a complete ""blank slate"" test - plain PHP file with some $content strings in English and Russian and target words to replace. Here is the code</p>

<pre><code>$content_en = 'Nulla volutpat pretium nunc, ac feugiat neque lobortis vitae. In eu sapien sit amet eros tincidunt viverra. &lt;b style=""color:purple""&gt;Proin&lt;/b&gt; congue hendrerit felis, et consequat neque ultrices lobortis. &lt;b style=""color:purple""&gt;Proin&lt;/b&gt; luctus bibendum libero et molestie. Sed tristique lacus a urna semper eget feugiat lacus varius. Donec vel sodales diam. &lt;b style=""color:purple""&gt;Proin&lt;/b&gt; fringilla laoreet purus, a facilisis nisi porttitor vel. Nullam ac justo ac elit laoreet ullamcorper vel a magna. Suspendisse in arcu sapien.';
$find_en = 'proin';
$replace_with_en = '&lt;em style=""color:red""&gt;REPLACEMENT&lt;/em&gt;';
$glossary_search = '/\b'.$find_en.'s*?\b(?=([^""]*""[^""]*"")*[^""]*$)/iu';
$content_en_replaced = preg_replace($glossary_search, $replace_with_en, $content_en);

$content_ru = 'Lorem Ipsum используют потому, что тот обеспечивает более или менее стандартное заполнение шаблона, а также реальное распределение букв и пробелов в абзацах, которое не получается при простой дубликации ""Здесь &lt;b style=""color:purple""&gt;ваш&lt;/b&gt; текст..

$find_ru = 'ваш';

<p>As you can see the English text had the target word replaced, while the Russian hasn't and the code is identical and I'm using the /u flag. The file is also UTF-8 encoded. Any suggestions? (and again, I tried removing the ""s"", still nothing)</p>

<p>If you see this website, they contain just what I want, a treeview and a search index, it's using the same documentation for that tool, webdocs for DocBook.</p>

<p><a href=""http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/webhelp/docs/ch01.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/webhelp/docs/ch01.html</a></p>

<p>I have a json string as:</p>

<pre><code>[
  {
   ""widget"":""MyWidget"",
   ""description"":""A description here"",
   ""requires"":[""list"",""of"",""requeriments""],

  },
  .... more widgets
]

<p>And I need to transform that to DocBook, just the same way it was shown in the link I gave; however each time I read a page on tutorials and documentation they change everything it requires, the programs I should use, the product. So I'm quite confused.</p>

<p>Just give me a small example on what programs should I <code>sudo apt-get install</code>, and how a book from the data above should look in DocBook's format, (just an example book).</p>

<p>I've heard that DocBooks can be converted into an html, multiple-html, and chm; I want single html.</p>

<p>As you can see in the fiddle there are 2 questions but in question 1 it contains multiple text inputs while question 2 only contains one text input. Now I am trying to validate any empty text inputs but the problem is that if in the first text input in question 1 I fill in a value and leave the others empty, when I click on the submit button, as that the other text input in question 1 is empty, it should display an lert stating there is an error in question 1 stating that there is an empty text input. Well it doesn't do this instead it goes straight to displaying an alert for question 2 stating that there is a blank input in that question.</p>

<p>So it seems like my problem is that if a question has multiple inputs, if one o those inputs are filled in, then it seems to think that it is fine and that there are no empty text input errors in that question. This is obviously incorrect as every single input in a question must be filled in, not one text input can be left blank.</p>

<p>How can the fiddle be updated in order to fix this problem?</p>

<p>Jquery validation() function is here:</p>

<pre><code>  function validation() {

    var alertValidation = """";
    var _qid = """";
    var _msg = """";

    $(""[class*='q']"").each(function(i) {  
    var questions = parseInt($(""[class*=q"" + i + ""_qnum]"").text());
    var txtinput = $(""[class*=q"" + i + ""_mark]"").val(); 
    _qid = questions;
    _msg = ""You have errors on Question Number: "" + _qid + ""\n"";


if (txtinput == '') {
    alertValidation += ""\n\u2022 You have not entered in a value in all the Indivdiaul Marks textbox\n"";
}    


            if (alertValidation != """") {
                return false; //Stop the each loop 
            }

        });

I used a round about way to do this, I use Meteor.call to call a server method that then takes the buffered output from the pdf and sticks it in a collection. I use an autosubscribe to listen for a new pdf with the current user id then use a package to save the pdf to the browser. important code pieces below:</p>

<p>client/helpers.js</p>

<pre><code>Meteor.autosubscribe(function() {
PdfsCollection.find().observe({
    added: function(item){
        var blob = new Blob([item.pdf], {type: 'application/pdf'});
        console.log('new pdf found');
        saveAs(blob, 'test.pdf');
        PdfsCollection.remove({_id: item._id});
    }
});
});
</code></pre>

<p>client/templates/quotes/quotes.js:</p>

<pre><code>Template.QuotesEdit.events({
""click #pdf"" : function(event, template) {

    var html = Blaze.toHTML(Blaze.With(template.data, function() { return Template.QuotePrint; }));
    Meteor.call('createPDF', html, Meteor.userId());

}
});
</code></pre>

<p>server/pdf.js:</p>

<pre><code>Meteor.methods({
createPDF: function(html, userId) {
    var pdf = Meteor.npmRequire('html-pdf');

    pdf.create(html).toBuffer(Meteor.bindEnvironment(function(err,buffer) {
        PdfsCollection.insert({userId: userId, pdf: buffer});
    }));
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The part that is causing the error is when I actually call pdf.create. There are two errors, in the server log I get this:</p>

    fprintf (stderr, ""Unable to read RSA file %s\n"", av[1]);
    exit (1);
}

<p>the definition of RSA_verify:</p>

<pre><code>int RSA_verify(int type, const unsigned char *m, unsigned int m_len,
unsigned char *sigbuf, unsigned int siglen, RSA *rsa);
</code></pre>

<p>the definition of PEM_read_RSA_PUBKEY:</p>

        } else {

<p>I have compared the ""sig"" and ""md"" here with the value of ""sig"" and ""md"" in above C code, they are nearly the same except it's unsigned char to represent byte in C but in JAVA byte is always signed.</p>

<p>pubkey is got by follow function which is sample code i got from somewhere else.</p>

Instead I'm just drawing primitives with function calls in the game loop. Everything so far has been fine, but I'd like to know how to alter the colors of objects during runtime. </p>

<p>The basic concept is that I use a variable for the color, and when the user calls the function that changes the value of that variable, that changes the color. Simple. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>void runColor(){
  ALLEGRO_COLOR color = NULL;

   if(event.mouse.button&amp;1)
      color = al_map_rgb(255, 0, 0);
   else
      color = al_map_rgb(0, 255, 0);

   al_draw_filled_rectangle(firstXval, firstYval, secondXval, secondYval, color);
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't work. When I use similar code, the objects are simply not drawn up. There's no compilation errors, no run-time errors, no nothing. Instead, the objects have no color and are therefore invisible, though I've verified that they do in fact get created. Sooo I guess that means the color variable is somehow the right type, but does not retain the value of <code>al_map_rgb()</code> when it's set equal to whatever that function returns. I know it has to return something, because otherwise it couldn't be an argument in the <code>al_draw</code> functions.</p>

<p>While I could just write out if else if statements that lead to different draw functions, I'd rather just have a simple little bundle of code like above than a bunch of redundant stuff that solves something that should be simple. I'd just prefer not to go with the code equivalent of duct tape. </p>

<p>So I'm sure the problem probably has to do with my assumption that <code>al_map_rgb()</code> returns a value of <code>ALLEGRO_COLOR</code>, but I don't know. Would you guys be willing to make some suggestions?</p>

<p>I've only seen the example classes that have a large number of components to initialize use the private method, so it seems like it's for readability. Am I right? If that is so, wouldn't using comments also provide a similar level of readability?</p>

<p>Table profile:</p>

<pre><code>TABLE profile

2           | Y
2           | X

<p>What I'm trying to achieve is to output known_names.first_name alongside profile.last_name when profile.profile_id = known_names.profile_id. BUT I also want to print out profile.first_name and profile.last_name in one of the rows in the result. </p>

<p>So the query may look like this (syntax is wrong, and I'm looking for the correct query to do this):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT profile_id, first_name, last_name FROM profile CROSS JOIN known_names ON known_names.profile_id = profile.profile_id WHERE profile.first_name = 'David'
</code></pre>

<p>An example of the result is:</p>

<pre><code>profile_id  | first_name    | last_name
1           | David         | Battery
1           | A             | Battery

<p>Here's what I'm trying to troubleshoot: We have some legacy scripts written in Bash that run every X seconds. Upon inspection, we noticed that they consume a significant share of resources. After rewriting those scripts to Perl/Python the CPU utilization went down significantly. </p>

<p>The Bash scripts heavily use calling external programs(awk,cut,grep,sed,etc.), while Perl/Python scripts were self-contained. I would attribute it to the fact that Bash forks/execs whenever it needs to create an external call, thus we are spending time creating thousands of processes. </p>

What i presume is that when i make a virtual column, oracle forcibly asks me to keep the datatype length to 4000, therby, making it too large or heavy to populate. What should i do to make the view populate. I need to have a virtual column as email is not being entered by the application.
Help required.</p>

<p>When the service return an array of one element de json string for this array is without the
[ ]. This cause a Exception in the serializer I use. (I use this one <a href=""http://james.newtonking.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://james.newtonking.com/</a>)</p>

<p>My question is simple can I add something too tell to the deserializer to always take this section for a Array</p>

<p>In my code i have this model class</p>

<pre><code>public class Company : BaseEntity
{
    #region Constructors
    public Company()
    {

    }

    public Company(int id, string name, string description)
    {
        Id = id;
        Name = name;
        Description = description;
    }
    #endregion

    #region Properties
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public List&lt;Industry&gt; IndustryList { get; set;}
    #endregion

}
</code></pre>

<p>And the Json for a company with one industry is</p>

<pre><code>{""company"":{""description"":""Societe de Google"",""id"":""0"",""industryList"":{""id"":""0"",""name"":""Technologies Cool""},""name"":""Google Inc.""}
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe, i should change the serilizer tool too, I'm open too.
All work find with other list of 2 or more elements or if I change the List for Industry but sometime I will receive more than one industry.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>My problem is that I need to reload only the select and refreshing it when a user clicks the select itself, so new users that enter the page are added by the php query and those that changed page are removed from the list. But whit every event that I tried the jquery loops, instead of activating the reload only once every time a user clicks the form and the first click event not even reload properly the php query.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""jquery.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
$(document).ready(function() {

$(""#UserList"").load('userlist.php');

$(""#UserList"").click(function() {
    $(""#UserList"").load('userlist.php');
    evt.preventDefault();
});

});
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>For now, as a bad provisory solution, I am rebooting OS and committing but my question is :</p>

<p>Can I use the 1.7.11 version on the win7 OS in order to update and commit files that up to now were used with 1.6.16 , and will that effect the usability of the same files on the old OS should I will need to use it ?</p>

<p>Note : the files will remain on the old HD / OS .

Even worse, this control is unsigned.  To provide a more secure alternative to the people that are using browsers other than IE, or are (rightfully) unwilling to change their security settings, I am tapping into the cameras built in snap-shot script that serves up a 640x480 live JPEG image.  The plan was to update the image live on the screen every ~500ms using Javascript without having to reload the entire page.</p>

<p>I tried using the Image() object to pre-load the image and update the SRC attribute of the image element when onload fired:</p>

<pre><code>function updateCam() {
  var url = ""../snapshot.cgi?t="" + new Date().getTime();
  img = new Image();
  img.onload = function() {
    $(""#livePhoto"").attr(""src"", url);
    camTimer = setTimeout(updateCam, 500);
  }
  img.src = url;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This worked decently, but it was difficult to determine when the camera had been disabled, which I needed to do in order to degrade gracefully.  The internal snapshot script is setup to return an HTTP status code of 204 (No Content) under this circumstance, and of course there is no way for me to detect that using the Image object.  Additionally, the onload event was not 100% reliable.</p>

<p>Therefore, I am using the jQuery (version 1.2.6) <code>ajax</code> function to do a GET request on the URL, and on the <code>complete</code> callback I evaluate the status code and set the URL accordingly:</p>

<pre><code>function updateCam() {
  var url = ""../snapshot.cgi?t="" + new Date().getTime();

  $.ajax({
    type: ""GET"",
    url: url,
    timeout: 2000,
    complete: function(xhr) {
      try {
        var src = (xhr.status == 200) ? url : '../i/cam-oos.jpg';
        $(""#livePhoto"").attr(""src"", src);            
      }
      catch(e) {
        JoshError.log(e);
      }

      camTimer = setTimeout(updateCam, 500);
    }
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this works beautifully.  <strong>But only in IE!</strong>  This is the question that I would like to have answered: Why doesn't this work in Firefox or Chrome?  The <code>complete</code> event does not even fire in Firefox.  It does fire in Chrome, but only very rarely does setting the SRC actually load the image that was requested (usually it displays nothing).</p>

The custom component is clickable, and I'd like to show give the user visual feedback when they click on it by flashing orange background similar to a button.  I created the following drawable hoping to use different styles based on the internal state of the component.  Here is the drawable:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;selector xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""&gt;
   &lt;item android:state_pressed=""true"" android:drawable=""@drawable/sunshine_gradient"" /&gt;
   &lt;item android:state_focused=""true"" android:drawable=""@drawable/winter_background"" /&gt;
   &lt;item android:drawable=""@drawable/component_background"" /&gt;
&lt;/selector&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I also defined a style that references the drawable:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style name=""navigation_item"" parent=""android:Theme.Dialog""&gt;
    &lt;item name=""android:background""&gt;@drawable/navigation_item&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then assigned that to the component using:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;

&lt;merge xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
   android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
   android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
   android:padding=""5dp""
   android:orientation=""horizontal""
   android:clickable=""true""
   style=""@style/navigation_item""&gt;

&lt;ImageView android:id=""@+id/navigationIcon""
           android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
           android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
           android:layout_marginRight=""5dp""/&gt;

&lt;TextView android:id=""@+id/navigationTitle""
          android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
          android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
          android:gravity=""center_vertical""
          android:layout_weight=""1.0""
          android:singleLine=""true""
          style=""@style/favoriteTitle""
          android:layout_marginRight=""5dp""/&gt;

&lt;ImageView android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
           android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
           android:src=""@drawable/right_arrow""/&gt;
&lt;/merge&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My component code is:</p>

<pre><code>public class NavigationItem extends LinearLayout {

public NavigationItem(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
    super(context, attrs);
    setOrientation(HORIZONTAL);
    setGravity(Gravity.CENTER);
    setWeightSum(1.0f);
    setClickable(true);

    LayoutInflater.from(context).inflate(R.layout.navigation_item, this, true);

    TypedArray array = context.obtainStyledAttributes(attrs, R.styleable.NavigationItem, 0, 0 );

    String title = array.getString(R.styleable.NavigationItem_title);
    if( title == null ) title = """";
    ((TextView)findViewById(R.id.navigationTitle)).setText(title);

    Drawable icon = array.getDrawable(R.styleable.NavigationItem_icon);
    if( icon != null ) {
        ((ImageView)findViewById(R.id.navigationIcon)).setImageDrawable(icon);
    }

    array.recycle();
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>It appears the component is picking up the drawable since it does have @drawable/component_background by default.  It doesn't work when I click on it.  I don't see the state change to pressed or focus.  Can this be done on default LinearLayout?</p>

<p>I'd expect ""Ports armed"" to be printed right before the menu items ""Port 1"" and ""Port 2"" are shown. That would give my program a chance to change what ""Port 1"" and ""Port 2"" actually are.</p>

<p>For me, ""Ports armed"" is never printer (nor is ""Port 1 armed"") but the select events are fired when the items are clicked.</p>

how an application in jsf (the client), that is using ""j_security_check"" (validating user using the security realms from WebLogic), will get the user and password to make the request?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 



$r = 5; 
$s =  12;
$x= 3;  
$y= 4; 
$q= ""Hello World""; 
$c_output=`project1.exe $r $s $x $y $q`; // pass in the value to the c++ prog 
echo ""&lt;pre&gt;$c_output&lt;/pre&gt;""; //received the sum 
 //modify the value in php and output 
echo ""output from C++ programm is"" . ($c_output + 1);

?&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>This sends the variables r,s,x,y, and q to the C++ programm project1.exe and IT WORKS, but the problem is that it doesn't work for the string variable $q.</p>

<p>Here's the code that I have in my C++ programm, it's simple:</p>

<pre><code>#include&lt;iostream&gt; 
#include&lt;cstdlib&gt; 
#include&lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;
int main(int in, char* argv[]) { 
 int val[2]; 
 for(int i = 1; i &lt; in; i++) { // retrieve the value from php 
  val[i-1] = atoi(argv[i]); 
 }  
 double r = val[0];
double s = val[1];
double x = val[2];
double y = val[3];

double q = val[4]; // here's the problem, as soon as i try to define val[4] as a string or char, it screws up
 cout &lt;&lt; r;
 cout &lt;&lt;s;
cout &lt;&lt; x;
cout &lt;&lt; y;
cout &lt;&lt; q;

  // will output to php 
 return 0; 

 } 
</code></pre>

<p>It works, but for the string ""Hello world"" which i pass through $q from PHP doesn't give me the string back (i know it's defined as a double, but as soon as i try to change it to a string or a char variable the code just doesn't compile). </p>

<p>Please explain to me how i have to go around this problem so that $q can be processed as a string. FYI, I am a newbie to programming (6 months in).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>ok so after modifying the code the way you helped me, I have to read an upper triangular and a lower triangular matrix and show their product.The problem with this is that I don't store the zeroes in memory, so if I use the traditional 3-for algorithm, it will show some junk values.And if I initialize the rest of each of the matrixes with 0 it's useless to allocate the memory dynamically because I would also have the zeroes stored so I haven't done anything to improve the efficiency of the storage.I think I have to modify the code somewhere, or maybe the for intervals, but anyway I modify the program still outputs (for 3x3 matrix) 2 junk values in the upper right corner.How could I do this?</p>

<p>The problem is opencv only ssupports avi, and avi does not seem to suit a format like X264 very well.</p>

<p>Could I use Gstreamer to do this for me in C?</p>

<p>It would be good if I could choose the file format and container type too. It would be good if I could use a format like schrodinger dirac. </p>

<p>I'm new to GStreamer so I'm not quite sure if I'm on the right track here.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I've managed to capture the webcam video using </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>gst-launch-0.10 ksvideosrc ! autovideosink</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now how to transcode this to a format like H264 or dirac ...?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>gst-launch-0.10  ksvideosrc num-buffers=10 ! decodebin2 !
  ffmpegcolorspace ! x264enc ! matroskamux ! filesink
  location=video.mkv</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to create a file, but VLC player can't read it.</p>

<p><strong>The problem is:</strong> I'm using <strong>[ball.physicsBody applyImpulse:CGVectorMake(0, 100)];</strong> this calls some problems because in order to switch directions it has to counter the other force.</p>

<p>I've learned that doubling the force that going to counter the other force works. but lets say i set a variable ""ballSpeed""(<strong>doesn't exist yet</strong>) ballSpeed * 2 (for the counter force) this would work but wouldn't  the number get to high as u get farther though the game ?

<p>At first, I simply removed the ""custom.framework"" file from my project and added the new one. But nothing changed, the bug was still there.</p>

<p>After multiple tries and hours, I understood that Xcode add the old version in memory and used this one instead of the new version. I know it because in the new version I added a method and when I cmd+click the class I've add the method into, it's not there and the file's path is unavailable.</p>

<p>Searching through the web, I tried to change some version parameters to my framework projects: Compatibility version, Curent Library version, Framework version. But this didn't change anything to Xcode which keeps using the old version.</p>

<p>I also tried to make the framework's project as a sub-project and add resulting framework as a dependency to my target. It worked well, but as the framework's project is on a separated remote git repository, I don't think this is an acceptable solution.</p>

<p>So my last try was to build a ""custom2.framework"", to force Xcode to use the real file and not some cached version. But again, it doesn't work and when building I get errors telling me that all my classes in custom2.framework are duplicated symbols of its cached version of ""custom.framework"".</p>

<p>So my question is simple: how can I finally tell Xcode to deleted its cached old version and let me use the file I gave him? I already tried to delete my project's derivedData but it seems cached frameworks aren't there.... I'm so desperate :(</p>

<p>Before adding django-pipeline the management command worked well, it found everything, so it's not an issue related to finding the static files nor to directory permissions.
The Yuicompressor is installed globally and can be found under <code>/usr/local/bin/yuicompressor</code> so I didn't modify <code>PIPELINE_YUI_BINARY</code> in my settings.</p>

<p>Any clue?

At first, I am using VideoView to play the video but it is a black screen. Then I changed to using MediaPlayer to play the video on the SurfaceView and the result is same, black screen. However, after same time later, around 3 minutes ++ (some time it take more than 10 minutes), suddenly the video play correctly. I changed back to Videoview and it is same, it can play after more than 3 minutes.</p>

<p>My code on media player as below:</p>

<pre><code>    MediaPlayer mp = new MediaPlayer();

    FrameLayout layout = (FrameLayout) findViewById(R.id.framePreview1);

    mp.setAudioStreamType(AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC);
    mp.setOnErrorListener(new MediaPlayer.OnErrorListener() {

        @Override
        public boolean onError(MediaPlayer mp, int what, int extra) {
            log.error(""Error "" + what + "" "" + extra);
            return false;
        }
    });
    mp.setOnBufferingUpdateListener(new MediaPlayer.OnBufferingUpdateListener() {

        @Override
        public void onBufferingUpdate(MediaPlayer mp, int percent) {
            log.debug(""percentage--&gt;"" + percent);
        }
    });

    mp.setOnPreparedListener(new MediaPlayer.OnPreparedListener() {

        @Override
        public void onPrepared(MediaPlayer mp) {
            log.debug(""prepared!!!"");
            mp.start();
        }
    });

    mp.setOnInfoListener(new MediaPlayer.OnInfoListener() {

        @Override
        public boolean onInfo(MediaPlayer mp, int what, int extra) {
            log.info(""what "" + what + "" "" + extra);

<p>For example, consider a lookup that contains Products(codes and descriptions) which would be used in a lot of different input screens in the system.</p>

<ol>
<li>Does the viewmodel call the WCF service directly to obtain the data to fill the control?</li>
<li>Would you create a control that solely deals with Products with its own viewmodel etc and then use that in every place that needs a product lookup or would you re-implements say a combobox that repopulates the products ItemsSource in every single form view model that uses it?</li>
<li>Would I create a brand new WCF service called something like LookupData service and use that to populate my lookup lists? - <em>I am concerned I will end up with lots of lookups if I do this.</em></li>

<p>Very basically, the documentation says that I should connect to the device, set resolution, output window, frame rate and trigger mode (all, apparently successful). Then, I should open an image sequence, and either start grabbing frames, or trigger the camera at moments when I want to get a frame. This is all reasonably clear. Where things start to go wrong is in accessing the frame data. In C, the code should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Snap two images into buffers
// Buffer size is decided by image resolution
// Here assuming a image is 800*600
BeginHVDevice(1,&amp;hDevice1); //Initialize camera 1
HVSetOutputWindow(hDevice1, 0, 0, 800, 600);
//bunch of other settings as well


BYTE Buffer1[800 * 600]; // Buffer for one image
BYTE Buffer2[800 * 600]; // Buffer for a second image 
BYTE *ppBuffer[2]; //This array keeps the pointer to each buffer 
ppBuffer[0] = Buffer1;
ppBuffer[1] = Buffer2;
void *nParam
long *callBack

HVOpenSnap(hDevice1, callBack, nParam); //note that I don't use call backs so the last two params are not used 
HVSnapShot(hhv, ppBuffer, 2); //last argument is just the number of frames to collect
HVCloseSnap(hhv);
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is the buffer used to store the data. I've tried creating a string buffer of the correct size and passing that byref. I've tried creating integer buffers, long buffers. I get three results: the buffer is never touched (all null values), the program hard crashes and has to restarted (I would guess that python tries to write to an invalid address at this point), or there is a type error.</p>

<p>The current python code looks like this</p>

<pre><code>ailt_lib = WinDLL(""HVDAILT"")
util_lib = WinDLL(""HVUtil"")
raw_2_rgb_lib = WinDLL(""Raw2Rgb"")


open_snap = ailt_lib.HVOpenSnap

<p>So, I am triggering a function and inside that function, I want to be able to alter the characteristics of other buttons. For example, upon clicking my button (that I made in Interface Builder) linked to the function, I want to have a load of other buttons (also in IB) change text/color.</p>

<p>I've tried the developer book and a good amount of time on google, but I can't find the question asked or answered in the way i'm trying to phrase it (I decided this was the most clear one in the end)</p>

<p>I know I can easily edit the name of the button I've used to call the function</p>

<pre><code>[MYBUTTON setTitle:(NSString *) TITLE forState:(UIControlState) STATE];
</code></pre>

<p>but I can't figure out how on earth to edit other buttons I've added in the interface builder. Is this possible, or do I need to deal with the buttons more programmatically?</p>

<p>so far in my function, I've called the IBAction and made a load of tags to relate to the buttons that I want to change - am I heading along the right road?</p>

<p>Hope this is clear about what I'm trying to achieve, and be gentle with me, my objective C isn't that good yet!</p>

<p>So i found <a href=""http://www.advenage.com/topics/linux-timer-interrupt-frequency.php"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, it is saying that i can change the configuration via <code>/boot/config-'uname -r'</code></p>

<p>(And i also found the post saying unless it builds a tickless kernel - <code>CONFIG_NO_HZ=y</code> i couldn't change timer frequency but mine is set to <code>CONFIG_NO_HZ=y</code>)</p>

<p>And it is also mentioning how to calculate the frequency with C code.</p>

<p>So first i check for current kernel timer frequency with the C code.</p>

<p>The result is 1000~1500 Hz.</p>

<p>And i check <code>/boot/config-'uname -r'</code>, it represents like below.</p>

<pre><code># CONFIG_HZ_100 is not set
CONFIG_HZ_250=y
# CONFIG_HZ_300 is not set
# CONFIG_HZ_1000 is not set
CONFIG_HZ=250

<p>But at there timer frequency was 250 Hz...?</p>

<p>And then in order to check more, i try to modify the file to </p>

<pre><code># CONFIG_HZ_100 is not set
# CONFIG_HZ_250=y
# CONFIG_HZ_300 is not set
CONFIG_HZ_1000=y
CONFIG_HZ=1000

This is a known bug with Chrome that is supposedly being fixed, but until it is I need to find a way to make my images print correctly. I found this hack in a thread about the issue that mentions imagemagick:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I found that this was happening to grayscale jpgs. Using imagemagick I was able to mass-reprocess     images to avoid this issue using the following commands.</p>
  
  <p>if <code>identify -format ""%r"" file.jpg</code> returns ""PsuedoClass Gray"" or ""PsuedoClassGray""
  then run the following: <code>convert file.jpg -type Truecolor file.jpg</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I imagemagick.js doesn't work; I tried using it and got an error ""require is not defined"", and discovered that I cannot use node.js script in my browser. Apparently Processing.js is supposed to be a decent javascript library to mimic imagemagick, but I can't figure out how to do the same things. This is what I was trying to do with imagemagick:</p>

<pre><code>im.identify(['-format', '%wx%h', '@Model.DatabaseName' + '.jpg'], function(err, output) {
    if (err) throw err;
    // if output returns PsuedoClass Gray, do im.convert
});
</code></pre>

<p>How can I do this with Processing.js, or is there another library that I should use to do this?</p>

<p>Unfortunately we may not be able to upgrade myfaces due to time contraints.Basically I have few links on a dashboard page and its split in two sections. The first section displays all the links and second section which is underneath the first section displays the content of the link user clicks in first section. During our normal testing everything works fine and only during load testing we are seeing the exception provided in my post above whenever the user clicks on of the links (staff) in the dashboard page. Let me know if you need any more details. Thanks for all the your help.</p>

<p><strong>Main Xaml File:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;Grid&gt;
    &lt;TabControl Height=""Auto"" HorizontalAlignment=""Stretch"" Margin=""0"" Name=""tabControl1"" VerticalAlignment=""Stretch"" Width=""Auto""&gt;
        &lt;TabItem Header=""Device Control"" Name=""Connect""&gt;

                &lt;ScrollViewer Height=""Auto"" Name=""scrollViewer3"" Width=""Auto""&gt;
                    &lt;my2:VoltageView Name=""voltageView1"" /&gt;
                &lt;/ScrollViewer&gt;
            &lt;/TabItem&gt;
    &lt;/TabControl&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you notice each view ie.e <code>Connect</code>, <code>I2C</code> and <code>Voltage</code> is a user control which has a view, viewmodel and model class :) </p>

<p>Each of these views have set of textboxes in their respective xaml files. </p>

<p><strong>Connect.xaml:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;Grid&gt;
    &lt;Textbox Text=""{Binding Box}"", Name=""hello"" /&gt;
    // Some more textboxes
&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>I2c.xaml:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;Grid&gt;
    &lt;Textbox Text=""{Binding I2CBox}"", Name=""helI2c"" /&gt;
    // Some more textboxes
&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Voltage.xaml:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;Grid&gt;
    &lt;Textbox Text=""{Binding VoltBox}"", Name=""heVoltllo"" /&gt;
    // Some more textboxes
&lt;/Grid&gt;**
</code></pre>

<p>By default I have set the text of these textboxes to some value. Lets say ""12"" ""13"" ""14"" respectively in my view model classes. My main requirement is to set the text of these textboxes present in each user control to get refreshed when I change the tab.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Lets say Connect View is displayed: Value of Textbox is 12 and I edit it and change it to 16. Now I click on I2C tab and then I go back to Connect tab, I want the textbox value to get refreshed back to the initial value i.e. 12. </p>

<p>To be precise, is their a method called visibilitychanged() which I can write in all my user control classes, where I can set the value of these Ui components whenever tabs are changed?</p>

<p>Please help :)</p>

"19081531","1","","","2013-09-29 18:13:46","","1","548","<p>I have a loop in my application that loops through a set of entities in the following fashion</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var entity in mEntities)
{
    entity.Update();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some of these entities maintain a networking component that will call a Azure Mobile Service in order to update their state to the server. An example is below:</p>

<pre><code>public class TestEntity {
    public int Index;
    public int PropertyValue;

    public async void Update()
    {
        Task.Run(() =&gt; {
            MyAzureMobileServiceClient.Update(Index, PropertyValue);
        });
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The UI rendering is done by Monogame in a more traditional game loop fashion. Whilst I do not know the inner workings of it, I am fairly certain that it does not have an actual separate thread doing the work. In practice, this shows as the UI freezing every time this update is called.</p>

<p>I want to be able to run it ""smoothly"" in the background. In the old Windows model this could have easily been done by starting a new Thread that would handle it, but I don't understand the threading well enough in WinRT to understand what is wrong with my approach.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>[update] I also tried this:</p>

<pre><code>Task.Factory.StartNew(async () =&gt;
{
    while(true) {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        MyAzureMobileServiceClient.Update(Index, PropertyValue);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Every 1 seconds, I get a mini-freeze like before.</p>

<p>[update 2] I tried this with a twist. I replaced the Azure Mobile Service client call with a standard HTTP request and it worked splendidly; no mini-freezes. Granted it wasn't to the backend yet, but at least I have a work around by doing the whole thing manually. Would prefer to not do that, however.</p>

<p>[update 3] This is getting peculiar. I realize I simplified the code in this question in order to get it coherent in the context. However, this appears to have removed the true source of the problem. I tried the following things:</p>

<ol>
<li>I created a HTTP request and created the request manually, called it inside the Task.Run() and it worked splendidly with no latency.</li>
<li>I called the Azure Mobile Service client Update DIRECTLY and there was no latency.</li>
</ol>

<p>So this brings me to where the problem lies. I basically have a wrapper class for the Azure Mobile Service. The real path that goes looks roughly like this:</p>

<pre><code>CommunicationClient.UpdateAsync(myObject);

public Task UpdateAsync(MyObjectType obj)
{
    var table = mMobileServiceClient.GetTable&lt;MyObjectType&gt;();
    return table.UpdateAsync(obj);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This causes the lag, but if I do this instead of it, it works with no latency whatsoever:</p>

<pre><code>var client = CommunicationClient.MobileServiceClient;
var table = client.GetTable&lt;MyObjectType&gt;();
table.UpdateAsync(obj);
</code></pre>

<p>Soooooo... I should probably refactor the whole question. It's getting tl;dry.</p>

<p>I should be a bit more explicit: I don't want to destroy an item when I remove it from a person's cart.

        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I think, i've done wrong in my CRUD concept regarding tick/untick the tree, or i missing some steps.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Yep, i was right, the <code>null</code> value from above input hidden was the selectedTreeMenu variable was the culprit. After i comment the line which fill the selectedTreeMenu (i've updated the commented line on above snipets), now i can retrieve the data from database and the selected node  on the tree was ticked. But after i immidiatly <em>update</em> the selected tree without tick/untick the selected node, it successfully updated, but the selected node was not updated/inserted to the database / removed. So its right, that it wasnt enough just </p>

<pre><code>children.setSelected(true);
</code></pre>

<p>It seems, the selectedTree variable must be filled in too, but how to do it right? :/</p>

<p>I actually found the answer while formulating the question but I'm posting it any way since some might find this useful(as said here: <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/49922/should-i-continue-adding-a-question-if-i-have-found-the-answer-myself"">http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/49922/should-i-continue-adding-a-question-if-i-have-found-the-answer-myself</a>)</p>

<p>I'm having trouble adding size to a file field in ROR3. Here was my syntax:</p>

<pre><code>= f.file_field :file, :size =&gt; ""11""
</code></pre>

<p>this doesnt appear but creates an file input field with this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""file"" name=""soap_test_zip_file[file]"" id=""soap_test_zip_file_file""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>now I KNOW I made it work before so I looked into some old code and found this:</p>

<pre><code>= file_field_tag :file, :size =&gt; 11
</code></pre>

<p>which outputs this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""file"" size=""11"" name=""file"" id=""file""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which gives me the correct size, but the wrong file id and name. So I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""file"" size=""11"" name=""soap_test_file_file"" id=""soap_test_file_file""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which gives me the RIGHT ID, but the WRONG NAME. Question is how do I reproduce that file_field but with the size?</p>

<p>I looked into this answer by Ryan Bigg btw: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4756636/problem-showing-the-size-attribute-for-a-file-field-using-ruby-on-rails-3/4756758#4756758"">Problem showing the &#39;size&#39; attribute for a &#39;file_field&#39; using Ruby on Rails 3</a></p>

<p>and he's saying it's a cross browser thing that they render file fields differently. That is the case, but I would like to render a short file field IF the browser can handle it. </p>

"20484538","1","20484749","","2013-12-10 01:49:06","","2","291","<p>I am designing a top-down game that has a ""camera"" used to pan around the playing area. The camera can be rotated and translated; translation is typical for most top-down games.</p>

<p>To implement this I am using a class I created called ""Center."" Groups of objects are drawn around these centers (for instance, ""Car"" might extend Center, and Car has Parts ""wheel"" and ""hood."" In whatever position and orientation Car is drawn, so are wheel and hood).</p>

<hr>

<p>Things I want:</p>

<p>(1) Centers always rotate around the center of the screen. EG, a center five pixels to the left of the center of the screen that is rotated 180 degrees will end up five pixels to the right of the center of the screen.</p>

<p>(2) Centers maintain their orientation with respect to the center of the screen. So a Car ""facing"" the center of the screen continues to ""face"" the center as it is rotated, and vice versa.</p>

<p>(3) Translates up, down, left, and right always move the ""camera"" up, down, left and right. For instance, pushing the ""up"" key should move the Car up, regardless of whether the car is facing up or down. Rotating the car 180 degrees (or <em>at all</em>) should not rotate the direction of translation (for instance, making the ""up"" key translate down).</p>

<hr>

<p>I can get one, sometimes two of these at a time, but haven't been able to get all three. Here is the main chunk of code I've played with, called before the <code>draw</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>protected void setCanvas(Graphics2D g){
    at = g.getTransform();                        //Used to restore the original
    Point screenCenter = Grid.FRAME_CENTER;
                  //Grid is the abstract class maintaining all
                  //properties of the frame and game grid
    g.translate(xloc,yloc);
    g.translate(screenCenter.x+xloc,screenCenter.y+yloc);
    g.rotate(rotation);
    g.scale(scale, scale);
    g.translate(-screenCenter.x-xloc, -screenCenter.y-yloc);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know the transforms occur in ""opposite"" order so the order above <em>should</em> be correct, but I have tried every permutation possible because, you know, why not.</p>

<p>I have also tried using my <code>rotate</code> function to alter the position at the same time:</p>

<pre><code>public void addRotation(int rot){
    double pi = Math.PI;

    rotation = rotation + ((double) (rot))*pi/180;

    if(rotation &gt; 2*pi){
        rotation = rotation - 2*pi;
    }else if(rotation &lt; 0){
        rotation = rotation + 2*pi;
    }
    double hypoteneuse = Math.sqrt((double) (xloc*xloc+yloc*yloc));
    xloc = Math.cos(rotation)*hypoteneuse;
    yloc = Math.sin(rotation)*hypoteneuse;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To no avail. Note that the input is in degrees and Center stores the current rotation in radians, which are required by the <code>Math</code> and transform functions. All variables stored by Center are doubles -- using ints led to some (occasionally hilarious) rounding errors over a lot of rotations.</p>

<p>For the record, here are my <code>translate</code> and <code>rotate</code> functions:</p>

<pre><code>public void translate(int dx, int dy){
    xloc = xloc + dx;
    yloc = yloc + dy;
}

public void addRotation(int rot){
    rotation = rotation + ((double) (rot))*Math.PI/180;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously <code>xloc</code> and `yloc are the x and y location of the object on the screen, and the translate function always works properly when there is no rotation.</p>

<hr>

<p>On another note (I can probably figure this out if I can figure out the above, but may as well), it doesn't want to preserve the shape of the triangle -- after rotating, the x and y distance from the center of the screen are always the same.</p>

<p>Halp?</p>

if(m.contains(""milk"")) { return true; }
</code></pre>

<p>But I figured this is still N^2 (i.e. for loop inside of for loop, as the number of rows added to mainList like row3['item1', 'item2', 'item3'], the iteration increments in N^2)</p>

<p>how can I optimize this without N^2 ?</p>

<p>I defined the needed ember-data models and everything seems to work fine, but I am not quite sure, if I am going in the right direction - so this is going to be a ""Is that solution alright?""-question.</p>

<p>Our service API provides a method to get records limited to a requested time frame - the REST request parameters simply look like this:</p>

<pre><code>{ from: ..., to: ... }
</code></pre>

<p>The user of my UI should be able to select a time frame and the UI should update with the data within the requested time frame.</p>

<p>There will be no write operations for now - this is a read-only UI.</p>

<p><strong>Here is my current solution:</strong></p>

<p>I defined a route class which provides the model for the request result and an ArrayController which serves the UI.</p>

<p>Route Class Code:</p>

<pre><code>MyModelRoute = Ember.Route.extend
    model: -&gt;
        # Calling controller to get the required parameters for the initial
        # model setup - this doesn't feel right too, but I want to keep the
        # time frame parameters for the JSON request at one position (controller)...
        controller = @controllerFor('my_models')
        # get fromDate and toDate from controller
        MyModel.find({from: fromDate, to: toDate})
</code></pre>

<p>ArrayController Code:</p>

<pre><code>MyModelController = Ember.ArrayController.extend
    updateMyModels: -&gt; 
        # ... some boring code to get fromDate and toDate ...

        # Overwriting the content property which was previously set by
        # route's model property seems to be nasty...
        myModels = MyModel.find({from: fromDate, to: toDate})
        myModels.one('didLoad', =&gt;
            @set('content', myModels) 
        )
</code></pre>

<p>My view provides two date pickers, allowing the user to specify which time frame she wants to see (<code>fromDate</code> and <code>toDate</code> in my sample code).</p>

<p>Whenever the user selects a new time frame, two observed variables on my controller are updated which will cause a new request to the server with the user requested time frame (<code>updateMyModels()</code> method in my sample).</p>

<p><strong>So, here is my point:</strong> As you can see, I am currently updating the 'content' property of my ArrayController within the controller's <code>updateMyModels()</code> method which is bound to the UI timeframe properties - I am totally ignoring the previously provided route's model. So the model property on my route just exists to ""initialize"" my controller which seems to be a bit odd...</p>

<p>Everything works fine, but I am wondering if there is a better / right way to do that?</p>

<p>If I should use the model provided by the route instead of a controller property:
Is there a way to communicate with the route's model from the controller (I am sure there is a way ;-) ), and more important: how can I reload the current route from my controller? Is the <code>transitionTo()</code> method the right way?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>So instead, during my app's initialization, I am pre-creating a series of AVAudioPlayers so that each one is basically pre-loaded with one of my 16 sounds, so they're ready to be played at any time.</p>

<p>The problem is, to keep this clean, I would like to store the references for these 16 AVAudioPlayers in an NSMutableArray, so I can easily get at them just by knowing their array location.  However, the way I'm doing it is crashing the simulator w/no error messages in the log:</p>

<p>Here is how I'm currently setting up the array of AVAudioPlayer references:</p>

<pre><code>// (soundPlayers is an NSMutableArray instance var)
soundPlayers = [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:(NSUInteger)16];                                       

for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++ ) {
    NSString *soundName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""sound-%d"", i];
    NSString *soundPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:soundName ofType:@""mp3""];
    NSURL *soundFile = [[NSURL alloc] initFileURLWithPath:soundPath];   
    AVAudioPlayer *p = [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:soundFile error:nil];
    [soundFile release];
    [p prepareToPlay];
    [soundPlayers addObject:(id)p];
    [p release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then later I try to load, say, sound #8 and play it back:</p>

<pre><code>// (soundPlayer is an AVAudioPlayer instance var)
self.soundPlayer = [soundPlayers objectAtIndex:(NSUInteger)8];
[soundPlayer play]; 
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas?  Also does anyone know if any of the slick debugging tools that come with XCode would be useful for this type of problem?</p>

"2648869","1","2648911","","2010-04-15 20:48:13","","4","764","<p>Perhaps I'm misapplying Unity, but here goes.  I have a couple of applications, both of which load the same plugin assemblies.  All assemblies require a library, and I want them to be able to access this library via Unity.  However, in order to use Unity, or any other IoC framework, I'd have to write an interface for this library.  I will probably do this, but since an interface isn't really needed for anything other than to support Unity, I am afraid that this means that I am 1) missing the point, or 2) misapplying the framework.  If I avoid something that offers me DI, then I'd have to make the library class a singleton, and then pass it to all of the plugin constructors, or via a public property, and I don't want to do this.</p>

<p>That said, and without actually implementing anything with Unity yet, I'm not getting one other detail -- although Unity will let me request the library via Resolve&lt;>, my plugins will still need to have a reference to the Unity instance that is created in the main applications.  So is this a case where your only option is to pass the Unity reference to all of the plugins, but then it's convenient from that point on, merely because you can use Unity to get at all of the other dependencies?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I realized that I missed the point, but hopefully someone can clarify for me -- I shouldn't be passing a ref to Unity everywhere!  I should only have to create the container in my app, and then register all of the types afterward.  Then when I instantiate all of my plugins, they should just magically be able to use those registered interfaces, with almost no extra effort, right?  In my case, my constructors must be parameterless because my plugin loader can't deal with arguments, and in that case, I'll have to use property injection to give them access to the interfaces, right?</p>

<p><strong>ANOTHER UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I went ahead and tried out Unity.  I registered the instance of my class that's needed by all plugins.  I also know that I would eventually run into a problem with my plugin loader since they are parameterless (and I might need to pass it a ref to Unity to make them work).  However, just for now I am directly creating a plugin, and I am doing that via the Resolve method.  So here's basically what the code looks like:</p>

<pre><code>// app code
ICandySettings _candy_settings = new CandySettings();
IUnityContainer unity = new UnityContainer().RegisterInstance&lt;ICandySettings&gt;( _candy_settings);
CandyPlugin _plugin = unity.Resolve&lt;Candy&gt;(); // throws null reference exception, see below.

// plugin code
public class Candy
{
  [Dependency]
  ICandySettings CandySettings { get; set; }

  ...

  public Candy()
  {
    CandySettings.GetSetting(""box""); // CandySettings is null!  why?  Didn't Unity do this for me?
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So my problem right now is that I would expect (given my limited knowledge), that Unity is going to automagically set the plugin's CandySettings reference to whatever instance was registered via RegisterInstance, but it's not.</p>

<p><strong>A WORKING OPTION</strong></p>

<p>If I skip the smoke and mirrors stuff and just pass my UnityContainer into the plugin's constructor, then I can call Unity.Resolve() to set the value of my CandySettings property, and everything works great.  I'd love to know why the [Dependency] attribute isn't doing what I thought it would.  If I'm not mistaken, I actually shouldn't need to pass Unity to each constructor in my plugin loader.  I should just use Unity.Resolve() and it would presumably work if [Dependency] is working.  However, now I understand what everyone is saying about how picking an IoC container will then force it on your entire development team.</p>

<p><strong>MEF!</strong></p>

<p>So far, MEF is winning the battle for me.  It's pretty simple, and the magical smoke and mirrors stuff works great for my needs (currently).  But I'd still like to get Unity working.  I find it strange that for MEF, I only need to compose the parts and everything else just falls into place, whereas I can't seem to get Unity to just inject stuff automatically, and I have to Resolve everything through a reference to Unity passed everywhere.  This can't be right.</p>

<p><strong>More MEF</strong></p>

<p>I like the idea that I can resolve multiple objects with MEF very easily, but what about cases where I'm using the Strategy pattern to dictate code behavior?  Currently, it's as simple as changing the reference from one implementation of a behavior to another, and it <em>just works</em>.  Does anyone do this with MEF?  Is the right way to do it to use ImportMany, and then use extra code to determine which behavior in the list should get invoked?</p>

There he gives an example of consequences of lazy evaluation, in the part with <code>add/adders</code> functions. Let me quote that bit: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This [lazy evaluation] is important when creating closures with lapply or a loop:</p>

<pre><code>add &lt;- function(x) {
  function(y) x + y
}
adders &lt;- lapply(1:10, add)
adders[[1]](10)
adders[[10]](10)
</code></pre>
  
  <p>x is lazily evaluated the first time that you call one of the adder
  functions. At this point, the loop is complete and the final value of
  x is 10. Therefore all of the adder functions will add 10 on to their
  input, probably not what you wanted! Manually forcing evaluation fixes
  the problem:</p>

<pre><code>add &lt;- function(x) {
  force(x)
  function(y) x + y
}
adders2 &lt;- lapply(1:10, add)
adders2[[1]](10)
adders2[[10]](10)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not seem to understand that bit, and the explanation there is minimal. Could someone please elaborate that particular example, and explain what happens there. I am specifically puzzled by the sentence ""at this point, the loop is complete and the final value of x is 10"". What loop? What final value, where? Must be something simple I am missing, but I just dont' see it. Thanks a lot in advance. </p>

By XML configuration file, I mean XML files used at run-time, ie web.xml, and not the POM itself. I could of course maintain a separate XML file for each environment and then define a Maven property that contains the different file path and then have separate Maven profiles that point to the correct file path for the profile to correctly package them into the WAR/EAR/etc based upon environment, but I would prefer a different solution.</p>

<p>Like I am suggesting in the title, the differences are not something that can be accomplished by a simple token replacement - completely different XML structures are required in different environments. I originally tried using the maven Antrun plugin to run Ant's xmltask to add/remove/delete nodes via Xpath, but this is overly verbose and complicated to maintain, especially considering this plugin's inability to properly handle XML namespaces in a non-verbose manner. </p>

<p>Ideally, the XML file would like a normal template file, ie:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;x:if environment=""production""&gt;
     &lt;a b=""c""&gt;
       &lt;d&gt;

&lt;/x:if&gt;
&lt;x:else&gt;
     &lt;g /&gt;
&lt;/x:else&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>At build time, ie during package or process-resources phases, the resultant XML file would contain only one set of XML or the other (in this example).</p>

<p>Note how, like I mentioned above, the node structures are completely different between environments. </p>

<p>So let's say I have a rectangle of 80 wide and 120 in length(these are random guesses, and need to be able to change) what would be the formula I need to use to determine the largest circle I can create in this rectangle and when I say circle let me be more specific I do not want a oval I want a full circle. </p>

<p>So this question is simply what would be the proper formula needed for this. Thank you for your time =) </p>

<p>EDIT 1:
realised that i wasnt calling writeClose() on test atthe start and that i could not call onDestroy with the listActivity, so i created a buffer activity that does the check test.isEmpty(), now works again for just cases of shop, </p>

<p>think there is a problem in the code of Location in the oncreate or with this</p>

<pre><code>        Location test = new Location(this);

<p>On touch screen devices there is obviously no ""hover"" state as the user either touches, or not, the initial button and if that button is, itself, a link to another page then it just jumps to that page and the user doesn't get to see the child menu.</p>

<p>Is there an easy fix to this?  I would like, ideally, on touch screen devices for the initial touch to display the drop down menu and, from there, for a second touch to trigger the link.</p>

<p>Would appreciate any advice that is offered.  Thank you.

however the solution posted there did not work and I think it may actually be different.</p>

<p>I am trying to fit a curve to data using scipy.curve_fit, when I leave all 3 parameters free everything works correctly and I get the expected result.</p>

<pre><code>def func(x,a,b,c):
  return a*np.exp(b*(x**c))

<p>However when I try to fix one of the values (c=2) as below,</p>

  return a*np.exp(b*(x**2))

popt, pcov = curve_fit(func2,x,y)
</code></pre>

<p>I get <code>TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'int' and 'list'</code> using <code>numpy.power(x,2)</code> as suggested in the linked question allows the code to run but produces the wrong result. Anyone see what I'm doing wrong?</p>

<p>Edited to add:
Even more confusingly leastsq, which as far I know is used by curve_fit, with the 2nd formula works.</p>

<p>2nd Edit:
To those to mentioned the list problems X and Y are now both arrays and the code runs without error. However func2 still produces drastically the wrong result. (I would post the graph here but apparently I need more rep.)</p>

<p>Func 1 curvefit gives <code>[a,b,c] =  [ 1.71890826, -0.0239123,   3.17039851]</code> however for func2 it all goes wrong <code>[a,b] = [ -2.88694423e-15,   9.99999998e-01]</code>. I don't understand how such a small change can be causing such a drastic problem, leastsq was able to fit this data with c=2.</p>

<p><strong>Everything works fine If i start the tomcat server and hit the service through a browser but when i run the jersey tests application context doesn't load.</strong> 
When I run tomcat it looks for application context in Project-1's src/main/resources/ and loads the beans
Project-1 applicationContext.xml refers xmls from Project-2 src/main/resources/ which use property files in project-2.</p>

<p>When i copy the contents of Project-1 src/main/resources into Project-1 src/test/resources and do the same for Project-2.This problem is fixed.
Now i get Error creating bean with name 'emf'

<p>-----------------Got the Solution -------------------</p>

<p>you need to include HelperModule to test Module .. 
after fix code for test/helpers/sessions_helper_test.rb will look like </p>

<pre><code>require 'test_helper'

  include SessionsHelper # This line is added to  code.

<p>Likewise <code>isConditionSatisfied(some_input_string, pattern_2)</code> should return me true if either of the following conditions is satisfied - (a) the input string has both the words <code>birds</code> and <code>fly</code> or (b) the input string has both the words <code>athlete</code> and <code>run</code>.</p>

<p>My question is - are there any libraries in C# that would enable to write my function <code>isConditionSatisfied(....)</code> most efficiently, without me needing to break up the ""condition_strings"" into tokens and then checking for AND/OR conditions in the input string. I have been exploring <code>string.contains()</code> and <code>Regex.IsMatch()</code> but I am not sure if either of them has the support to do this kind of a AND/OR checks in an input string.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to write the function <code>isConditionSatisfied</code> in the most efficient manner in C# and if there are any existing libraries that may make my life easier for this kind of a problem ?</p>

<p>In addition, 'on-shift' can be of state:</p>

<pre><code>'available', 'busy' or 'inactive'

<p>What is the best way to  model these states in my rails app? </p>

<p>Is it to:</p>

<p>a. create two state attributes:</p>

<pre><code> 1. object_state - can take the value: 'scheduled', 'on-shift' or 'past'
 2. on_shift_state - can take the value: 'available', 'busy' or 'inactive'

<p>b. create a single state attribute, which can take the value:</p>

<pre><code> 'scheduled', 'past', 'available', 'busy' or 'inactive'.

<p>c. some other way.</p>

<p>I think option b would ensure logical consistency in the database, but increase the complexity of queries, e.g. if I want to search for units which are  'on-shift', I need to search for 3 different states. It may also be harder to extend, e.g. if I want to add more states at a later date.</p>

<p>If I were to go with option b, is there some way to simplify the queries?</p>

<p>Any specific structures/methods you would suggest using?</p>

<p>The server returns the definition, as expected, along with several headers (that I do not need). The response looks something like this:</p>

<p>I was wondering if:</p>

<p>a) Is there a way to specify to curl (or an option in the dict protocol) to not return all that extra information (i.e. <code>250 ok [d/m/c = 3/0/162; 0.000r...]</code>)</p>

<p>b) You probably noticed that the dict response returns information that is not displayed in the most user friendly way. I was wondering if anybody knew of any existing php library that will allow me to display this in a nicer way. Otherwise I'd have to code my own.</p>

<p>c) If this is not the way most dictionary websites retrieve their definitions, how do they do it? In my understanding the most comprehensive dictionary database is the one at dict.org (which supports the <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2229"" rel=""nofollow"">dict protocol</a> and is where I am sending my cURL request).</p>

"21976409","1","21976545","","2014-02-23 23:52:11","","0","55","<p>I was given the assignment to make a simple paint program in java that utilizes a GUI and has basic I/O capabilities. That was all I was told to do by my professor. However, I've only made one GUI program before, so jumping straight into this paint program has been a headache. Now I'm nearly done, but the program isn't really behaving as I expected. When new objects are drawn on the Panel, they draw invisible white rectangles on the objects underneath them that erases those objects. I think this is the result of the repaint(xMin, yMin, xMax - xMin + 1, yMax - yMin + 1); method in DrawShapes, but can't think of a way to fix it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the objects are also not saving properly. I can get it to export a jpg as I intended, however, it will only export the last image drawn and not everything on the paintComponent canvas.</p>

<p>Lastly, the clear method in DrawShapes is working in a very similar way. When the clear method is activated, it will clear everything but the last image drawn.</p>

<p>Is there anyone more familiar than me with these tools that can see a way to fix these? This is only the first program I've utilized draw on, and I/O.</p>

<p>Here is the class for the panel that the shapes are supposed to drawn on:</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>    public class Aviation implements FlightStruct, FlightSystem extends Vehicles {
    ...var decoration...
    ...override method definitions...

    public controls aviation(Flight request, Flight destination, Flight target) {

    FlightResponse flightResponse = new FlightResponse();

    flightResponse.speed = target.speed;
    angularVel.calculate(greatCircle.flightResponse.speed);
    _readVelData();
    if (vel.circular.velocity &lt;= 10000) {
    for(countryName : country) {
    calculateArrivalTime();
    _readFuel();
    if(fuel.limit &lt; pwi.percent*100) {
           createShortPathLandingPoint(Path newDestination, Register checkPoint);
       }
    }
}
    private eqiptment company(String name, Vendor vendor) {
    ....calculate equiptment stuff that calls bunch of private methods
    }

 ...alot more method here
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I was wondering how should I go about to unit test these kind of code?
I have attempted to stubb data but the inner method is too complicated to walk through. Usually one method calls down multiple layers of sub methods.
For example....
the fuel class calls _readfuel and in _readfuel it calls destinationCheckPoint, flightWayPoint, flightSpeedCalc...then in each of those sub method it calls its own sub method. (ex. flightWaypoint calls calculateWayPoint, angVelocity, speedLimit, ....)
Overall I do not think this is doable by stubbing the data because finding the right data is difficult.
Then My second option was to use Mockito to mock the method / classes. Which sounds more reasonable to do, but again I encounter where there are multiple sub method which are private...and mockito cannot mock the private method. I then attempted to use PowerMockito to mock the private method it work for a few thousand lines and there was something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (!report.successful &amp;&amp; !telCList.isEmpty()) {
...
report.wayPoint = update.assignWayPoint(wayPointList); //null point exception
...
</code></pre>

<p>where the update was null and few hundred lines above it was declared</p>

<pre><code> UpdateGateWay update = setDestinationWayPoint(distance, speed, altitude);
</code></pre>

<p>setDestinationWayPoint is a private method and I use powerMockito to mock the behavior I have also returned the value as part of the stub. but when it get called below it become null.</p>

<p>I pretty much give up at this point. I was wondering if there would be more reasonable way to do this type of testing....</p>

<p>I modified project in folder CORTEX_M4F_STM32F407ZG-SK of FreeRTOS Demo projects(removing the existing tasks and creating my own). Here is the main function:</p>

<pre><code>int main(void) {
    int ret;
    prvSetupHardware();
    DebugPrintf(""FreeRTOS v7.3.0 starting\n"");
    ret = xTaskCreate(SampleTask0, (signed char *) ""T0"", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE, NULL, 2, NULL);
    if (ret == pdTRUE) {
        DebugPrintf(""Task %x creared successfully:%d.\n"", SampleTask0, ret);
    } else {
        DebugPrintf(""Task 0 created failed.\n"");
    }
    ret = xTaskCreate(SampleTask1, (signed char *) ""T1"", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE, NULL, 1, NULL);
    if (ret == pdTRUE) {
        DebugPrintf(""Task %x creared successfully:%d.\n"", SampleTask1, ret);
    } else {
        DebugPrintf(""Task 1 created failed.\n"");
    }
    DebugPrintf(""Starting scheduler...\n"");
    vTaskStartScheduler();
    for (;;);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have configured configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE as 4096 in FreeRTOSConfig.h and the code goes well as Task Scheduler started and invoked my SampleTask0 function. Here is the task code:</p>

<pre><code>void SampleTask0(void *pvParameters) {
    (void) pvParameters;
    uint16_t delay;
    for (;;) {
        delay = 10000;
        DebugPrintf(""Task 0 running\n"");
        while(delay) {delay--;}
    }
    vTaskDelete(NULL);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Task 1 function is almost the same as Task 0 except it prints different information.
These code compile and after I write the binary to my board, the SampleTask0 does not work as expected. The DebugPrintf function which sends character through USART3 only prints ""Tas"" and then everything halts. I traced the code with gdb and execute the code by step, ""Task 0 running"" got printed but when it returned to task function(before ""while(delay) {delay--;}"") an error occurred:</p>

<p>Cannot access memory at address 0xa5a5a5a5</p>

<p>SampleTask0 (pvParameters=0x0) at main.c...</p>

<p>According to FreeRTOS <a href=""http://www.freertos.org/FAQMem.html#StackSize"" rel=""nofollow"">documents</a>, the stack of each task is filled with 0xa5 bytes upon creation. I think there may be something wrong with stack. I have set configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW to 2 to enable stack overflow detection, but my hook function had not been invoked when this happened.</p>

<p>The startup_stm32f4xx.s in CORTEX_M4F_STM32F407ZG-SK was created for EWARM toolchain and I replaced it with the startup file in STM32F4-Discovery_FW_V1.1.0 which I downloaded from ST website. So it could potentially corrupt the stack, but I'm not sure about this. Anyone have ideas about this?</p>

<p>I created a class that implements IDataReader to read from .DAT, so I can pass the reader into  the SqlCeBulkCopy.WriteToServer method. The reader mostly seems to be fine, but I'm having problems with nulls; an exception is thrown when a null has been read from the .DAT file and is being inserted into a nullable column in the destination table.</p>

<p>I'm tempted to believe I have implemented the IDataReader interface wrong in some way. I have the values stored in an array of System.Object, and the method IsDBNull is implemented in this way:</p>

<pre><code>public bool IsDBNull(int i)
{
   return Values[i] == null;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's worth noting that I've put a breakpoint here and the method is not being called.</p>

<p>Otherwise, my relevant methods are:</p>

<pre><code>    public object GetValue(int i)
        {
            return Values[i] ?? DBNull.Value;

                return GetValue(GetOrdinal(name));
            }
        }

<p>Here my partition key is the treeid and the unique key is the personid. i am trying to insert records into this table from a .net application using the datastax .net driver. I have about 200K records to insert and the performance degrades (goes beyond 200ms/op) as the number of inserted records increases. From the Opscenter i see that the Par New garbage collection time increases (goes beyond 20 ms)as the records are being inserted.</p>

<p>Now if i change the table with the different primary key like PRIMARY KEY (personid, treeid) and do the same inserts, the performance is much better (below 1 ms/op) and the garbage collection time is well under 1 ms</p>

<p>Well, why is the partition key makes difference in the performance here? I have other tables with the treeid,personid as the primary key but with out any map data types and they perform very well. 
I want to perform the query based on the treeid and how should i be able to do it? should i take the maps into different tables? or create a secondary index on the treeid column? whats more efficient for reading? </p>

Once this file is imported, an alias-String is returned for subsequent reference. So far, so good.</p>

<p>However, what I want to do is receive someone's public key, store it, get back an alias, store that alias somewhere (e.g. contacts data) and use it to retrieve back the public key when the user wants to encrypt a message to that person. Is that possible? I have very little experience with Public-key cryptography and have the feeling that I have misunderstood the whole purpose of the KeyChain API.</p>

<p>I used the <code>dendrapply()</code> function and a local function to color leaves, which is working fine.</p>

<p>I have results from a statistical test that indicate if a set of nodes (<em>e.g.</em> the cluster of ""<code>_+v\_stat5a\_01_</code>"" and ""<code>_+v\_stat5b\_01_</code>"" in the lower-right corner of the tree) are significant or important.</p>

<p>I also have a local function that I can use with <code>dendrapply()</code> that finds the exact node in my dendrogram which contains significant leaves.</p>

<p>I would like to either (following the example):</p>

<ol>
<li>Color the edges that join ""<code>_+v\_stat5a\_01_</code>"" and ""<code>_+v\_stat5b\_01_</code>""; or,</li>
<li>Draw a <code>rect()</code> around ""<code>_+v\_stat5a\_01_</code>"" and ""<code>_+v\_stat5b\_01_</code>""</li>
</ol>

<p>I have the following local function (the details of the ""nodes-in-leafList-match-nodes-in-clusterList"" condition aren't important, but that it highlights significant nodes):</p>

<pre><code>markSignificantClusters &lt;&lt;- function (n) {
  if (!is.leaf(n)) {
     a &lt;- attributes(n)
     leafList &lt;- unlist(dendrapply(n, listLabels))
     for (clusterIndex in 1:length(significantClustersList[[1]])) {
       clusterList &lt;- unlist(significantClustersList[[1]][clusterIndex])
       if (nodes-in-leafList-match-nodes-in-clusterList) {
          # I now have a node ""n"" that contains significant leaves, and
          # I'd like to use a dendrapply() call to another local function
          # which colors the edges that run down to the leaves; or, draw
          # a rect() around the leaves
       }
     }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>From within this <code>if</code> block, I have tried calling <code>dendrapply(n, markEdges)</code>, but this did not work:</p>

<pre><code>markEdges &lt;&lt;- function (n) {
  a &lt;- attributes(n)
  attr(n, ""edgePar"") &lt;- c(a$edgePar, list(lty=3, col=""red""))
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my ideal example, the edges connecting ""<code>_+v\_stat5a\_01_</code>"" and ""<code>_+v\_stat5b\_01_</code>"" would be dashed and of a red color.</p>

<p>I have also tried using <code>rect.hclust()</code> within this <code>if</code> block:</p>

<pre><code>ma &lt;- match(leafList, orderedLabels)  
rect.hclust(scoreClusterObj, h = a$height, x = c(min(ma), max(ma)), border = 2)
</code></pre>

<p>But the result does not work with horizontal dendrograms (<em>i.e.</em> dendrograms with horizontal labels). <a href=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3331/3410126060%5Ff8f06c4498%5Fo.png"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is an example</a> (note the red stripe in the lower-right corner). Something is not correct about the dimensions of what <code>rect.hclust()</code> generates, and I don't know how it works, to be able to write my own version.</p>

<p>I appreciate any advice for getting <code>edgePar</code> or <code>rect.hclust()</code> to work properly, or to be able to write my own <code>rect.hclust()</code> equivalent.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Since asking this question, I used <code>getAnywhere(rect.hclust())</code> to get the functional code that calculates parameters and draws the <code>rect</code> object. I wrote a custom version of this function to handle horizontal and vertical leaves, and call it with <code>dendrapply()</code>.</p>

<p>However, there is some kind of clipping effect that removes part of the <code>rect</code>. For horizontal leaves (leaves that are drawn on the right side of the tree), the rightmost edge of the <code>rect</code> either disappears or is thinner than the border width of the other three sides of the <code>rect</code>. For vertical leaves (leaves that are drawn on the bottom of the tree), the bottommost edge of the <code>rect</code> suffers the same display problem.</p>

<p>What I had done as a means of marking significant clusters is to reduce the width of the <code>rect</code> such that I render a vertical red stripe between the tips of the cluster edges and the (horizontal) leaf labels. </p>

<p>This eliminates the clipping issue, but introduces another problem, in that the space between the cluster edge tips and the leaf labels is only six or so pixels wide, which I don't have much control over. This limits the width of the vertical stripe. </p>

<p>The worse problem is that the <code>x</code>-coordinate that marks where the vertical stripe can fit between the two elements will change based on the width of the larger tree (<code>par[""usr""]</code>), which in turn depends on how the tree hierarchy ends up being structured.</p>

<p>I wrote a ""correction"" or, better termed, a hack to adjust this <code>x</code> value and the <code>rect</code> width for horizontal trees. It doesn't always work consistently, but for the trees I am making, it seems to keep from getting too close to (or overlapping) edges and labels.</p>

<p>Ultimately, a better fix would be to find out how to draw the <code>rect</code> so that there is no clipping. Or a consistent way to calculate the specific <code>x</code> position in between tree edges and labels for any given tree, so as to center and size the stripe properly.</p>

<p>I would also be very interested in a method for annotating edges with colors or line styles.</p>

When a user downloads a photo I track this on the photo's <code>full_downloads</code> and <code>presentation_downloads</code> attribute.</p>

<p>That's all good.</p>

<p>Sometimes I want to know how many total downloads there have been. I have a simple method, <code>total_downloads</code> which looks like so:</p>

<pre><code>def total_downloads
  self.full_downloads + self.presentation_downloads
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> I would like to be able to order photos by all three of these (full, presentation, total downloads). The first two are easy, but how do you do an order by the sum of two columns? Note this needs to be both SQLite and PG compatible at minimum.</p>

<p>A side question, would it be faster to make the <code>total_downloads</code> method a query, and if so what's the best way to write that? I know to sum on the class you can call <code>Photo.sum(...)</code>, but I'm not sure how to do that for two columns on a single record.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

The problem is that even though the face detection works using <code>haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml</code>, i am receiving no results for eye detection using <code>haarcascade_eye_tree_eyeglasses.xml</code> (or any other haarcascade for eye detection). Following the code, i noticed a few errors that would not allow my code to run, so i modified to tutorials source. 
From this:</p>

<pre><code>if( !face_cascade.load( face_cascade_name ) ){ printf(""--(!)Error loading\n""); return -1; };
 if( !eyes_cascade.load( eyes_cascade_name ) ){ printf(""--(!)Error loading\n""); return -1;};
</code></pre>

<p>To this: </p>

<pre><code> eyes_cascade.load( eyes_cascade_name );
 face_cascade.load( face_cascade_name ) ;
</code></pre>

<p>This was the only modification made in the source. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> </p>

<p>->all of the haarcascades are in the source directory.</p>

<p>->only some of the haarcascades provide results <code>haarcascade_frontalface_alt</code> &amp; <code>haarcascade_profile</code> </p>

<p>-> I have tried the other available haarcascades for eye detection including <code>haarcascade_eye_tree_eyeglasses.xml,</code> <code>haarcascade_eye haarcascade_righteye_2splits.xml</code>, <code>haarcascade_mcs_righteye.xml</code>, <code>haarcascade_mcs_lefteye.xml</code> <code>haarcascade_mcs_eyepair_small.xml</code>, <code>haarcascade_mcs_eyepair_small.xml</code>, <code>haarcascade_mcs_eyepair_big.xml</code>, <code>haarcascade_lefteye_2splits.xml</code></p>

<p>If anybody has a solution to my problem that would be greatly appreciated! The source is available through the Opencv documentation <a href=""http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/objdetect/cascade_classifier/cascade_classifier.html"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>here</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
I still have no answer to this, but I'm pretty sure that it is because of the updates to version of a module, why? because I have exactly the same project but with a different Package.json and when I do ""npm insatll"" then run that one, I get a warning from mongoose, saying that "" This is an UNSTABLE release of Mongoose"" but it runs and I don't get that error message! It connects to my mongodb while the latest version gives that error. Will be happy to have some help from you to understand it.</p>

It is saying it is OK to use to store login information but not OK to store registration keys for licensing software. I don't understand that. Login is more important than registration keys. </p>

<p>It's saying that other applications can read that information. Does that mean my application can read sensitive data from other applications simply because the user is logged in?

<p>In 1.asp , I have html form like below</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""2.asp"" method=""post""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So submitting the form goes to 2.asp as per the above code where I access the form request attributes in 2.asp   </p>

<p>Now , I want 3.asp as a  frame  with 2.asp data as well.Basically Whenever a user clicks 1.asp form 
I want a page divided into two equal parts (i.e frames) with 2.asp and 3.asp</p>

<p>So I edited 1.asp file as</p>

<pre><code> &lt;form action=""customize.asp"" method=""post""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In customize.asp , I wrote Html frames like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;frameset cols=""50%,50%""&gt;
  &lt;frame src=""2.asp""&gt;
  &lt;frame src=""3.asp""&gt;
&lt;/frameset&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now , The real problem here is  whenever a user submits 1.asp form , the I am getting a page with two frames. 2.asp and 3.asp . Here 3.asp is looking fine. But 2.asp is not able to take  the html form attributes. <strong>How to submit a form to one of the multiple  frames  in some html file?</strong></p>

<pre><code>__kernel
void myfunc(__global char *buf_pw,
__global char *buf_hash)
{
    int idx = get_global_id(0); 
    int a = 1 + 1;

    if (idx == 0 )
    {
        buf_pw[0] = 'A';
        buf_pw[1] = 'e'; 
        buf_pw[2] = 'l';
        buf_pw[3] = 'l';
        buf_pw[4] = 'o';
        buf_pw[5] = 0;
    }
    if (idx == 0)
    {
        while(buf_pw[0] != 'A');
        printf(""%c\n"", buf_pw[0]);
        printf(""%c\n"", buf_pw[1]); 
        printf(""%c\n"", buf_pw[2]);
        printf(""%c\n"", buf_pw[3]); 
        printf(""%c\n"", buf_pw[4]);

        printf(""%s\n"", buf_pw);
        printf(""%s\n"", wololol);  
    }
    printf(""Hello World\n"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Running the program multiple times can produce different results. Most of the time, it produces output that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>A
e
l
l 
o

(null)
wololol
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
</code></pre>

<p>with the other case being:</p>

<pre><code>A
e
l
l 
o

Aello
wololol
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
</code></pre>

<p>I expected the second case to be the correct output, but it rarely occurs. What's causing the weirdness with how writing/reading pw behaves?</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php"">list of supported timezones</a> from PHP manual, I can see all valid TZ identifiers in PHP.</p>

<p>My first question is how to get that list from code but that's not what I really need.</p>

<p>My final goal is to write function <code>isValidTimezoneId()</code> that returns <strong>TRUE</strong> if timezone is valid, otherwise it should return <strong>FALSE</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>function isValidTimezoneId($timezoneId) {
  # ...function body...
  return ?; # TRUE or FALSE
  }
</code></pre>

<p>So, when I pass TZ identifier using <code>$timezoneId</code> (string) in function I need boolean result.</p>

<p>Well, what I have so far...</p>

<h2>1) Solution using @ operator</h2>

<p>First solution I've got is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function isValidTimezoneId($timezoneId) {
  $savedZone = date_default_timezone_get(); # save current zone
  $res = $savedZone == $timezoneId; # it's TRUE if param matches current zone
  if (!$res) { # 0r...
    @date_default_timezone_set($timezoneId); # try to set new timezone
    $res = date_default_timezone_get() == $timezoneId; # it's true if new timezone set matches param string.
    }
  date_default_timezone_set($savedZone); # restore back old timezone
  return $res; # set result
  }
</code></pre>

<p>That works perfectly, but I want another solution (to avoid trying to set wrong timezone)</p>

<h2>2) Solution using <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.timezone-identifiers-list.php"">timezone_identifiers_list()</a></h2>

<p>Then, I was trying to get list of valid timezone identifiers and check it against parameter using <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.in-array.php"">in_array()</a> function. So I've tried to use <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.timezone-identifiers-list.php"">timezone_identifiers_list()</a>, but that was not so good because a lot of timezones was missing in array returned by this function (alias of <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/datetimezone.listidentifiers.php"">DateTimeZone::listIdentifiers()</a>). At first sight that was exactly what I was looking for.</p>

<pre><code>function isValidTimezoneId($timezoneId) {
  $zoneList = timezone_identifiers_list(); # list of (all) valid timezones
  return in_array($timezoneId, $zoneList); # set result
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This code looks nice and easy but than I've found that <code>$zoneList</code> array contains ~400 elements. According to my calculations it should return 550+ elements. 150+ elements are missing... So that's not good enough as solution for my problem.</p>

<h2>3) Solution based on <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/datetimezone.listabbreviations.php"">DateTimeZone::listAbbreviations()</a></h2>

<p>This is last step on my way trying to find perfect solution. Using array returned by this method I can extract <strong>all</strong> timezone identifiers supported by PHP.</p>

<pre><code>function createTZlist() {
  $tza = DateTimeZone::listAbbreviations();
  $tzlist = array();
  foreach ($tza as $zone)
    foreach ($zone as $item) 
      if (is_string($item['timezone_id']) &amp;&amp; $item['timezone_id'] != '')
        $tzlist[] = $item['timezone_id'];
  $tzlist = array_unique($tzlist);
  asort($tzlist);
  return array_values($tzlist);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This function returns 563 elements (in <code>Example #2</code> I've got <strong>just 407</strong>).</p>

<p>I've tried to find differences between those two arrays:</p>

<pre><code>$a1 = timezone_identifiers_list();
$a2 = createTZlist();

print_r(array_values(array_diff($a2, $a1)));
</code></pre>

<p>Result is:</p>

<p>This list contains all valid TZ identifiers that <code>Example #2</code> failed to match.</p>

<p>There's four TZ identifiers more (part of <code>$a1</code>):</p>

<pre><code>print_r(array_values(array_diff($a1, $a2)));
</code></pre>

<p>Output</p>

<p>So now, I have almost perfect solution...</p>

<pre><code>function isValidTimezoneId($timezoneId) {
  $zoneList = createTZlist(); # list of all valid timezones (last 4 are not included)
  return in_array($timezoneId, $zoneList); # set result
  }

<p>That's my solution and I can use it. Of course, I use this function as part of class so I don't need to generate <code>$zoneList</code> on every methods call.</p>

<h2>What I really need here?</h2>

<p>I'm wondering, is there any easier (quicker) solution to get list of all valid timezone identifiers as array (I want to avoid extracting that list from <code>DateTimeZone::listAbbreviations()</code> if that's possible)? Or if you know another way how to check <strong>is timezone parameter valid</strong>, please let me know (I repeat, <code>@</code> operator can't be part of solution).</p>

<p><hr>
P.S. If you need more details and examples, let me know. I guess you don't.</p>

<p>I'm using <code>PHP 5.3.5</code> (think that's not important).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Any part of code that throws exception on invalid timezone string (hidden using <code>@</code> or caught using <code>try..catch</code> block) is not solution I'm looking for.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h2>Another update</h2>

<p><strong>I've put small bounty on this question!</strong></p>

<p>Now I'm looking for the easiest way how to extract list of <strong>all</strong> timezone identifiers in PHP array.</p>

<p>The mappings here between the pk columns work fine. The problems come when I attempt to add another entity which is a link table to the <code>Action</code> entity. This link table also has an <code>@EmbeddedId</code>.</p>

    @ManyToOne private User user;


}

<pre><code>@AssociationOverrides({

<p>I guess I can do:</p>

    string exceptionMsg;

<p>But I would really like to keep the code outside of the try block to a minimum, if at all. Which comes to my second question: is there a way I can assign <code>getStringMsg(id)</code> to <code>msg</code> inside of the <code>try</code> block, yet still have access to it in the <code>catch</code> block?</p>

<p>for example, i have 2 part of code. the first is a worker object that read and write some files. 
but the worker don't actually know the real path of these files, so i have created a wrapper for redirect the open to the good filepath.</p>

<p>the probleme is that i create a wraper for every task ( with its own files) for the worker.
i can't pass the wrapper for every function during the work. 
the best way to permit the working function to open through the wrapper is to set it global, but i am working with thread and i can't actually set it global (mutliple task with mutiple wrapper can be set up at the same time)</p>

<p>what i want is to do some thing like this:</p>

<pre><code>with init_current_wrapper(task) as wrapper: #  do_some_magic_for_set_it_global(wrapper)

    do_some_jobs_for_this(task) # all process inside can access THIS wrapper
</code></pre>

<p>and inside the process under ""do_some_jobs_for_this()"" i could do</p>

<pre><code>wrapper = get_current_wrapper()
wrapper.open(""fakefilename"")
#blablabla

<p>without thread , a simple OSWrapper.get_current() could do it,  but with thread,i can't know what is the ""good"" wrapper with the current context.</p>

<p>Overall, im trying to have multi chat rooms with one server while being able to save one's conversation chat log and be able to read it back</p>

<p>The current code i have works only as 1 general chat room
Server Side:</p>

<pre><code>static void Main(string[] args)

<p>What is a good way to use flood fill with the Graphicsmagick command line or its pgmagick wrapper for python?</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>So far this is what I have, but its saying that the signatures do not match:</p>

Code:

<pre><code>from pgmagick import Image, ColorRGB

img = Image('C:\\test.png')
cRGB = ColorRGB(256.0, 256.0, 256.0)
geo = Geometry(1,1)
img.floodFillColor(geo, cRGB, cRGB)
</code></pre>

Error:

<pre>
  File ""C:/Dropbox/COC/automate/coc_automate/python/__init__.py"", line 62, in take_main_screen_shot
    img.floodFillColor(geo, cRGB, cRGB)
Boost.Python.ArgumentError: Python argument types in

    floodFillColor(class Magick::Image {lvalue}, class Magick::Geometry, class Magick::Color)
</pre>

<h3>Extra</h3>

<p>Also, if you know of a better way that I can manipulate graphics from a Python application or the windows command line, I'm all ears. I'm starting to feel like I may be using the wrong tool for this with the state of the documentation.</p>

<p>I am ""manually"" setting a dropdown box in a form, yet the 'webbrowser' doesn't seem to update.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.hgtv.com/hgtv-urban-oasis-2011-giveaway-enter/package/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's an example</a></p>

<p>If you notice in the form, it has a place where it asks you to fill in a state. (I.e., california, etc). It looks like a javascript/DHTML popup box in MSIE (firefox doesn't do the same, so you need to use MSIE, since that is what the webbrowser control relies on). If I 'click' on the ""state"" field, a popup box appears. I then can say select ""CA"" for california, and it updates it. (It now says ""CA"").</p>

<p>If I <em>progrmatically</em> do it, I would do something like:</p>

<pre><code>WebBrowser1.forms(2).elements(13).value = ""CA"" ' (sets it to 'california')
WebBrowser1.forms(2).elements(13).item(9).selected = true (makes sure it is 'selected')
</code></pre>

<p>However -- within the webbrowser control -- it <em>still</em> appears as if nothing has changed. (In reality it has, i.e., if I submit the form it will submit the correct info), but it just doesn't ""update"" it.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea how I can do a ""forced"" refresh (either progrmatically or through some javascript/dhtml refresh), that will correctly then 'update' the field to show that ""CA"" has been selected?</p>

<p>Thanks very much!</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM leads.BatchDetails T1
INNER JOIN leads.BatchHeader h ON T1.LeadBatchHeaderId = h.ID
WHERE 
 T1.LeadBatchHeaderId = 34  
  AND (T1.TypeRC = 'R' OR h.DefaultTypeRC = 'R')    
 AND EXISTS (SELECT ID FROM leads.BatchDetails T2 where 
            T1.FirstName = T2.FirstName AND

            T1.Zip5 = T2.Zip5 AND

            AND (T2.TypeRC = 'R' OR h.DefaultTypeRC = 'R' )
     )
</code></pre>

<p>It runs decently fast in 2 seconds. When formatting the code I accidently added an additional <code>SPACE</code> between <code>AND</code> + <code>EXISTS</code> so the query look like this.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM leads.BatchDetails T1
INNER JOIN leads.BatchHeader h ON T1.LeadBatchHeaderId = h.ID
WHERE 
 T1.LeadBatchHeaderId = 34  
  AND (T1.TypeRC = 'R' OR h.DefaultTypeRC = 'R')    
 AND  EXISTS (SELECT ID FROM leads.BatchDetails T2 where 
            T1.FirstName = T2.FirstName AND 
            T1.LastName = T2.LastName AND 
            T1.Address1 = T2.Address1 AND
            T1.City = T2.City AND                     
            T1.[State] = T2.[State] AND                     
            T1.Zip5 = T2.Zip5 AND                     
            T1.LeadBatchHeaderId = T2.LeadBatchHeaderId 
            and t2.ID &lt; t1.ID
            AND (T2.TypeRC = 'R' OR h.DefaultTypeRC = 'R' )
     )
</code></pre>

<p>All of a sudden the query takes 13 seconds to execute.
I am running SQL Server in an isolated sandbox environment and I have even tested it on a different sandbox. I also checked the executed query in profiler, the reads are virtually the same, but CPU time is way up</p>

<p>If this is not weird enough, it's getting weirder. When I change <code>SELECT * FROM</code> to <code>SELECT Field1, ... FROM</code> at the top of the query the execution takes over 3 minutes.</p>

<p>I have been working with SQL Server for 10 years and never seen anything like this. </p>

<p>Edit:
After following the suggestions below it appears that queries are ""white-space-sensitive"". However I still have no idea why the <code>SELECT * FROM</code> is so much faster than <code>SELECT Field1, ... FROM</code></p>

<p>Basically, I was quite disappointed by the results as the speedup was only marginal compared to serial computation on the CPU (less than x2) and if I made Aparapi use the CPU (which it does parallelized) the CPU was even faster.  <br/>
During execution, the graphic card is under full load so I think there should be no communication issues.</p>

<p>My hardware config.:  <br/>
i7 2670QM <br/>
AMD 7610M <br/>
16GB RAM <br/></p>

<p>Since I'm completely new to GPGPUs I don't know what to expect. <br/>
1. Is it likely that my setup is somehow screwed? If so, where should I look? <br/>
2. Or am I simply expecting too much from an entry level graphic card? If so, how do different models of graphic cards scale with this kind of problem? What are the specs that I have to look for if I wanted to get hardware that is faster?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Ok, so I just reran the program with a 10x10 matrix. <br/>
Unsurprisingly, the CPU needed less than 1ms. <br/>
However, the GPU needs more than 1600, so there is definitely something wrong with either Aparapi or openCL or my hardware (drivers should be up to date). Anyone an idea where I should look?</p>

<p>Basically at the moment all the checker does is see if data is in the correct format, i.e. double is a double, int is int, etc... And if it isn't I'm throwing an exception.</p>

<p>Like so:</p>

<pre><code>private static string CheckDouble(string doublevar)
        {
            double tryParseDoubleResult;
            var tryParseDouble = double.TryParse(doublevar, out tryParseDoubleResult);

            if (tryParseDouble)
            {
                return doublevar;
            }

            throw new Exception(""Invalid data found. Cannot open."");
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Which would be great. Except for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>I built this in Win 7 Environment in VS 2008.</li>
<li>I've tested in Win7/ XP</li>
<li>When running in Win7 - the exception does not throw. I can even see that it should have, as I display the data it loads into a listbox in the app, but after loading the list is blank. If I step through the code line by line to the item where there is bad data, I can see the exception throw. But not in Debug if not debugging line by line, and not in Release either.</li>
<li>In XP the exception throws as expected.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is obviously a problem having the application run in a state where there is problem with the data but no indication to user and it should not have let the user get this far IF there was a problem with the data.</p>

<p>Why isn't the exception throwing in Win7?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>edit:</strong></p>

<p>I think maybe the exception is being swallowed as I only see it thrown when stepping through line by line. What is the best way to check if it is being swallowed? Just follow my apps execution and look for a Try block? (It still doesn't exactly make sense when it throws properly in XP already, however...)</p>

<p>As a bit of extra, I have a start up window with 3 buttons. One is Open button. From here I open the data file to process.</p>

<pre><code>var w = new Window1();
w.Show();
</code></pre>

<p>//At this point, FormLoad of all tabitems inside window1 execute, where the exception SHOULD throw. And in fact when it happens, nothing is thrown but the execution jumps from the line where the exception should throw to the line below Close(); and the next window loads but one screen out of three is empty because of the exception thrown because of the data.</p>

<pre><code>Close();
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>edit1:</strong></p>

<p>The class where the exception is thrown is Singleton, I don't know if this has anything to do with the problem...</p>

<p><strong>edit2:</strong></p>

<p>After several days further investigation, I'm still at a lost to why this is happening. Addressing the questions: yes I know I should make my own custom exception class. But this doesn't change what is happening here. I cannot find a try catch higher up the stack. I have an exception handler where if an exception is thrown in the application, it <code>Environment.Exit(1);</code> then logs the exception to text file. I have taken the exception handler out completely and yet still see the same behaviour.</p>

<p>It is not due to regional settings problem...</p>

<p>And anyway, all aside, this still does not explain why the exception is thrown as intended in XP (and the app crashes and logs exception to file) whereas in Win7 - the exception is ignored and execution continues.</p>

<p>The most strange point is that the problem occurs on a random unpredictable stage when working with an MS Access form that contains our iGrid control. After you open the form next time in design view or form view, you see a blank control container for the iGrid ActiveX and you get the ""There is no object in this control"" error message. As a result of this problem, you may also get</p>

<p>Run-time error '97':
Can not call friend function on object which is not an instance of defining class.</p>

<p>It looks like the form becomes corrupted after some actions of the developer.</p>

<p>This problem has never occurred in other development environments including Visual Basic 6 or even UserForms in Ms Word/Excel VBA, but from time to time this happens in MS Access. Sometimes even MS Access freezes when you open the problem form, and you need to terminate the process thru CTRL+ALT+DEL.</p>

<p>We tried to find a sequence of actions which can lead to the problem for sure, but we have not managed to do that. The only thing which may accompany the appearance of this problem is the following. If you refers a non-existing form control in your code, and you encounter this error while debugging your form (most likely, the compiler option ""Compile On Demand"" should be set for that), the form became corrupted when you hit the ""Reset"" button on the toolbar in the VBA environment.</p>

<p>If you even do not know how to overcome this problem, but at least know how to repair the problem form - write your recipe, please. Maybe, there is also a tool to repair this automatically.</p>

<p>We cannot reproduce the problem in a brand new form from scratch, but we have a problem mdb file. You can download it from the following source (though you might need to install iGrid ActiveX also):</p>

<p><a href=""http://10Tec.com/FSTemp/iGrid_MDB_NoObj_Prob.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://10Tec.com/FSTemp/iGrid_MDB_NoObj_Prob.zip</a></p>

<p>Sure, this is not a problem of an unregistered ActiveX control. The problem occurs when the control is properly registered in the Windows registry.</p>

The DB includes several tables, among them an <code>Activity</code> table, having a channelId field, a <code>Channel</code> table having a userId field, and a <code>User</code> table having a userName field.
The function <code>getAllProjectACtivities(user,project)</code> returns a promise of an array of <code>Activity</code> objects, each including all <code>Activity</code> table fields.
The function <code>findChannel(channelId)</code> returns a promise of a single <code>Channel</code> object, including all <code>Channel</code> table fields.
The function <code>findUser(userId)</code> returns a promise of a single <code>User</code> object, including all <code>User</code> table fields.
All 3 functions hide a JSON Ajax request to the DB, and have been tested to work properly standalone.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do here is get a list of activities, for each of them get the channel, for each of the channels get the user.
Then I build a table of activites comprising of 2 activity fields and one user field.</p>

<p>For this I need a 3 phase DB access yielding arrays of objects. Below is the code:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){    
    var projNum=1;
    var userNum=1;
    var globalActivityList; //this global array will store data from the beginning of the promise chain to be used at the end of the chain

    var table = $('#tableContainer').children();

            globalActivityList=activityList;
            return Promise.all(activityList.map(function(activity){
                //alert(activity.activityChannelId);//******** shows the right stuff
                findChannel(activity.activityChannelId);
            }));
        })
        .then(function (channelList){
            alert (channelList.length);//******* gives the right size
            alert (channelList);//******** u-oh, this shows ,,,,,,,,,,,, - the array is empty.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Problem
            return Promise.all(channelList.map(function(channel){
                findUser(channel.channelEmployeeId);
            }));
        })
        .then(function(userList){
            for (var i=0; i&lt;userList.length; i++){
                var tableString=""&lt;tr&gt;"";

Coming from the embedded system world, I’m interested in ROMable structs in order to save RAM.</p>

<p>Here’s the deal:</p>

<p>I have many different structs like</p>

<pre><code>struct  struct_1
{
    uint8_t     const   variable1;
    uint16_t    const   variable2;
};
</code></pre>

<p>In a struct template I store a pointer to a C-array holding struct elements and the size of that C-array, as follows.</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;
struct config_data
{
    T    const  * const  ptr_to_c_array;
    uint8_t       const  arraySize;
};

template &lt;typename T, uint8_t array_size &gt;
constexpr uint8_t  getArraySize ( T  (&amp;)[ array_size ] )    
{
    return array_size;
};

int main(){

struct_1                  const  array_1[]      =  { {2,5},{1,9},{20,20} };
uint8_t                   const  arraySize_1    =  getArraySize( array_1 );
config_data &lt;struct_1&gt;    const  config_data_1  =  { array_1, arraySize_1 };

}
</code></pre>

<p>Here’s my question:</p>

<p>How can I have a struct template that infers the size of my c-array automatically, without giving it the size explicitly by using sizeof[array] / sizeof(array [0]) or the getArraySize template?</p>

<p>I’d like to have something like:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt; typename T, uint8_t  array_size &gt;
struct config_data_new
{
    T    const  * const ptr_to_c_array;
    uint8_t       const arraySize = array_size;    //clearly, does not work   
};

int main(){

struct_1                     const  config_array_1[] =  { {2,5}, {1,9}, {20,20} };
config_data_new &lt;struct_1&gt;   const  config_file_new  =  { config_array_1 };           

uint8_t   const size  =  config_file_new.arraySize;

}
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to infer the array size in a template config_data _new similar to the template getArraySize?</p>

<p>I am trying to create my own CMS for MVC and would like to use MEF as part of my plugin framework.  </p>

<p>Just need to know how to programmatically install, uninstall, turn on, and turn off the plugins that are made for MEF.</p>

<p>Thinking of writing  ""Plugins"" to use MEF and then package that into Nuget where it can be installed and uninstalled from the Admin setting page.</p>

<p>Nuget would be responsible for Installing and Uninstalling</p>

<p>MEF would be responsible for registering the plugin, and some how have options to turn it on and off.</p>

<p>Example Situation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>User install CMS</p></li>
<li><p>User goes to Admin Section --> Plugins</p></li>
<li><p>User sees a list of Plugins that they can install and use for the CMS</p></li>
<li><p>User click ""Install"" and the MEF plugin is installed into the CMS</p></li>
<li><p>User Click ""Turn on"" and the MEF plugin is ready to be used by the system</p></li>
<li><p>User wants to temporary turn off the plugin, user clicks ""Turn Off""</p></li>
<li><p>User no longer needs the plugin and clicks ""Uninstall"" and the plug-in is deleted completely from the CMS system.</p></li>
<li><p>User realizes that they accidentally deleted the wrong plugin, user clicks again ""Install"".</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Goal is to be able to control plugins from an Admin settings type of page being able to install, uninstall, turn on, and turn off would be a great feature to have in a CMS.</p>

<p>I know other CMS uses this type of functions for their plug-ins but don't know of any that Uses MEF as part of their framework to do this.</p>

<p>Most uses their own internal Plugin framework for these functions.</p>

<p>I am hoping to be able to use the MEF framework to help do this.</p>

<p>An other goal is to basically have a system where ""Plugins"" targeting MEF and packaged in Nuget can basically be hosted some where like Nuget.org.</p>

<p>In the Nuget Package, with MEF everything that the ""Plugin"" needs is contained within the Nuget Package.</p>

<p>But, because it is using MEF, this package can technically only contain 1 DLL and when a user install the Nuget Package MEF will register the dll with their website.</p>

<p>Example could be a Blog, in the package it contains everything that is needed.</p>

<p>User goes to Visual Studio Install Nuget Package ""Blog"" and it install 1 dll that contains everything that it needs.</p>

<p>MEF will register the package with the user website and that is it.</p>

<p>No configurations or anything on the user side.</p>

<p>Just Pull and install from Nuget and that is it :)</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>This is the only lock this thread is holding. I've tried briefly googling what the monitor entry value refers to, but didn't have any luck. For this thread, the value [0x000000004dec8000] doesn't appear to refer to an object id and it doesn't appear anywhere else in the stack trace. </p>

<p>I found the <a href=""https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=1582469&amp;tstart=90"" rel=""nofollow"">exact same issue here</a> with no answer and this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/370710/java-6-jvm-hang"">older SO question</a> that says it's a JVM bug caused by not properly assigning the monitor to one of the waiting threads. I'm not completely sure I understand how the a thread could be marked as locking a monitor but not actually given the monitor, but it makes sense that those operations may be separate and a bug in the JVM causes a problem after assigning the lock but before assigning the monitor (although I've always thought of them as the same thing).</p>

<p>The java version I'm using is:</p>

<p>java version ""1.6.0_18""
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_18-b07)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.0-b13, mixed mode)</p>

<p>On:</p>

<p>CentOS release 5.2 (Final)
Kernel version: 2.6.18-194.17.4.el5xen</p>

<p>Is this really just a JVM bug or is there something else I should be looking into?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>The commons-beanutils version we were using was 1.7. We have since upgraded to 1.8 to see if it resolves the issue.</p>

<p>I have the table's ItemsSource bound to a list in my ViewModel, showing a nice list of clickable items. </p>

<p>However I want the cell's accessory (UITableViewCellAccessory.Checkmark) to show only when this object is flagged. By flagged I mean a boolean in the model is set to true.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to bind the cell's accessory?</p>

<p>EDIT:
I can show the Accessory depending on the model's boolean, but it's not bound.</p>

This has been going fine for a few months. Just this week, some of the sub-processes are crashing. I've attached a remote debugger to them, and they're failing in memory allocations (C++ new operator returns 0x0), which is the indirect cause of the crash.</p>

<p>Funny thing is, if I RDP into the machine, I can easily launch the process from CMD no problems. Yet when the service launches it, no go.</p>

<p>The machine is running Windows XP SP3. It isn't out of the commit charge is about 80% of physical RAM.</p>

<p>Are there some special limitations of how many processes or how much memory can be used by a service, including processes spawned by that service??</p>

<p>Any other ideas why these processes would be unable to allocate memory.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I've had a good look at the crashing scenario with Procmon from SysInternals, and it doesn't reveal anything (that I can see). It all looks like it's going normal, then suddenly crashes. I can confirm from attaching a remote debugger that it is crashing after dereferencing a null pointer from a c++ new call. This is one of the first objects allocated in the app, it should never fail.</p>

<p>I also discovered that if I enable to services option: Allow services to interact with desktop, then all of the child processes launch correctly. The do, however, appear on the desktop when you connect via RDP and are unfortunately terminated if you log out via RDP = YUK! This still isn't an ideal solution, though - I'd really like to know why the child processes were unable to allocate memory after the 6th child process.</p>

<p>What it actually worked is putting the exact same formula in another cell. Pause the execution an activate the cell with the formula. Put the formula in the variable Var and then move the activecell to the correct position and insert the variable Var value there.</p>

<pre><code>Var = ActiveCell.formula 'Break point here / Run one step to take formula
ActiveCell.formula = Var 'Move to correct cell manually / Continue execution
</code></pre>

<p>Another thing I tried was removing the ""="" from the formula and it puts the formula in the cell correctly as string.</p>

<p>Any advise or ideas about this?</p>

<p>the element <strong>identifier</strong> changes its value to the value of the attribute <strong>value</strong>, and then the attribute <strong>value</strong> is deleted.</p>

<p>but the problem is i can figure out how to make a loop to do it to all the elements, i change the first element value (dummy) to its attribute value (value1), and the second one gets the first elements value (value1) also, instead of its value (value2)</p>

<p>the code that does so is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=""1.0"" xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform""&gt;

    &lt;!--empty template suppresses this attribute--&gt;

    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

   &lt;xsl:template match=""@value""/&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

At first these charts initialized in vertical order then the user can drag and drop charts any where. So at first 5 charts will be initialized and when I see ""print Preview"" 3 charts will appear in first page and other 2 in the second page. But when I try to drag 4th or 5th chart to near 1,2,3 charts and ""print Preview"" 4th and 5th charts will no be shown in first page.(neither in second page). If only a half of the chart is in first page then only the part in the second page will e shown. Same happens in the other way around.</p>

<p>The problem seems to be with the draggable since when first initialized the browser will automatically assign pages to charts. And if I drag the charts away from the page it will not shown.</p>

<p>How can I resolve this problem???</p>

Header height is limited so the headers are actually narrow.
The header has also the sort indicator (the default arrow/triangle).</p>

<p>When the user changes the width of a column such that it is smaller than the text's width, the text is trimmed with 3 dots at the end. E.g. ""Universi..."" 
So far so good.</p>

<p>The thing is the sort indicator hides part of the trimmed text.
Imagine wide column - the text is fully show and the sort icon is on the right and everthing looks good. Now the user resizes the column. Just before the text is trimmed with 3 dots, the sort indicator starts to hide the right side of the text. At some point the text is trimmed with the sort indicator on top of the 3 dots . E.g. ""Universi.▽"" or even ""Univers▽"".</p>

<p>It looks like the header does not take into account the sort sign.
Is there a simple way to set the sign indicator to not overlap the trimmed text e.g. ""Univer... ▽""?
I need the columns to be resizable and sortable.</p>

<p>I don't want to define a special widget with push button and text box and handle events and trimming and so... it is a serious overhead.</p>

 ""abc""
 ""a$b""
""123""
""IHH""

<p>it is identifying <code>abc</code> as valid but it is also recognizing <code>a$b</code> and <code>a&lt;&gt;'b=b</code> as valid words ! (returning <code>true</code> for those)
I want to understand how to skip <code>a$b</code> and <code>a&lt;&gt;'b=b ??</code> the method should return <code>false</code> for them.</p>

<p>I want to build a very simple Backend server in either Java or PHP that responds to a get commands and returns 2 different JSON results based on keyword (i.e. if the keyword starts with A or is blank, return one result. If it starts with B, return a different one). Once again, I have no idea how to go about this and would greatly appreciate if anyone can solve this for me. It's not homework, I'm just trying to learn and pickup some skills. If anyone really enjoys coding and has time to spare, please help me understand how this is done. Any help is greatly appreciated. Really. Thank you all so much in advance. </p>

<p>I am able to display the first pie chart: ""matchPieChart"" but not the second one ""questionsPieChart"". It does not look like it even process the second chart.</p>

<p>Is there a way to just combine the formulas or show me how to include the other letters in the same formula?</p>

<p>I have Column A with dates and column B with letters: <code>L</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>U</code>. I have the following formulas that add up the letters independently because I couldn't find a way to combine them in one formula:</p>

<pre><code>=SUM((COUNTIFS($A$5:$A$199,""&gt;=""&amp;H2,$B$5:$B$199,""=""&amp;""S"")))

<p>Keep note that the <code>L</code> needs to be divided by <code>2</code> so that might be what makes this trickier. I'm fine with just combining the <code>S</code> and <code>U</code> and keeping the <code>L</code> separate but if you know who to combine them all I'm all for it.</p>

<p>I have one page which has a <code>GridView</code> and another that has a <code>DetailsView</code>. The <code>GridView</code> has a template button on each row with an onClick event that loads the second page with the <code>DetailsView</code> on it.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is; when I click the template button on the <code>GridView</code> it then loads the second page with the <code>DetailsView</code> and inserts that particular record from the <code>GridView</code> into the <code>DetailsView</code> table.</p>

<p>The <code>DetailsView</code> must have paging enabled. I am stuck trying to find out which page index to load with the right record from the <code>GridView</code>. Currently it will just load up the first page index, then I have to click next to the record I need.</p>

<p>Without the paging enabled, I can read my 2 global variables and then load the correct record into the <code>DetailsView</code> table, but with paging enabled I'm not sure how to do it.</p>

<p>On the <code>GridView</code> page:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Details1_ButtonClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    //I set 2 global variables here of the selected EventId and 
    //Details to read when the next page loads
    Response.Redirect(""ErrorDetails.aspx"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>On the <code>DetailsView</code> page.</p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    //without paging I can set the SqlDataSource1.SelectCommand to select 
    //the correct record using one of the global variables
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried to use <code>DetailsView1_PageIndexChanged</code>, <code>DetailsView1_Load</code> and <code>Page_Load</code> to get the value in the first row, but for some reason it is allways a page behind. The variable always shows the ID of the previous page when it loads. I was going to try and keep track of the page for deleting records, but it will not work either.</p>

I have a pseudo-form that uploads data and files, I wrote ""pseudo"" because it's an ajax form so data is sent with jquery to rails with a POST request.

<p>With storage :file it works without any problems, when i receive the file I do:</p>

<pre><code>uploader = ImgObjUploader.new
uploader.store!(params[:image_form][:image])

  obj.image = File.open(session[:image])

<p>Is it possible to use Phalanger (<a href=""https://phalanger.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://phalanger.codeplex.com/</a>) in ASP.NET MVC for just one view and leave everything else using the normal Razor View Engine?</p>

<p><strong>SITUATION</strong></p>

<p>I am currently using ELFinder in my site which I integrated using the ELFinder Connector for .NET.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like to integrate the Responsive File Manager, here:
<a href=""http://www.responsivefilemanager.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.responsivefilemanager.com/index.php</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the aforementioned file manager is written for PHP.</p>

<p>I have read that PHP can be used within MVC using Phalanger (see: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/articles/Phalanger"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/articles/Phalanger</a>)</p>

<p>And I am wondering whether it is at possible to create a PHP view and make this file manager work for my site while at the same time leaving all other pages alone.</p>

<p>Note, I know nothing of PHP at all...</p>

<p>If this is at all possible, how would I go about starting to do this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I found a simple implementation of an <strong>MVC PHP View Engine</strong> here (which is based on <strong>Phalanger</strong>):
<a href=""https://phpviewengine.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://phpviewengine.codeplex.com/</a></p>

<p>I seem to have sort of got it working with TinyMCE. It actually shows up quite nicely, but then when trying to select a file, it throws various JavaScript errors. Here is a link to the demo project I made:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mediafire.com/download/p418f8xp7t9kiz3/PhpMvc.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mediafire.com/download/p418f8xp7t9kiz3/PhpMvc.zip</a></p>

<p>Any geniuses out there who can figure this one out?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>The reason it was working when it shouldn't have been is I was silly enough to have the TinyMCE config point to the author's server.. as follows:</p>

<pre><code>external_filemanager_path:""http://test.albertoperipolli.com/secondaryserver/filemanager/"",
external_plugins: { ""filemanager"" : ""http://test.albertoperipolli.com/secondaryserver/filemanager/plugin.min.js""},
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I actually correct that to point to my local installation, I have the following error:</p>

<p><strong>""The page you are requesting cannot be served because of the extension configuration""</strong></p>

<p>I guess I need to tell IIS / IIS Express how to deal with PHP files. Now looking at this:
<a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2819022"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2819022</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong></p>

<p>Thanks, @Jakub Míšek for the tip. I did get a bit further - I upgraded to Phalanger 4 as advised and also updated to MVC5 while I was at it. It seems the code is being run, but still not successfully. When I try to browse, there is an exception thrown in the <strong>config.php</strong> file as follows:</p>

<pre><code>An exception of type 'PHP.Core.PhpException' occurred in PhpNetCore.dll but was not handled in user code

Additional information: Call to undefined function: 'session_start'
</code></pre>

<p>This is being thrown at the first line of code, which is:</p>

<pre><code>session_start();
</code></pre>

<p>If I comment that out and continue, the next line also throws the same exception.</p>

<p>I've heard that entire frameworks, such as Prado can be run on Phalanger. so i guess I am still doing something wrong here.</p>

<p>I have uploaded my latest attempt to:
<a href=""http://www.mediafire.com/download/2jz85y17znmtlz6/PhpMvc5.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mediafire.com/download/2jz85y17znmtlz6/PhpMvc5.zip</a></p>

<p>Would appreciate it if anyone can provide working example. I will even start a bounty for a large number of points when allowed to and reward it to whoever can give the best answer... as having this file manager in ASP.NET would indeed be awesome.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 4</strong></p>

<p>I am making some pretty good progress now, having worked out a few issues... see screenshot below for current status. I even have it where I am using ONLY <strong>.cshtml</strong> files (the PHP files being called by the file manager are simply being processed by the PHP View Engine), so this is really, really fantastic. It seems I have some more issues to deal with.. if I manage to get it working properly, I will post the solution here for the benefit of others.</p>

<p>Here is how I am consuming it in java project.</p>

<p>Step 1: Create directory org and com using wsimport and include it in src folder of java project.</p>

<p>Step 2: Add the external jars present in sub-folder ""lib"" of folder ""metro""(This folder is actually referring to the folder where I have installed the metro framework). For this goto project->properties->Java Build Path->Libraries->Add external jars and then browse and select these jar files.  </p>

<p>Step 3: Create a new class to communicate with the web service. Here is the class that I am using.</p>

<pre><code>import java.net.URL;
import javax.xml.namespace.QName;
import javax.xml.ws.BindingProvider;
import org.tempuri.IService1;

    {

    try

        Service1 service1 = new Service1(new URL(""http://192.168.1.18/WcfService/Service1.svc?wsdl""), new QName(""http://tempuri.org/"", ""Service1""));
        IService1 port = service1.getBasicHttpBindingIService1();
        ((BindingProvider)port).getRequestContext().put(BindingProvider.ENDPOINT_ADDRESS_PROPERTY, ""http://192.168.1.18/WcfService/Service1.svc"");
        int input = 100;
        String strOutput = port.getData(input);
        System.out.println(strOutput);
    }
    catch(Exception e)
    {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    }
}

<p>Now when I run this java project it ran successfully. </p>

<p>Now I want to do the same for an android project. So in the same manner as above I create an android project which is using android platform 2.2 as the build target and then I follow step 1 and step 2 as described above. Thereafter I create a class having the following code.</p>

<pre><code>package android.client;

public class AndroidClientJavaServerActivity extends Activity {
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);
        try
        {

            Service1 service1 = new Service1(new URL(""http://192.168.1.18/WcfService/Service1.svc?wsdl""), new QName(""http://tempuri.org/"", ""Service1""));

            int input = 100;
            String strOutput = port.getData(input);
            Toast msg = Toast.makeText(getBaseContext(),
                    strOutput, Toast.LENGTH_LONG);
            msg.show();
       }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>After it when I run this android project the application fails in executing successfully.

<p>When I view Customers/Index, I see the following:</p>

<pre><code>Customers 
Customer Name: John Smith 
Orders: (1) 
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that in CustomerPartial.ascx, doing Model.Orders.Count() correctly picks up that 1 order exists.  However PartialForEach(x => x.Orders) does not, as nothing is rendered for the order.  If I set a breakpoint on the Order constructor, I see that it initially gets called by the Index method on CustomersController, but then it gets called by FubuMVC.Core.Models.StandardModelBinder.Bind, so it is getting re-instantiated by FubuMVC and losing the content of the Orders collection.</p>

<p>This isn't quite what I'd expect, I would think that PartialForEach would just pass the domain object directly into the partial.  Am I missing the point somewhere?  What is the 'correct' way to achieve this kind of result in Fubu?</p>

<p>Update:  In case it helps, this is the top few lines of the stacktrace the first time the Order constructor gets hit:</p>

<p>This solved the problem partially, I also added zoom:1 to the canvas css selector, in order to force elements with display:inline-block (as discussed in <a href=""http://shades-of-orange.com/post/2011/09/08/Rendering-problem-with-flot-07-and-excanvas-in-IE8.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">enter link description here</a>). </p>

Most of these entities can have 0 or more free-text notes associated with them. A ""note"" also has some attributes, however, so it would need to be its own table  - I cannot just use an array of strings. So, logically:</p>

<pre><code>EntityA -&gt; 0..* Note
EntityB -&gt; 0..* Note
EntityC -&gt; 0..* Note
</code></pre>

<p>What is the best way to model this in the database?</p>

<p>So far I've come up with 3 alternatives:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A column for the ID of each entity type in the Note table, with a foreign key. This is very ugly, because there are many entities.</p></li>
<li><p>A joining table for each entity table, joining it to Note. This is still ugly, because it doubles the number of tables and may also affect performance (extra join).</p></li>
<li><p>A generic ""entityId"" column in the Note table that logically refers to any of the tables, but is not enforced with a foreign key. I can also use the same PostgreSQL sequence for all the entity IDs so that an auto-generated ID is unique for all entities, not just entities of that type. This isn't fool-proof, though, because somebody could still insert an ID manually.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So far I'm leaning towards the 3rd alternative. It keeps the schema clean, but there is no referential integrity, which is not ideal. Could anyone suggest a better approach?</p>

I want to start Jetty from within the IDE using the jetty:run goal. The problem is that I cannot see any log outputs from Spring, but I suspect the context is indeed being loaded since console log outputs stop briefly - just as long as it would take to load my yet so small Spring context - before throwing an NPE on an Autowired bean. So my suspicion is that something went wrong while starting up the Spring context.</p>

<p>This is the log output just before it ""stops"" briefly:</p>

<p>Now I am confident that I will be able to fix whatever is causing the NPE, but for that I need to see what is happening to my Spring context. I used to work on the same constellation of tools last year, when a colleague had set it up with what I believe was the same configuration as I am using now.</p>

<p>I have searched the web all morning and couldn't find anything useful about it, only the vague suggestion to run Jetty externally and assemble the war and deploy the app, which is exactly not what I want.</p>

<p>This is my pom's build configuration:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;pluginManagement&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
            &lt;plugin&gt;

                    &lt;webXml&gt;src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\web.xml&lt;/webXml&gt;
                    &lt;warName&gt;template&lt;/warName&gt;
                &lt;/configuration&gt;
            &lt;/plugin&gt;
            &lt;plugin&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;org.mortbay.jetty&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;jetty-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;

                    &lt;webXml&gt;src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\web.xml&lt;/webXml&gt;
                    &lt;webApp&gt;
                        &lt;jettyEnvXml&gt;${jettyEnvXml-file}&lt;/jettyEnvXml&gt;
                    &lt;/webApp&gt;
                    &lt;contextPath&gt;template&lt;/contextPath&gt;
                    &lt;systemProperties&gt;
                        &lt;systemProperty&gt;
                            &lt;name&gt;log4j.configuration&lt;/name&gt;
                            &lt;value&gt;file:jetty/log4j-jetty.properties&lt;/value&gt;
                        &lt;/systemProperty&gt;
                    &lt;/systemProperties&gt;
                &lt;/configuration&gt;
            &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;/plugins&gt;
    &lt;/pluginManagement&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this is my log4j configuration for Jetty:</p>

<pre><code>log4j.debug=true
log4j.threshold=ALL

log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, consoleLogger

log4j.appender.consoleLogger=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender

log4j.appender.consoleLogger.layout.ConversionPattern=%-5p [%t]: %m%n
log4j.appender.consoleLogger.Threshold=TRACE
</code></pre>

<p>Could it have to do with this line at the beginning of my log?</p>

<pre><code>SLF4J: Failed to load class ""org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder"".
</code></pre>

<p>But as far as I know it's just an m2e bug that can be ignored. I have slf4j in my classpath though.</p>

<p>When I run my unit tests with HSQL in the SpringJPA module, it works nicely, so I suspect it's a Jetty issue or something with my log4j configuration is just bogus.</p>

<p>Any ideas, hints, helps are greatly appreciated.</p>

"25748274","1","","","2014-09-09 15:18:24","","7","150","<p><strong>Basic question</strong>: is it possible to avoid having to explicitly call the (non-default) constructor of every virtual base class?</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: I'm working on some type-safe C++ wrapper classes around Windows COM objects. My current approach is to have a <code>CBaseCOMWrapper</code> class which encapsulates an <code>IUnknown</code> object for reference counting. Then, I have a <code>CCOMWrapper</code> template class which inherits from <code>CBaseCOMWrapper</code>, which defines a wrapper for specific COM types (i.e. <code>IDXGIObject</code>, <code>ID3D11Device</code>, etc). Finally, separate classes inherit from these wrapper templates to provide actual/extra functionality (i.e. <code>CDXGIObject</code>, <code>CD3D11Device</code>).</p>

<p>For example, I have the following classes (members omitted):</p>

<pre><code>class CBaseCOMWrapper { };

template&lt;typename T&gt; // here, T should inherit from IUnknown
class CCOMWrapper : public virtual CBaseCOMWrapper { };

class CDXGIObject : public virtual CCOMWrapper&lt;IDXGIObject&gt; { };

template&lt;&gt;
class CCOMWrapper&lt;IDXGIAdapter&gt; : public virtual CCOMWrapper&lt;IDXGIObject&gt; { };

class CDXGIAdapter : public virtual CCOMWrapper&lt;IDXGIAdapter&gt; { };
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the corresponding diagram of the type hierarchy:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5gi2u.png"" alt=""Type Hierarchy""></p>

<p>The left column is the actual objects, the middle column the thin COM wrappers, and the right column the actual COM objects. Solid arrows denote inheritance, and dashed arrows denote encapsulation.</p>

<p>I use template specializations of <code>CCOMWrapper</code> to provide the parent-child relationships in the middle.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: The wrapper classes assume a non-NULL (aka valid) pointer to a COM object, so I can't have a default constructor. Because the hierarchy is full of ""diamonds"", much of the inheritance is virtual; this means each class's constructor must call the constructor. So, in the example above, the constructor of <code>CDXGIAdapter</code> must call the constructors of <code>CCOMWrapper&lt;IDXGIAdapter&gt;</code>, <code>CDXGIObject</code>, <code>CCOMWrapper&lt;IDXGIObject&gt;</code>, and <code>CBaseCOMWrapper</code>. As the hierarchy expands (i.e. <code>ID3D11Predicate</code>'s inheritance chain is 4 ""links"" long), this means more constructors must be called.</p>

<p><strong>Possible solution</strong>: Ideally, I'd like to use macros to generate most of the base constructor calls, but I'd have to provide the entire inheritance chain for each COM object; this would require different macros for chains of different lengths. However, the longest such length is 4 (I'm only working with DXGI, D3D11, and D2D1), so this isn't out of the question.</p>

<p>So how can I avoid having to call all the constructors? Alternatively, is there a better way to achieve what I'm trying to do?</p>

<p>So far I've got</p>

<pre><code>    foreach($nodes as &amp;$node) {

<p>When you run this code in Firefox the image load callback gets invoked. On the iPad, load
doesn't get called and nothing renders. 
<p>
I've tried a few things including the <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7731"" rel=""nofollow"">suggestion</a> to set the image.src explicitly prior to setting the callback.
<p>
Also, replacing the load callback with a timer (300 ms delay) doesn't seem to help. The code gets
executed but still nothing renders. Since my target platform is the iPad this is a serious roadblock. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Now what i want to do is when desktop users visit www.domain.com that the are redirected to www.domain.com/home (the speeddoor) and when mobile users visit they will go to www.domain.com</p>

<pre><code>/cfc/
    rest/ -- Rest endpoints
    model/ -- ORM model mappings
    util/ -- some util classes
</code></pre>

<p>It's a pretty simple crud that also gets the metadata for the models for use in the front end.   Basically, any calls from the rest endpoints or cfc's called from the rest endpoints will encounter an error when it's dealing with anything that requires pathing.  For example:</p>

<p><code>getComponentMetaData(""models.table"");</code></p>

<p>errors cannot find componenet models.table.  This is using a mapping to <code>/cfc/model</code>, if I try <code>cfc.model.table</code>, same thing happens, as well as <code>ApplicationName.cfc.model.table</code>.</p>

<p>I have a feeling this is due to how CF is registering the rest endpoints, since it works as a root application, but just stalls out like this when it's in a subdir.  Anyone have any insight on anything that can be done or how CF handles the registration that there might be a work around to it?</p>

<p>Consider the following model:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo(models.Model):
    bar = models.TextField()
    test = models.TextField()  # This field is to go away, bye-bye!
</code></pre>

<p>And migration:</p>

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('app', '0002_foo_test'),

            model_name='foo',
            name='test',
        ),
    ]

<p>Unapplying this migration throws an exception:</p>

<p>Of course, this is the expected behaviour, it is <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/migration-operations/#removefield"" rel=""nofollow"">clearly documented</a> and I'm not asking why this happens:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bear in mind that when reversed this is actually adding a field to a
  model; if the field is not nullable this may make this operation
  irreversible (apart from any data loss, which of course is
  irreversible).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, we all make mistakes and sometimes we just <strong>need</strong> to <em>somehow</em> reverse a field deletion, even if that means manually providing an ad hoc stub value for all reversed non-null fields. For instance, South migrations optionally allow the reversal of such operations (by asking the developer on whether to provide a default for restored fields, or disallow reverse migration), which doesn't seem to be the case with the all new fancy Django 1.7 migrations.</p>

<p><strong>Question: what is the easiest/fastest way to undo a field removal with Django 1.7+ migrations (assuming it has already happened)?</strong> It doesn't necessarily need to be fully scripted with Python, a set of manual instructions will do.</p>

On the first page we gather information that will allow us to identify which database record to update. On the second page we gather new values used to update this record. In order for this to work, we need a way to persists information between the two pages, including some record id.</p>

<p>I though of two way to do this and both have some problem.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Store the information in the Session object.</p>

<p>This works as long as the user does not open a second browser window or tab. If he does there is a risk that he'll apply the modifications to the wrong record. Suppose he opens tab 1 and complete the first step. Record id 1 is stored in the Session object. The user then open tab 2 and complete the first step. Record id 2 is then stored in the Session object overwriting record id 1. The user then come back to the first tab and complete the second step thinking he is editing record 1, but in fact he will be editing record 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Store the information in an hidden field on the page.</p>

<p>This would solve the problem solution 1 has, but it would be trivial for a ill-intentioned user to change the record id to overwrite any record. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>While typing this question I just though of a third solution. That is an hybrid of theses two, but I'm not sure it's completely safe. We could store a random id in an hidden field on the page and use this to prefix the key we use to access data in the session object. I think this would work. Could this be exploited as solution 2 could?</p>

<p>Any other good way to securely store data ""per tab"" instead of ""per session""?</p>

<p>I use entityManager in Vaadin framework. Implemented this pattern (ThreadLocal and filter for generating entityManager for every request): </p>

<p><a href=""https://vaadin.com/book/-/page/jpacontainer.hibernate.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vaadin.com/book/-/page/jpacontainer.hibernate.html</a></p>

<p>If i write a test it is works like charm:</p>

<pre><code>EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(""applicLiquidator.applicLiquidator"");
log.trace(""created entityManageFactory:"" + entityManagerFactory);
EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();

CaseEntity case= entityManager.getReference(CaseEntity .class, 1);
entityManager.detach(case);
case.setCompanyFullName(""TEST1"");

entityManager.getTransaction().begin();
CaseEntity newCase=entityManager.merge(case);
entityManager.getTransaction().commit();
</code></pre>

<p>However in the application server it works entirely other way, i logged ever information and seems everything is OK, the entity has the good values!</p>

<pre><code>   public static int saveCase(CaseEntity case, boolean sameTransaction) throws DALException {
        EntityTransaction transaction = null;
        try {

<p>As you can see, i tried refresh, clear, flush everything. Important to note here that case is a detached object, but as far as i know merge will do the job but the reference will not copied to the original object, but will (should) update the entity with the same id... </p>

<p>In other cases (with other entites this code is works like charm), only with one case, the first one entity at the database with id 1 is making bug!</p>

<p>I cannot understand why it is, why it is working some cases, and why it is not... And why it is that <strong>i see the good values in the entity attibutes</strong> and it just doesn't generate the update sql and doesn't make the merge/update in the persistance context and also at the database, no error message, nothing to show, only missfunction...</p>

<p>If anyone ever experience this kind of mistic bug/issue i would more than appreciate the answer or any slight idea, anything came in to your mind pls take time to answer.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This is a simple mockup of the actual game to make sure I can get the mechanism to work correctly. 'death' and 'gold_koi_pond' are all functions contained within the class Rooms.</p>

<p>I have three samples of the engine that I want to compare. I'll call them 1, 2 and 3 respectively.</p>

<p>#1 works:</p>

<pre><code>class Engine(object):
    def __init__(self, start):
        self.start = start

    def play(self):
        next = self.start

        while True:
            g = Rooms()
            room = getattr(Rooms, next)
            next = room(g)


from rooms import Rooms

a = Engine(""princess_lives_here"")
a.play()
</code></pre>

<p>#2 works:</p>

<pre><code>class Engine(object):
    def __init__(self, start):
         self.start = start

    def play(self):
         next = self.start

        while True:
             next = getattr(Rooms, next)(Rooms())


from rooms import Rooms

a = Engine(""princess_lives_here"")
a.play()
</code></pre>

<p>#3 does not work:</p>

<pre><code>class Engine(object):
    def __init__(self, start):
        self.start = start

    def play(self):
        next = self.start

        while True:
            room = getattr(Rooms, next)
            next = room()


from rooms import Rooms

a = Engine(""princess_lives_here"")
a.play()
</code></pre>

<p>I'm having a hard time understanding the difference between the three options. Is one better than the other? What exactly is happening in python that makes 1 and 2 work, but not 3? Is there a better way to accomplish what I want to do?</p>

<p>Also, randint and exit don't import when Rooms is run from engine.py. Why is this?</p>

<p>Thanks for any help! I'm open to all advice and critiques, not just about the questions I'm interested in.</p>

The issue is that said permission groups are Active Directory groups (which may be the reason I am having issues, but I am unsure).  I am using the SOAP request AddUserToRole and seem to be getting an error.  According to the error message:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;errorstring xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/sharepoint/soap/""&gt;Permission level cannot be found.&lt;/errorstring&gt;

<p>I am a bit stumped as I am pulling the permission levels directly from the permission list via: SPServices (operation: ""GetPermissionCollection"").  I have pushed out the results to console and verified that the list being produced maps to the Permission List (Site Actions > Site Settings > Site Permissions).  I also made sure the user specific parameters the SOAP request contains are accurate, which they are.  Is it simply impossible to add users to Permission groups created in AD?  I know its impossible to dig into AD groups via SP Web Services... unless this has changed?</p>

<p>So is it AD causing this issue?</p>

<p>Based on the <code>Question</code> type there needs to be different formType used which contains only some of the <code>Option</code> fields.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><code>Question</code> with <code>type = X</code> should have form with fields <code>$field_for_question_type_x</code></p>

<p><code>Question</code> with <code>type = Y</code> should have form with fields <code>$field_for_question_type_y</code></p>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>I also have those different formTypes created so the question is how could I tell Sonata Admin <code>$formMapper</code> to add collection of such forms(based on Question entity type)?</p>

<p>Currently it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>protected function configureFormFields(FormMapper $formMapper)
{
    $Question = $this-&gt;getSubject();

    $formMapper-&gt;add('test_field');

    if ($Question-&gt;getId()) {

        switch ($Question-&gt;getType()) {
            case 'X':
                // Here I would need to add collection of \My\Bundle\Form\OptionXType()
                $formMapper-&gt;add('options', ????????);
                break;
            case 'Y':
                // Here I would need to add collection of \My\Bundle\Form\OptionYType()
                $formMapper-&gt;add('options', ????????);
                break;
        }

<p>Architecturally, how would you manage this in a Rails project? What's the best practice to a) produce the correct query and b) manage the code in Rails?</p>

<p>Currently for the sql, I'm using a subquery in the FROM statement:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *,

FROM (
  SELECT *,

  JOIN bills_of_materials ON widget.id = bills_of_materials.widget_id
  JOIN materials ON bills_of_materials.material_id = materials.id
  GROUP BY widgets.id
) AS widgets;

<p>In rails, I have this implemented mostly using ActiveRecord:</p>

<pre><code>class Widget &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :factory
  has_many :bills_of_material
  has_many :materials, through :bills_of_material

  class &lt;&lt; self
    def with_quality

        ""(0.4 * factory_quality + 0.3 * (1/days_since_manufacture) + 0.3 * materials_quality) AS quality""

        .group(""widgets.id"")
        .to_sql
      end
  end
end

<p>That said, I feel like I could make this a custom function in Postgres, move all this sql in to that function, migrate it, and clean up the rails to look like</p>

<pre><code>def with_scores
  select(""*,quality_score_func(id) AS quality"")
end
</code></pre>

<p>or something to that effect, but I feel like it will be a pain in the ass to manage what will be an evolving formula through database migrations, not to mention somewhat of a task to find out what the current form of the formula is (and also difficult to test).</p>

<p>I wrote a shell script to automate the installation of Passenger &amp; Nginx (along with some other components) without any user input on a Vagrant VM running Ubuntu 14.04.  It works fine using the following:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""****** Adding Passenger &amp; Nginx Repo ******""
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 561F9B9CAC40B2F7
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates -y

    sudo chown root: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/passenger.list
    sudo chmod 600 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/passenger.list
    sudo apt-get update
echo ""****** Installing Passenger &amp; Nginx ******""
    sudo apt-get install nginx-extras passenger -y
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to do the same thing for a Vagrant VM running CentOS 6.4. I followed the directions for CentOS found on the <a href=""https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Nginx.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Phusion Passenger site</a> but I can't seem to get it working properly.  When I do the following, the output from the shell script says ""No package passenger available."":</p>

<pre><code>echo ""****** Adding Passenger &amp; Nginx Repo ******""
    sudo yum install epel-release pygpgme curl -y
    sudo 'echo ""curl --fail -sSLo /etc/yum.repos.d/passenger.repo https://oss-binaries.phusionpassenger.com/yum/definitions/el-passenger.repo""'
    sudo chown root: /etc/yum.repos.d/passenger.repo
    sudo chmod 600 /etc/yum.repos.d/passenger.repo
    sudo yum update
echo ""****** Installing Passenger &amp; Nginx ******""
    sudo yum install nginx passenger -y
</code></pre>

<p>Looking in the /etc/yum.repos.d directory after the script is run, there is no passenger.repo listed, so it looks like for whatever reason curl is not downloading the repo file.  However, if I manually type the commands in my terminal command line after the script finishes it will pull down the repo and run.</p>

<p>I'm probably doing something stupid here, but I'm rather new to shell scripting and can't seem to figure out where the problem is.</p>

<p>I've implemented this using <code>UISearchDisplayController</code>, and it mostly does the right thing, except it's failing to hide the navigation bar.  The view hierarchy is stacked like this:</p>

<pre><code>UIWindow
+-&gt; IIViewDeckController
  +-&gt;UINavigationController
    +-&gt;UITableViewController
</code></pre>

<p>I've initialized things like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    UISearchBar *searchBar = [[UISearchBar alloc] init];
    self.searchDisplayController = [[UISearchDisplayController alloc] initWithSearchBar:searchBar contentsController:self];
    self.tableView.tableHeaderView = searchBar;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried using a different drawer controller to see if the problem is in IIViewDeckController, like this:</p>

<pre><code>UIWindow
+-&gt; MMDrawerController
  +-&gt;UINavigationController
    +-&gt;UITableViewController
</code></pre>

<p>Normally, <code>UISearchDisplayController</code> should call <code>-[UINavigationController setNavigationBarHidden:animated:]</code> from somewhere in <code>-[UISearchDisplayController setActive:animated:]</code>.  I've even tried creating a class derived from <code>UISearchDisplayController</code> and overloading <code>-[UISearchDisplayController setActive:animated:]</code> and manually hiding the navigation bar, like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)setActive:(BOOL)visible animated:(BOOL)animated
{
    [self.searchContentsController.navigationController setNavigationBarHidden:visible animated:animated];
    [super setActive:visible animated:animated];
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Update for clarity</em>: this code does actually hide the navbar as expected, but it doesn't clear out views that are north of the search bar and I wind up with another view sitting on top of the status bar (which kinda makes sense, because while debugging through <code>-[UISearchDisplayController setActive:animated:]</code> I found that it uses some private APIs to clear out refresh controllers when it hides the navbar.  I think.</p>

<p>For some reason the navigation bar isn't hiding and I've been having a devil of a time trying to figure out why.</p>

<p>What could cause this behavior?</p>

<p><strong>Update #2</strong></p>

<p>Looks like I missed a view in the hierarchy, and it seems to be the culprit in some way (still not sure in what way, exactly).  Here it is:</p>

<pre><code>UIWindow
+-&gt; MMDrawerController
   +-&gt; UINavigationController
      +-&gt; UITabBarController
         +-&gt; UITableViewController

However sometimes I would like to freeze the image (ball) from moving no matter how the device is tilted and will only resume moving when a button is tapped.  I'm not sure how to do this.  I have tried to changing the value of x or y by setting y = 0; such as this.</p>

<p>I have a class ""Gebruiker"" (=dutch for user). Each Gebruiker/User-object has a ""String Gebruikersnaam (=username)"" and a ""String Password"". The ""Boolean type"" decides if the user is an administrator (true) or a normal user (=false). </p>

<pre><code>public class Gebruiker implements Serializable{

        private String gebruikersnaam;

<p>A method in this class returns the username as a String.</p>

<p>In have an <code>ArrayList&lt;Gebuiker&gt; gebruikers;</code>, where i store all the Users. </p>

<p>The If-statement in the code below compares the username from a given ""Gebruiker""-object using my methode <code>""gebr.getGebruikersnaam()""</code> with the text in a Username input field ""LogOnName"". So i compare a string with a string, but i get an error there... </p>

<pre><code> for (Gebruiker gebr : gebruikers) {

<p>So, using IE8, we go to maps.google.com , ask for a street view, it works fine. Same machine, IE8, go to our ExtJS application and ask for a street view, it is not that smooth, much slower. Same machine, Firefox (or even IE9), it is smooth enough. </p>

<p>Some thoughts : </p>

<ul>
<li>Having a look with Firebug and Fiddler it seems that the images are properly cached. So it doesn't seem that we are asking for too many requests. I mean, panning is still slow even if we don't perform any image request at all.</li>
<li>maps.google.com does not need to authenticate as our app does, but for the previous reason, I would not think that is the problem.</li>
<li>It is slow no matter we remove additional markers or the map including the pegman besides.</li>
<li>This happens even if the window size is not too big. That is, smaller than the window we use for testing with maps.google.com </li>
<li>I can see a CPU usage when panning of roughly 30% using street view in our application and 15% with maps.google.com</li>
</ul>

<p>The code we use is not very different from the example :</p>

<p><a href=""https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/streetview-simple"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/streetview-simple</a></p>

<p>Any idea will be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>Update. To simplify the problem, I tried getting rid of ExtJS. So I just open another window with the simple HTML below. Even that way, its performance is worse than just going to maps.google.com .</p>

<p>It is like the presence of the nested frame occludes that branch of the tree from the search.</p>

<p>As you can see drevil is lurking. </p>

<p>Note, Tomalak is correct in that the 2nd match on * has no effect (other than to remove spaces from the output which is a bit odd!).</p>

<p>It just twigged though that I might not be able to go with the XSLT approach, the whole point of doing an  XPath query in the first place was to gain references to nodes within the original HTML document. If I do a transform, the nodes contained in the <em>new</em> result document will be copies and not the original ones I'm looking for and thus no use! </p>

<p>This might be the dumbest question ever, but is there a way to maintain a references from nodes in the transformed document to nodes in the original?</p>

<p>Thanks Tomalak, Robert and mykhal for your help so far. I think I just need to buy a book on XSLT... </p>

The setup is pretty basic: you press one of the buttons and the corresponding sample will play. Everything works pretty smoothly, but unfortunately there appears to be a small (though annoying) latency between the moment you put your finger down and the playback of the sound. I've tried to measure the amount of latency (by ear), it seems to be something like 0.05 - 0.1 seconds.</p>

<p>The audio playback has been implemented using the AudioToolbox framework (Extended Audio File Services, Audio Units). The sounds are streamed from file, which are stored on the device, to prevent loading times between different soundbanks. Samples are in raw wav format (Linear PCM, 16 bit little-endian signed integer, 2 channels, 44100 Hz), which should be the fastest to process as far as I understand (opposed to something compressed like mp3).</p>

<p>I've measured the time between the button press (UIButton touch event) and the delivery of the first frames of the sample to the mixer (through the playback callback). It is quite stable and between 0.02 to 0.03 seconds. To me this seems pretty fast, but it might not be fast enough.</p>

<p>Could that be the problem or might it be something else like a delay in the delivery of touch events?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>As suggested by Till, I've rewritten the loading of the samples. They are now all preloaded into memory, so disk IO is no longer an issue. On top of that I was doing quite a bit of memcpy for an echo effect, I've disabled it and will fix that later with a linked list kind of solution.</p>

<p>Though this reduces the latency, button press->playback still measures between 0.005 to 0.02 seconds (but more often like 0.02). This is still noticeable. I'm thinking this might be due to the buffer size of the playback callback, which is currently 1024 bytes. </p>

<p>Any ideas on how to do that? Setting kAudioUnitProperty_MaximumFramesPerSlice doesn't seem to work.</p>

I'd like an effect similar to this, but without the ""move to find best fit"".</p>

<p>Right now I'm using a table to store some data, each cell of size 300x250. The problem arises when a user increases the size of the page, since cells are rigid and will not reduce column size to compensate, and I end up with cells outside the width of the page, necessitating scrolling.</p>

<p>How can I achieve this effect? To summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>start with for example 5 columns that span the width of the page</li>
<li>if the user zooms in to the point where an element would go beyond the width of a page, make it into four columns instead</li>
<li>if the user zooms out, have it go back to five columns (but cap it at five)</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there an easy method to get this tiling scheme? Here's an image to illustrate:</p>

<p>I have already found out that URLs can have the <strong>useskin=</strong> added (e.g. as is done in the Preview Skin page within the User Preferences pages), but following the links will revert you to your normal chosen skin.</p>

<p>Is there perhaps some way to adjust the skin, so that all the links contain useskin=? (I think this might have issues, since you appear to need the full pagename for useskin to work (e.g. <strong>..../w/index.php?title=blah....&amp;useskin=cologneblue</strong> as opposed to the short URLs).</p>

<p>If this isn't a smart way to go, I could consider different approaches (I run the box the wiki is on and could create a distinct wiki perhaps, although there might be disadvantages to this, such as needing to combine the user tables and maybe this would still pick up the user's preferred skin unless I re-coded things).</p>

<p>Any sensible suggestions gratefully received! Let me know if there's any more info you might need or if I need to clarify any points about my objective.</p>

</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>From Google.js controller (the <code>console.log($scope.businessName);</code> is printing out <code>siz</code> in this example):</p>

<pre><code>$scope.findGPlace2 = function() {
  console.log($scope.businessName);
  GoogleService.findPlace2($scope.businessName).then(function(data) {
    $scope.gPlace2 = data;
    // for(var i = 0; i &lt; data.results.length; i++) {
    //   console.log(data.results[i]);
    // }
    showGData(data.results[0].place_id);
  });
};

<pre><code>  analyticsApp.directive('googleplace', function() {
  return {

</code></pre>

<p>Assuming that I have separate classes implementing each interface, and the assemblies containing those classes compile and register successfully, I import the type libraries into Delphi creating UserMaintenance_TLB.pas and UserInfo_TLB.pas.  However, I see something unexptected: while the interfaces that I defined in .NET exist (the ones beginning with ""I""), Delphi has generated another set of interfaces (the ones beginning with ""_"").  Delphi does <em>not</em> use the I-interfaces that I declared in .NET at all.</p>

<p><strong>Delphi</strong></p>

<pre><code>UserMaintenance_TLB.pas

// *********************************************************************//
// Forward declaration of types defined in TypeLibrary                    
// *********************************************************************//
  IUserMaintenance = interface;
  IUserMaintenanceDisp = dispinterface;
  _UserMaintenance = interface;
  _UserMaintenanceDisp = dispinterface;

UserInfo_TLB.pas

// *********************************************************************//
// Forward declaration of types defined in TypeLibrary                    
// *********************************************************************//
  IUserInfo = interface;
  IUserInfoDisp = dispinterface;
  _UserInfo = interface;
  _UserInfoDisp = dispinterface;
</code></pre>

<p>Delphi has also created the corresponding Delphi types:</p>

<pre><code>// *********************************************************************//
// OLE Server Proxy class declaration
// Server Object    : TUserMaintenance
// Help String      : 
// Default Interface: _UserMaintenance
// Def. Intf. DISP? : No
// Event   Interface:
// TypeFlags        : (2) CanCreate
// *********************************************************************//

  TUserMaintenance = class(TOleServer)
  private
    FIntf:        _UserMaintenance;
    function      GetDefaultInterface: _UserMaintenance;
  protected
    procedure InitServerData; override;
    function Get_ToString: WideString;
  public
    constructor Create(AOwner: TComponent); override;
    destructor  Destroy; override;
    procedure Connect; override;
    procedure ConnectTo(svrIntf: _UserMaintenance);
    procedure Disconnect; override;
    function Equals(obj: OleVariant): WordBool;
    function GetHashCode: Integer;
    function GetType: _Type;
    WordBool AssignUser(IUserInfo userInfo);
    property DefaultInterface: _UserMaintenance read GetDefaultInterface;
    property ToString: WideString read Get_ToString;
  published
  end;
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to do is create an instance of TUserMaintenance, and then pass an instance of TUserInfo to it.  However, two things are immediately obvious: The Delphi class TUserInfo does NOT implement IUserInfo, and the DefaultInterface is the new interface that Delphi generated, _UserInfo.  I cannot declare my UserInfo variable as type IUserInfo because TUserInfo does not implement the interface.  Nor can I declare it as type _UserInfo because UserMaintenance.LoadUser expects an IUserInfo instance.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this is a much simplified example of my actual issue, but I think that it sufficiently illustrates the problem.</p>

<p>So my question is this: is there any way for me to force the interface type in Delphi to remain consistent with the interface that is declared in .NET?  Or is there <em>another</em> way that I can pass an instance of UserInfo to UserMaintenance?</p>

<p>Say I have want to render different objects doing different things on the canvas with 30 fps. There're 2 ways to achieve this.</p>

<p>For both 2 ways, there should be a main <code>setInterval</code> function that <code>draw</code> all objects in 30fps.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Every object has a <code>nextframe(user_response)</code> method, which changes the 'status' of this object according to user response, and is called by a main <code>setInterval</code> 30 times ps. The main <code>setInterval</code> need to pass user responses into each <code>nextframe(...)</code> in some way, and it calls <code>draw</code> for each object.
--The problem with this approach is that all <code>nextframe</code> for all objects are called per frame, taking system resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Objects implement their own animation methods with<code>setInterval</code>. These methos get called according to user response, changing the object 'status' 30 times per second. And the main <code>setInterval</code> function only calls <code>draw</code> for each object in 30fps, behaving like 'taking pictures' of each object's status. The object statuses change independently in other threads. So there's always one main thread of 30fps running, and if there're <code>m</code> objects animated and <code>n</code> object not animated at the moment, there're <code>(m+1)</code> threads in total --The problem with this that when many objects are animated I have many threads running, which also takes system resources.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, which one is a more appropriate method? or are they both wrong? :>
thank you in advance!</p>

<p>Imagine this embedded device: Some lower program layer handles a chip card reader and reacts on the user input by determining three states: ""Card in"", ""Card out"", ""Card error"". Adequate low-level actions are performed here. Call this a state machine.</p>

<p>The lower layer reports the state to some <strong>upper program layer</strong> which reacts on <strong>changes</strong> and communicates with the rest of the system, i.e. sends messages, switches LEDs etc.</p>

<p>The program logic in this <em>upper layer</em> can also be modelled (UML 2) like a simplified state machine on its own: it has transitions between the states and - most importantly - <strong>entry and exit actions</strong>. The states are basically the same as in the lower layer, but not necessary (e.g. might be reduced to ""Card OK"", ""Card not OK"").</p>

<p>The big difference is that this ""upper layer state machine"" doesn't do any <strong>decision</strong> - it merely <strong>reacts</strong> on the state it gets from the lower level and provides actions. The state/transition/action model is just a nice way to visualise the logic to the reader (and, of course, to tell the compiler what to do...) in a well-arranged way.</p>

<p>Or, put it differently: in a ""real"" state machine, as I understand it, the <em>state's</em> logic decides the next state to transition to. In the ""passive"" variant, some <em>outer</em> entity does the decision and the states follow accordingly. Consequence: <em>all</em> transistions between the states must be possible in the upper level.</p>

<p>But is this actually a ""finite state <em>machine</em>"" (I imagine something active here)? Or is there a better term around that ephasises the passive character of this model?</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for the replies! Two figures to clarify. Of course both are state machines. However I see some qualitative difference: imagine the ""lower level"" SM has direct contact to the hardware (valves, sensors) and knows the system it reflects. For instance, only state ""normal"" can react to the ""test button"", the others can't. Not all transitions are possible.
The ""higher level"" is considered ""dumb"" and should only visualise/report the input it gets from lower level. So <em>all</em> transitions must be possible. The state-switch-logic is the same for all states an would be implemented <em>outside</em> the states (thinking as a programmer) to avoid redundancy. It doesn't decide, it just does the entry/exit actions.</p>

If something is not clear, am am very happy to add more details, but please request these in a <em>comment</em> and not in an ""answer"". Thanks.</p>

<p>First I will describe the current situation, and then follows what we want to achieve and the actual question. Despite this being a rather long post to get some context, the question itself is rather short (see at the end).</p>

<h1>The Application Split challenge</h1>

<h2>Application description:</h2>

<p>The app allows the user to configure a number of hardware devices(*)
 and then communicate with these to control and collect measurement 
channels of a physical experiment.</p>

<p>(*) Hardware devices include temperature sensors, pressure sensors, 
motors, ... Communication ranges from serial port communication, 
TCP/UDP communication to interfacing with the drivers of 3rd party 
plugin cards.</p>

<p>Control involves sending commands to the various hardware devices 
to configure them according to the protocols they support. 
Measuring involves getting the data from (some of) these devices.</p>

<p>We are hard pressed to keep the whole thing running as customers 
demand more and more channels at higher sample rates and we have to 
keep up with writing the data+timestamps we get from all devices to 
disk, display a subset of the data and still keep the system 
responding properly.</p>

<h2>Current situation:</h2>

<pre><code>[ DisplayAndControl.exe      ]

  ||                    /\
  || DLL Interface      ||
  ||                    || Window Messages (SendMessage, PostMessage)
  ||                    ||
  \/                    ||

[ ChannelManager.dll         ]
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>ChannelManager.dll (Native C++ DLL on Windows)</p>

<ul>
<li>Manages n data channels (physical measurement variables)</li>
<li>Each channel holds a shifting arbitrary number of samples with
high-precision timestamps</li>
<li>Allows to group channels and write their ongoing updates or 
historical values (""measurement"") to disk</li>
<li>Calculations with channels (arithmetic, integration, mean 
values, etc.)</li>
<li>Interfaces with (realtime) hardware devices to get the timestamps
and values of channels</li>
<li>Get value+timestamp from hardware and save in internal
ring buffer for channel</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>DisplayAndControl.exe (Native C++ MFC App on Windows)</p>

<ul>
<li>Control the functions of ChannelManager.dll (configure channels
and HW devices)</li>
<li>Live display current values/timestamps/changes of all channels</li>
<li>Graph values of (groups of) channels in diagrams</li>
<li>print diagrams and tables of channel values</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary of current situation:</strong> </p>

<p>The application as it is at the moment is already somewhat modular 
in that the (main) executable does the display+interaction and the 
(one of several) DLL does the data management (saving of live data 
to disk, communication with devices, etc.)</p>

<p>From a performance POV, communication btw. the display module and 
the data management module is optimally performant at the moment.</p>

<h2>New situation:</h2>

<pre><code>[ DisplayAndControl.exe      ]

  ||                     /\
  || ? RPC/Messaging     ||
  ||                     || ? RPC/Messaging
  ||                     ||
  \/                     ||

[ ChannelManager.exe (same PC or another)  ]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Summary of the envisioned new situation:</strong></p>

<p>For usability, performance and safety reasons, we wish to split up 
this Windows app into two separate applications, so that the 
performance (and safety) sensitive ChannelManager module can run as 
a separate process possibly on a separate Windows PC.</p>

<p><em>Additionally</em>, since we're already going to split this, we will 
allow for multiple DisplayAndControl.exe apps connected to one 
single ChannelManager.exe.</p>

<p>One QUESTION now is what technology we should use to facilitate the 
communication btw. the now two (or, rather, <code>1 : small_n</code>) applications.</p>

<p>Performance is important, because a lot of data travels btw. the 
two applications and latency should be kept to a minimum. It ""only"" 
needs to work on Windows, but it should be usable from native C++ 
only which makes all purely .NET based technologies unattractive. 
(Note: Porting parts of DisplayAndControl.exe to .NET/WPF is 
planned, but ChannelManager.exe should stay pure native, as we 
don't want any .NET stuff running inside this process.)</p>

<p><em>Regarding latency</em>: It is important that we achieve some level of
soft-realtime in the sense that small latency is acceptable, but 
large and especially varying latency is not acceptable for usability 
and safety reasons. Therefore any protocol that would help in 
getting some sort of (soft) realtime behavior would be preferred.</p>

<p>RPC technologies we've looked at:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>WCF (or .NET remoting) - Is dotnet only, therefore not 
attractive. Performance figures are also not very good. </p></li>
<li><p>(D)COM - COM is great for Windows RPC communication, but it 
breaks down once you have to have inter-PC comm because it is 
horrible to get the security settings working in a corporate IT 
network.</p></li>
<li><p>CORBA - We have had good experience with CORBA communications in 
the past. The communication is easy to get working; there's not 
much infrastructure overhead; it works well from C++; writing 
a .NET wrapper is pretty trivial. The problem with CORBA is that
it's somewhat complicated to use correctly in C++ (people will use
a lot of time on chasing memory leaks, esp. inexperienced C++ 
devs). It also will be a learning curve for every developer and
every new developer, as no one expects people to ""know"" CORBA 
nowadays. Also, it might not perform as well as we'd like it to and
as far as I know there's no readily available realtime support.</p></li>
<li><p>Thrift - still looks half-baked to use in our scenario.</p></li>
<li><p>ICE (from ZeroC) - I would prefer ICE over CORBA anytime, after all
it promises to be a ""better CORBA"" and I think it does deliver on
that. However, their licensing policy is very suboptimal as they do not sell development licenses but only license per 
installation. (Well that's what they told us last time we asked end of 2009.) Their licensing policy also suggests that any 3rd party possibly interested in interfacing with our modules would first have to negotiate a license contract with ZeroC too.</p></li>
<li><p>Open MPI - Message Passing interface seems to be targeted at 
scenarios with lots of clients ""heavily"" distributed. Doesn't seem
to fit our problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing our own communication layer using TCP/UDP - Oh my. I'd 
rather not :-)</p></li>
<li><p>Google Protocol Buffers - Is <em>not</em> an RPC technology.</p></li>
<li><p>Distributed Shared Memory - Well. This got thrown in by a few 
devs and <em>I</em> for one am neither sure if there's a working 
implementation nor if it fit's our problem.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So again the QUESTION - <strong>what ""RPC""-like technology would you prefer 
in this situation and why?</strong></p>

Create master application to run other applications by combining code in visual studio.</p>

<p>Details:
I have 3 projects (all c#) that i can open in visual studio. They all work. They are all GUI based applications. I want to create a master application with just a few buttons on it that will open each application if the corresponding button is clicked. </p>

<p>I know that i can accomplish this by ""System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(@""program1.exe"");"" but i don't want to package it all together and have to give my coworkers multiple exe files and hope they read the instructions and execute the right file. I would like to instead take all the .cs files from the applications and import them into my master application. I want program1's files to kick off when i press program1button and have it start as it normally does. Is this possible?</p>

<p>example:
This master application will look like the below description. When program1button is clicked i want to run program1. </p>

<pre><code>_____________________
| master application|

This works great when saving the data using <code>.persist()</code> however there's an odd behavior involving transactions. The following code is from Hibernate's own <a href=""http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.3/quickstart/en-US/html/files/hibernate-tutorials.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">quickstart tutorial code</a>:</p>

<pre><code>// now lets pull events from the database and list them
entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();
entityManager.getTransaction().begin();
List&lt;Event&gt; result = entityManager.createQuery( ""from Event"", Event.class ).getResultList();
for ( Event event : result ) {
  System.out.println( ""Event ("" + event.getDate() + "") : "" + event.getTitle() );
}
entityManager.getTransaction().commit();
entityManager.close();
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the unusual transaction begin/commit wrapping the query to select the data. Running this gives the following output after the query completes:</p>

<p>It appears that since the <code>Integrator</code> does a modification on the entity in question it gets marked as ""dirty"" and upon committing this odd transaction, it bypasses my event listeners and writes the value back in the wrong format! I did some digging in the code and it turns out that <code>org.hibernate.event.internal.AbstractFlushingEventListener.flushEntities(FlushEvent, PersistenceContext)</code> gets called above and tries to get listeners for <code>EventType.FLUSH_ENTITY</code>. Unfortunately a listener added for this <code>EventType</code> is never called in my <code>Integrator</code>. How can I write my <code>Integrator</code> to behave correctly in this case so that I can ""undo"" the conversion that has happened with my entities at runtime and not flush the wrong value out?</p>

<p>But when the task for the 2nd batch runs, NDB throws <code>BadRequest</code> error saying that the cursor is out of range.</p>

<p>I don't understand why it's out of range? I fetched 10 records out of a total of 31, so the cursor should still be valid.</p>

<p>Note that the error is thrown on the 2nd batch (i.e. records 11-20).</p>

<p>So the flow is like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Call <code>/queue_all_users</code> to process the first batch (no cursor). Everything works ok.</li>
<li>Step 1 creates a task for <code>/queue_all_users?cursor=123456</code> for the next batch.</li>
<li>Call <code>/queue_all_users?cursor=123456</code> (cursor provided). <code>fetch_page</code> throws <code>BadRequestErrror</code>.</li>

Some clients of one vendor may be clients of a different vendor. Some vendors might actually be clients of another vendor.</p>

<p>I currently have a table for the super-type 'party' with primary key <code>party_ID</code>, a table for the subtype 'company' with primary key <code>company_ID</code> (references <code>party_ID</code>) and a table for the role of 'vendor' with primary key <code>vendor_ID</code> (references <code>company_ID</code>). I also have a junction table, 'client' with a composite primary key of <code>vendor_ID</code> and <code>party_ID</code>.</p>

<p>My question is how should the 'order' table reference the vendor and client tables? My first thought is that the table should have a composite primary key of <code>vendor_ID</code>, <code>client_ID</code> and <code>order_ID</code> (<code>order_ID</code> could be auto-increment across the table or sequential per <code>vendor_ID + client_ID</code>)
but this seemed a bit fishy as there were three attributes making up the key...</p>

<p>Does anyone have any insight into this topic? Most 'shopping carts' only deal with a single vendor, so the order table simply lists <code>client_ID</code> as a foreign key.</p>

So far so good, the specialization itself is easy to provide, I've already done similar things for <code>numeric_limits&lt;&gt;</code>. But I'm facing the problem of how to provide the specialization in a way that is <em>portable</em> to C++11 and -pre-11 (C++03 or whatever).</p>

<p>The problem I'm bumping on, of course, is that <code>hash&lt;&gt;</code> can be defined in one of several namespaced, and I'm forced to provide the specialization in the same namespace.</p>

<pre><code>// in c++11
namespace std { struct hash&lt;&gt;...; }
// in c++03 this is one possibility
namespace std { namespace tr1 { struct hash&lt;&gt;...; } }

// my library's specialization
namespace ????_open {
struct hash&lt;mytype&gt;...;
????_close
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, one option would be using #defines to reach, open and close the adequate namespaces, or providing N files with N different specializations and conditionally #include the correct one, but that's cumbersome:</p>

<pre><code>#if defined(some_c++11_condition)
  #include ""c++11-specialization.h""
#elif defined(some_c++03_condition)
  #include ""c++03-specialization.h""
#elif (some_other_condition)
  #oh_dear_who_knows_what_this_include_will_be_like
#else_ad_nauseam
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, I'll be sticking to that strategy <em>if I'm forced to</em> but I wanted to explore some other options before. In particular, I though I could use <strong><a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/namespace_alias"" rel=""nofollow"">namespace alias</a></strong> to specialize in the correct place:</p>

<pre><code>#if defined(some_c++11_condition)
  namespace std_specialize = std;
#elif defined(some_c++03_condition)
  namespace std_specialize = std::tr1;
#...
#endif

...

namespace std_specialize {
struct hash&lt;mytype&gt;...;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately this doesn't work in any of the 3 compilers I have tried (MSVC 2008, GCC 4.7, Clang 3.0) with various errors regarding ""<code>declaration of namespace conflicts with...</code>"" in the line that reopens the namespace, which shouldn't happen because namespaces can be reopened multiple times, and if an alias is an alias and not something else then this should also apply for them. </p>

<p>I'm using the latest version of Capistrano on my rails app. Specifically, it's a Rails 4.2.0 app with the gems <code>capistrano-rails</code> and <code>capistrano-rvm</code>.</p>

<p>I have a pretty standard <code>config/unicorn.rb</code> file, which is how I start unicorn while logged into my server. I first kill the current PID with:</p>

<pre><code>kill -9 PID
</code></pre>

<p>Then I start unicorn with:</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec unicorn -D -c /path-to-my/config/unicorn.rb -E production
</code></pre>

<p>This works great, but obviously I need capistrano to do that, so I essentially have those tasks in my <code>deploy.rb</code> file, however I get that error mentioned above. Here are the two tasks I have in <code>deploy.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>namespace :deploy do
  namespace :unicorn do
    task :restart do
      on roles(:app), in: :sequence, wait: 5 do
        execute ""kill -s USR2 `cat /path-to-my/tmp/pids/app-name.pid`""
      end
    end

    desc 'Start unicorn' 
    task :start do
      on roles(:app), in: :sequence, wait: 5 do
        execute ""cd #{current_path} ; bundle exec unicorn -D -c config/unicorn.rb -E production""
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I have a similar task to restart DelayedJob, which throws the same error. The command is <code>execute ""cd #{current_path} ; RAILS_ENV=production bin/delayed_job -n2 restart""</code>. Like I mentioned above, when logged into the server with my user (same user I use for Capistrano), all of these tasks work as expected.</p>

<p>Every other <em>built-in</em> task works great with Capistrano, like precompiling assets, migrating my database, etc. It is the custom tasks I've added that are getting the error.</p>

<p>Let me know if I can add anything to help solve the problem.</p>

If so, how do I install a 64 bit version of log4net?</p>

<p>UPDATE: The main goal is to define if the given period (from <code>2013-05-06</code> to <code>2013-05-15</code> as per example 2) is rentable. The periods in database are available rental seasons, so if any of the day are not covered, the entire stay can not be rented.</p>

<p>First a brief overview of what the program intends to do: It will read a list of URLs from a text file, one at a time. For each URL, it will call a subroutine (passing the URL as a parameter) and send an HTTP HEAD request to it. Once it receives the HTTP Response headers, it will print the Server Header field from the response.</p>

<p>For each URL, it starts a new thread which calls the above subroutine.</p>

<p>The problem: The main issue is that the program crashes intermittently at times. It runs properly the other times. It appears to be unreliable code and I am sure there is a way to make it work reliably.</p>

<p>The code:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use threads;
use WWW::Mechanize;
no warnings 'uninitialized';

open(INPUT,'&lt;','urls.txt') || die(""Couldn't open the file in read mode\n"");

print ""Starting main program\n"";

my @threads;

while(my $url = &lt;INPUT&gt;)
{
    chomp $url;
    my $t = threads-&gt;new(\&amp;sub1, $url);
    push(@threads,$t);
}

foreach (@threads) {
    $_-&gt;join;
}

print ""End of main program\n"";

sub sub1 {
    my $site = shift;
    sleep 1;
    my $mech = WWW::Mechanize-&gt;new();
    $mech-&gt;agent_alias('Windows IE 6');

    # trap any error which occurs while sending an HTTP HEAD request to the site
    eval{$mech-&gt;head($site);};
    if($@)
    {
        print ""Error connecting to: "".$site.""\n"";
    }

    my $response = $mech-&gt;response();

    print $site."" =&gt; "".$response-&gt;header('Server'),""\n"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>How can I make this program work reliably and what is the reason for sporadic crashes? </p>

<p>What is the purpose of calling the join method of the thread object?</p>

<p>As per the documentation at the link below, it will wait for the thread execution to complete. Am I invoking the join method correctly?</p>

<p><a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/threads.html"">http://perldoc.perl.org/threads.html</a></p>

<p>If there are any good programming practices which I must include in the above code, please let me know. </p>

<p>Do I need to call sleep() exclusively in the code or is it not required? </p>

<p>In C, we would call Sleep() after calling CreateThread() to begin the execution of the    thread.</p>

<p>Regarding the crash: When the above Perl code crashes unexpectedly and sporadically, I get the error message: ""Perl command line interpreter has stopped working""</p>

<p>Details of the crash:</p>

<pre><code>Fault Module Name:  ntdll.dll
Exception Code: c0000008

<p>The above exception code corresponds to: STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE</p>

<p>Maybe this corresponds to invalid handle of the thread.</p>

<p>What I did is I read in the file names in the client's directory and then send the file name to the server's side by sending <code>clientSocket.send(""FILE ""+fileToTransfer + ""\n"")</code>. Then on the server's side, I use regex to get the file name out. </p>

<p>However, the client will always send the ""FILE fileName.txt"" and the file's contents together. So I suppose at the server's side, I will have to use regex to separate the file name with the file's contents. </p>

<p>So what I did at the server's side is to use <code>getFileName = re.match(r'FILE (.*)(\n)(.*)',data)</code> to get the file name and its contents separately. Unfortunately, <code>(.*)</code> does not include line breaks. </p>

<p>In that case, how do I separate the file contents with the file name? Is there a way to get the client's side to send the file name first then wait for server's side to get the file name before the file contents can be sent over? Or is there a regex which I can use so that I can separate the file name and the file contents?</p>

MyThreadPool class manages the thread counts and active threads. MyUsefulWork has square method that is accessed by the threads. The main method queues the work using ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem.</p>

<p>I'm using ManualResetEvent class methods Set() and WaitOne() to try and limit the threads to max count(MyThreadPool.MaxThreads) which is three in this example. But apparently i'm doing something wrong, given that my ActiveThreads count is going way beyond the MaxThreads upto 18(which is displayed in output as 'Increment: number' or 'Decreement: number'). Also the activethreads is incremented within a lock so that if a thread is waiting, active thread is not incremented.</p>

<p>So if anyone can point out what I am doing wrong, it would be of great help. Thank you.</p>

<p>What I am in essence doing is:
1) Pulling 5000 (and growing) device token's from an SQL database.<br>
2) Using a PHP loop, for each device token I run the above listed applePush function </p>

<p>Now this works just fine and everyone is getting the push from apple.  Now the kicker is that, my own personal iphone was the first device in my SQL database, and I would get the push notification instantly.  <strong>BUT</strong>, I just bought a new iphone and I am the last device in the database now, and I notice it takes me almost 30 minutes to get the notificaions now.  I am thinking this has to do with the physical time to make all those connections to apple, but the time it gets to the 5000th device ID, 30 minutes has lapsed.</p>

<p>This got me reading and it seems that Apple actually suggests keeping a connection open to APNS instead of opening and closing connections constantly.</p>

<p>So I write to get everyones opinion on this, am I doing this all wrong?  And if I am, how can I modify my code to get it inline with apple policy and make it faster/more efficient</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>My product is in Product table (id,1) It's also available in Deal Table (product_id,1) it has a tariff_id of 10. Because the length in the Tariff table is 0, I don't update available.</p>

<p>Product table (id,2). It's also available in Deal Table (product_id,2) it has a tariff_id of 15. Because the length in the Tariff table is 24 (>0), I need to update available to 1.</p>

<p>Product table (id,3) is in Product Table and Deal Table, but in the Deal Table it has 2 tariffs associated with it (25 and 10). Again this time because the length of one of the tariffs is 12 (>0), I need to update available to 1.</p>

<p>Exactly the same as above for Product table (id,4).</p>

<p>Product Table (id,5). Is not in the Deal Table so no update required.</p>

    3           0
    4           0
    5           0

Deal Table
------------------------------------------
   id    |    product_id   |    tariff_id
------------------------------------------
   1              1                10

   7              4                10

    10            0
    15            24
    20            0
    25            12

<p>The updated Product Table should look like this</p>

<pre><code>Product table
-------------------------
   id   |   pm_available
-------------------------
    1           0
    2           1

    4           1
    5           0
</code></pre>

<p>There are over 3000 products and 1 million deals. A product_id can appear in the Deals Table hundreds of times. So I thought if I select one product from Product Table pass that into a second query, the second query would check to see if 1) The product existed in the Deals Table. 2) If it exists what tariff is it linked to. 3) Check if the length of that tariff was greater than 0, if so, do the update.</p>

<p>I have this current script but it doesn't work correctly, I get updates to 'available' when I shouldn't. </p>

<pre><code>my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($dbiconnect,$dbiuser,$dbipass,{AutoCommit=&gt;1,RaiseError=&gt;1,PrintError=&gt;0});

<pre><code>.cred { background: {color:post};outline: 1px solid {color:border}; border: 1px outset {color:post};  bottom: 10px; left: 10px; position: fixed; padding: 2px 5px; text-transform: lowercase; font-family: bitxmap; font-size: 10px; } .cred a { text-decoration: none; } .cred:active { border: 1px inset {color:post}; }
</code></pre>

<p>but i can't find the LITERAL part that says</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""http://jubileethemes.tumblr.com""&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and it's really annoying. how am i supposed to get rid of it?</p>

<p>also, if you need the full code (i messed with it a little but this is the default), here's the link: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=NJtAbtqF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=NJtAbtqF</a></p>

<p>in winform,i can do the adjustment in the .cs like the following:</p>

<pre><code>panel6.Width
panel6.Height
panel6.Location
</code></pre>

<p>this will help me set it if my form is maximized.i do it by using some arithmetics where i get the resolution of screen and some calculation and get the value and can set it to the width, height and location.
BUT THIS IS IN WINFORM.</p>

<p>how will i tackle this issue for maximized and fullscreen in WPF? is there a way to be done through the .cs file programatically? or does WPF come with a easy built in control to tackle this issue?</p>

<p>suppose for this example im using dockpanel in the WPF.</p>

<p>Here is what I'm running:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL) saveNow:(NSString *)filePath {
    UIImage *image = [self.view getImage];
    NSData *imageData = UIImagePNGRepresentation(image);
    return [imageData writeToFile:filePath atomically:YES];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>getImage</code> is a method of a category on <code>UIView</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- (UIImage *)getImage {
    UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(self.bounds.size, NO, [[UIScreen mainScreen]scale]);
    [[self layer] renderInContext:UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()];
    UIImage *viewImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
    return viewImage;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When running this on a non-retina iPad, the creation of a <code>UIImage</code> object fills the memory with an additional 1 MB, <code>NSData</code> adds a further 4 MB, and as I run this many times, this memory is not released! On a retina iPad each call to <code>saveNow:</code> costs ~17 MB, which causes the device to run out of memory after a few runs. </p>

<p>A little extra info. I'm running this code in a loop that iterates a total of over 300 times (small changes are made to the view on each iteration and I need a screenshot of each for review purposes). If I reduce the amount of iterations so that the device does not run out of memory, I can see that the memory is released once the method that contains the loop returns. However, this is not ideal, and I would expect that taking the memory heavy code out into it's own function (<code>saveNow:</code>) should have made an improvement, but it does not. How can I force these objects to be released as soon as they are not needed instead of waiting for the parent method to return? Hopefully without having to disable ARC on the entire project.</p>

<p>Edit: I tried using <code>@autoreleasepool</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>@autoreleasepool {
    [self saveNow:filePath];
}
</code></pre>

<p>The results are better but not perfect. It releases about 4 MB of memory when the block is complete, but another 1 MB is still stuck until the container method returns. So it's an 80% improvement (yey!) but I'm aiming for 100% :) I'll read up more about <code>@autoreleasepool</code> as I have not used it before.</p>

<p>I can get the number of rows and cols using a method like this:</p>

<pre><code>int getNRows(double **data){
  int size = 0;
  while(*(data+size)){size++;}
  return size;
}

int getNCols(double **data){
  int size = 0;
  while(**(data+size)){size++;}
  return size;
}

<p>Is this ok or should I stick to the vector declaration?</p>

<p>This is the code for my ServiceTestCase:</p>

<pre><code>package com.roche.parkinsons.service;

import android.content.Intent;
import android.test.ServiceTestCase;
import android.util.Log;

import org.junit.After;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;

public class GeneralServiceTest extends ServiceTestCase&lt;GeneralService&gt; {

    /** Tag for logging */
    private final static String TAG = GeneralServiceTest.class.getName();

    public GeneralServiceTest() {
        super(GeneralService.class);
    }
//
    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        super.setUp();

        Log.d(TAG, ""Setup complete"");
    }

    @After
    public void tearDown() throws Exception {
        Log.d(TAG, ""Teardown complete"");


        super.tearDown();
    }

    @Test
    public void testOnCreate() throws Exception {
        Intent intent = new Intent(getSystemContext(), GeneralService.class);
        startService(intent);
        assertNotNull(getService());

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see it is about as simple as I can make it. It does not matter what I try, assertNotNull always fails.</p>

<p>From debugging the test, I have found that the intent created with:</p>

<pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(getSystemContext(), GeneralService.class);
</code></pre>

<p>always returns null.</p>

<p>I have tried setting the context and class like so</p>

<pre><code>    public void testOnCreate() throws Exception {
        Intent intent = new Intent(getSystemContext(), GeneralService.class);
        intent.setClass(getSystemContext(), GeneralService.class);
        startService(intent);
        assertNotNull(getService());

    }
</code></pre>

<p>But this has no effect.</p>

<p>I'm out of ideas. There are very few examples for ServiceTestCase that aren't years out of date and of those I have found (such as here: <a href=""http://alvinalexander.com/java/jwarehouse/android-examples/samples/android-9/ApiDemos/tests/src/com/example/android/apis/app/LocalServiceTest.java.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alvinalexander.com/java/jwarehouse/android-examples/samples/android-9/ApiDemos/tests/src/com/example/android/apis/app/LocalServiceTest.java.shtml</a>) I have tried to copy their code as closely as possible and have had no success.</p>

<p>I theorised that I might need to have the unit test run on a device or an emulator, but this wasn't necessary for my other unit tests that succeeded.</p>

<p>In summary, Why is my attempt to create an intent always returning null?</p>

I'm wondering if it is possible to have a class which uses a <code>template&lt;typename T&gt;</code> with functions which the 'typename T' uses by default. I'll give examples:</p>

<p>Header:</p>

{
    int width, height;

struct circleBase
{
    int radius;
    int posX, posY;
};

template&lt;typename T&gt;
class Object {
public:
    Object();
    ~Object();

    void movePos(int x, int y);

    void setPos(int x, int y);

    T&amp; returnObject() {
        return object;
    }
private:
    T object;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Source:</p>

<pre><code>includes all here
template class Object&lt;rectangleBase&gt;
template class Object&lt;circleBase&gt;

Object&lt;rectangleBase&gt;::Object() { 
    rectangleBase* newObject;
    newObject = new rectangleBase;
    object = *newObject;
}

Object&lt;circleBase&gt;::Object() {
    circleBase* newObject;
    newObject = new circleBase;
    object = *newObject;
}

void Object::movePos(int x, int y) { //here
    object.posX += x;
    object.posY += y;
}

void Object::setPos(int x, int y) { //here
    object.posX = x;
    object.posY = y;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the functions setPos and movePos, is it possible that both <code>&lt;rectangleBase&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;circleBase&gt;</code> can use the same function instead of me having to write the same code out twice because they would use the exact same code, I have show where the functions are in the code.</p>

<p>If this is not possible is there an alternative? </p>

If all the criteria are null it retrieves all suggested orders as it should, however the version numbers are all the same. Another developer is working on the UI and he's calling the above method to populate a screen with all orders so the user can select one to modify. When I get his update request though I am refusing it as the version number does not match the actual version for the object. This is how the version column looks in the mapping file:</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I downloaded nhprof to see if the sql query being generated in each case was different. Regardless of if I pass no criteria or I do provide a criteria they are exactly the same except for a where clause. When I ran each of the queries in a db editor, I got the same results I was seeing from my service. Is this some kind of strange oracle issue? If I include a where clause I get different ora_rowscn numbers, otherwise they are all the same.</p>

We have some customer sites which are experiencing transient network problems, and this is the symptomatic error message. We can duplicate it in office testing easily; Just shut down an MS SQL Server service while your delphi TADOConnection object is connected to a database on that server instance and you get this exception:</p>

<pre><code>   [DBNETLIB][ConnectionWrite (send()).]General network error. Check your network documentation.
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, catch this exception, and you know (or do you?) that this error has occurred. Except that this is an 800 KLOC+ application with over 10,000 try-except blocks around database actions, any one of which might fail with this error.  </p>

<p><code>TADOConnection</code> has some error events, none of which fire in this case.  However, the ADO Connection itself is faulted once this occurs, even if you restart the SQL database, TADOConnection.Connected remains true, but it's lying to you. It's really in a faulted state.</p>

<p><strong>So then, my question is:</strong></p>

<p><em>Can you detect this faulted state, and recover from it, in any way that is less work than going into 10,000 individual try-except blocks and setting some global ""reconnect ADO global variable""?</em></p>

<p>I am hoping there is a way to go into TADOConnection.ConnectionObject (the underlying raw OLEDB COM ADO object) and detect this fault condition exists when we are starting a new query, so that we can reset the ADOConnection and continue the next time we run a query.  Since our code is organized in a way that would allow us to detect this ""after the failure"" much more easily than it would allow us to do it the way I would do this in a 10 line demo application.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2784391/sql-server-2005-and-general-network-error"">This other SO question</a> asks why it happens,  that is <strong>not</strong> what I'm asking, please don't give me ""prevention"" answers, I know about them already, I'm looking for a recovery and detection-of-stalled-ADO-connection technique other than catching the exceptions. In fact, this is a good example of exceptions gone wrong;  ADO is a schrodingers-cat object in this failure mode.</p>

<p>I am aware of the MS Knowledgebase articles, and the various solutions floating around the internet. I'm asking about RECOVERING without losing customer data, once the error condition (which is often transient in our situations) has cleared.  That means we freeze our app, show the exception to the customer, and when the customer clicks Retry or Continue, we attempt to repair and continue. note that our existing code does a million try-except-log-and-continue code, that is going to get in our way, so I'm expecting someone to answer that an Application handler for unhandled exceptions is the best way, but sadly we can't use it. I really hope however that it is possible to detect a frozen/faulted/dead ADO connection object.</p>

<p>Here's what I have:</p>

<pre><code>try
  if fQueryEnable and ADOConnection1.Connected then begin
    qQueryTest1.Active := false;
    qQueryTest1.Active := true;
    Inc(FQryCounter);
    Label2.Caption := IntToStr(qQueryTest1.RecordCount)+' records';

  end;
except
      on E:Exception do begin
         fQueryEnable := false;
         Memo1.Lines.Add(E.ClassName+' '+E.Message);
         if E is EOleException and Pos('DBNETLIB',E.Message)&gt;0 then begin
            ADOConnectionFaulted := boolean; { Global variable. }
         end;
         raise;
      end;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with the above solution is that I need to copy and paste it about 10,000 places in my application.</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is if it's possible and/or makes any sense to <em>handle</em> messages in the same ASP.NET application.</p>

<p>The main reason I'm asking is <em>caching</em>. The process might go something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>User initiates a request from the web app.</li>
<li>Web app sends a message to a standalone app server, and logs the change in a local database.</li>
<li>On future page requests from the same user, the web app is aware of the change and lists it in a ""pending"" status.</li>
<li>A bunch of stuff happens on the back-end and eventually the requests gets approved or rejected. An event is published referencing the original request.</li>
<li>At this point, the web app <em>should</em> start displaying the most recent information.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, in a real web app, it's almost a sure thing that this pending request is going to be cached, quite possibly for a long period of time, because otherwise the app has to query the database for pending changes <em>every time</em> the user asks for the current info.</p>

<p>So when the request finally completes on the back-end - which might take a minute or a day - the web app needs, at a minimum, to invalidate this cache entry and do another DB lookup.</p>

<p>Now I realize that this can be managed with <code>SqlDependency</code> objects and so on, but let's assume that they aren't available - perhaps it's not a SQL Server back-end or perhaps the current-info query goes to a web service, whatever. The question is, how does the web app become aware of the change in status?</p>

<p>If it <em>is</em> possible to handle NServiceBus messages in an ASP.NET application, what is the context of the handler? In other words, the IoC container is going to have to inject a bunch of dependencies, but what is their scope? Does this all execute in the context of an HTTP request? Or does everything need to be static/singleton for the message handler?</p>

<p>Is there a better/recommended approach to this type of problem?</p>

  { url: 'http://www.example.com/2' },
  ...
  { url: 'http://www.example.com/N' },

<p>Currently I'm using <a href=""https://github.com/caolan/async"" rel=""nofollow"">async.each</a>, which works nicely:</p>

<pre><code>async.each(

      }
    }),
  },
  function(err) { // 3rd param is the function to call when everything's done
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error in the final async callback:', err);
    }
  }
);
</code></pre>

<p>The only problem is that the site's server some times (understandably) responds with a <em>403</em> (<em>forbidden</em>) status code, due to an excess of requests from the same IP in the time unit...</p>

<p>I see <code>async</code> provides a <code>whilst()</code> method, too, whose example is:</p>

<pre><code>var count = 0;
async.whilst(
  function () { return count &lt; 5; },
  function (callback) {
    count++;
    setTimeout(callback, 1000);
  },
  function (err) {
    // 5 seconds have passed
  }
);
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't see how to use it to use it with a list, or how to use it combined with <code>async.each</code>... :-(</p>

<p>So the answer is: <em>How do I limit (throttle) a list of async requests in node.js?</em></p>

<p><em>P.S.:</em> To be clearer, I don't want (if possible) to <em>queue</em> the requests, since a request could possibly take a long time to complete...: I just want the requests to be <em>initiated</em> at defined temporal intervals (say 5 ~ 10 seconds between each request...).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>After alireza david comment, I did try using async.eachLimit, which looked very promising, to me... This is an example of it's usage, on the module github <a href=""https://github.com/caolan/async/blob/master/lib/async.js"" rel=""nofollow"">site</a>:</p>

<pre><code>async.eachLimit(
    obj.files,
    limit
    function (file, complete) {
      complete();
    },
    function (err) {
    }
);
</code></pre>

<p>But the limit usage is not documented, and it's not clear to me...

It has been a really positive experience and I want to push it as much as I can but I have now hit a problem when it comes to internationalization. What I want to do is make sure that text returned is correct and don't contain strings like 'undefined' or that I don't send the substitutions in the wrong order.</p>

<p>Chrome extensions have access to the method <code>chrome.i18n.getMessage()</code>, but when running my tests in QUnit against the code, the <code>chrome.i18n</code> is <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>The way I see it, I have three options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mock/replicate the function</li>
<li>Include the tests as part of the extension and run
them in the context of an extension</li>
<li>Don't test these parts</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 3 is the one I really want to avoid as I can see the 'application' growing to be quite large.</p>

<p>Option 2 is acceptable, but I don't want to ship the tests as part of the extension. I'm sure that I can figure out a way to differentiate between the development and production version, but it will require some work.</p>

<p>Option 1 would be the best route for me, but I can't find a suitable way to handle <a href=""https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/i18n.html#method-getMessage"" rel=""nofollow"">substitutions</a> like the Chrome does. Are there any JavaScript tools or regular expressions that would be able to at least allow me to mock this functionality?</p>

<p>But to do this, I need to find out how much text will actually fit on the page.</p>

<p>[NSString sizeWithFont: ...] Is not enough, it will just tell me if the text fits in the rectangle or not, if its does not, it will silently truncate the string, but it won't tell me where it truncated!</p>

<p>I need to know the first word that does not fit on the page, so I can split the string and draw that part of it on the next page. (and repeat)</p>

<p>Any ideas how to solve this?</p>

<p>Only idea I have myself so far is to repeatedly call sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize: around the point in the string where I'm guessing the page break will be, and analyse the resulting rect, but it feels cumbersome and slow and I feel I might have additional problems getting it 100% accurate... (because of descenders, and whatnot.)</p>

<p>ofc, it has to be available in the public iOS SDK</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

<p>Phew, that was some hairy documentation. Here is my finished function as an example, maybe it will help someone, since there isn't much iphone-specific core text examples out there.</p>

<pre><code>+ (NSArray*) findPageSplits:(NSString*)string size:(CGSize)size font:(UIFont*)font;
{
  NSMutableArray* result = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:32];
  CTFontRef fnt = CTFontCreateWithName((CFStringRef)font.fontName, font.pointSize,NULL);
  CFAttributedStringRef str = CFAttributedStringCreate(kCFAllocatorDefault, 
                                                       (CFStringRef)string, 
                                                       (CFDictionaryRef)[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:(id)fnt,kCTFontAttributeName,nil]);
  CTFramesetterRef fs = CTFramesetterCreateWithAttributedString(str);
  CFRange r = {0,0};
  CFRange res = {0,0};
  NSInteger str_len = [string length];
  do {
    CTFramesetterSuggestFrameSizeWithConstraints(fs,r, NULL, size, &amp;res);
    r.location += res.length;
    [result addObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:res.length]];
  } while(r.location &lt; str_len);
//  NSLog(@""%@"",result);
  CFRelease(fs);
  CFRelease(str);
  CFRelease(fnt);
  return result;
}  
</code></pre>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong></p>

<p>You can not use the returned range or size with any UIKit classes or string drawing functions! You must only use it with Core Text, for example creating a CTFrame and drawing that.
Subtle differences in things like kerning makes it impossible to combine Core Text functions with UIKit. </p>

<p>Also, note that the returned size has been found to be buggy.</p>

<p>Is it possible to exclude the Age variable when importing the above CSV?  My current approach is to simply use the <code>cut</code> shell command.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>iluvcapra has a great answer for small CSVs.  However, for very large CSVs this approach is inefficient.  For example, imagine that the above CSV was very large, 30Gb lets say.  Loading all that Age data only to immediately remove is a waste of time.  With this in mind, is there a more efficient way to load subsets of columns into sqlite databases? </p>

<p>I suspect that the best option is to use the shell command <code>cut</code> to cull out unnecessary columns.  Is that intuition correct?  Is it common to use shell commands to pre-process CSV files into more sqlite friendly versions?  </p>

However, when I add it to the code, the object isn't removed. Here is my code for the loop that generates my object:</p>

<pre><code>for i = 0; i&lt;1000; ++i {
        var randomNumber = CGFloat(arc4random_uniform(3000)) * 200
        bubbleDuplicate.position = (CGPointMake(randomNumber, 400))

        bubbleDuplicate.physicsBody?.categoryBitMask = bubbleCategory
        bubbleDuplicate.physicsBody?.collisionBitMask = 0
        bubbleDuplicate.physicsBody?.contactTestBitMask = 0

        addChild(bubbleDuplicate)

        func BubbleContact(){
            bubbleDuplicate.removeFromParent()
            bubble.removeFromParent()
            bubbleDuplicate.setScale(0)
            bubble.setScale(0)

        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>and here's my code for the collision that is supposed to remove my object:</p>

<pre><code>func didBeginContact(contact: SKPhysicsContact) {
    let collision:UInt32 = (contact.bodyA.categoryBitMask | contact.bodyB.categoryBitMask)

    if collision == (playerCategory | crateCategory) {

    }
    if collision == (playerCategory | bubbleCategory) {

        bubbleDuplicate.removeFromParent()
        bubble.removeAllActions()

        bubble.removeFromParent()
        bubbleDuplicate.removeFromParent()

}
</code></pre>

<p>How can I fix my code?</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks to @NikitaLeonov's answer, my bubble sprite now functions the way it's supposed to. However, I'm trying to apply the same functionality to another sprite node and simply duplicating his code will not produce the same effect. What do I do? Here's the new code:</p>

<pre><code>if (contact.bodyA.categoryBitMask == bubbleCategory) {

        //Other remove routine

I have create a bunch of flow-chart diagrams on first canvas-1 programmatically by javascript and by using addflow (Lassange) HTML5 controls. Now I have another canvas-2 at its side on which I want the user to pick any given UI-control (from canvas-1) and drag-and-drop the same on canvas-2. BUT I am unable to achieve this.</p>

<p>I tried assigning draggable property to the programmatically created ui-control (canvas-1) and also made the canvas-1 draggable etc but I think this approach will not work. The UI-control does get dragged but ONLY within the boundaries of canvas-1. Now how do I ensure that an user can be able to do this... what should be my javascript coding approach at the html-page-behind?.</p>

<p>EDIT: Somebody who is acquainted with Lassalle's technologies -- 'AddFlow' HTML5 jscript component can be of more help here because I am using that HTML5 control to create two canvas and for filling the set of UI-controls as a 'pallet' into the canvas-1.

I would like to increase this to around 10 fps.

<p>The jQuery dialog close function doesn't do anything special:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#divProcessModal"").dialog(
        {
            height: 300,
            width: 400,

<p>All I do is click the <code>Close without processing</code> button.<br>
Things I've tried include registering the script on the server side, and setting the mastertable as a global variable, but without success.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I figured out what the cause is. The content of the jquery dialog is another page</p>

<pre><code>$(""#divProcessModal"").load(""/ProcessRequests.aspx?requestList=""+requestList);
</code></pre>

<p>This page has its own form, code-behind and all that, and that seems to cause the problem. I guess I can move all the functionality in <code>ProcessRequests.aspx</code> to the current aspx page, but if anyone can explain what is happening and why my initial approach doesn't work, I would appreciate it.</p>

"27765294","1","","","2015-01-04 12:04:52","","0","81","<p>My (hopefully last) question about timed events and threading in Java. I have a Server application, which sends information to all clients about current Server time. I added a possiblity for a client to change Server time. However, the way it's currently implemented, every Client connection runs on a separate thread. And each of those threads has its own ClockTask instance. So even if time is modified by a client, it will only be modified in the ClockTask instance of this particular thread. Any other clients will still have their own, old time. My code:</p>

<p>Server - every time an incoming Client connects, a new thread is started.</p>

<pre><code>public class Server {



 public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        ServerSocket serverSocket = null;

        boolean listeningSocket = true;

        try {
            serverSocket = new ServerSocket(11111);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println(""Could not listen on port: 11111"");
        }


        while(listeningSocket){
            System.out.println(""Waiting for a client to connect..."");
            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
            System.out.println(""Client connected!"");
            ConnectThread ct = new ConnectThread(clientSocket);     

            ct.start();

        }
        System.out.println(""closed"");
        serverSocket.close();       
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>ConnectThread - every connect thread has its own ClockTask (which is in fact a timer, updating time every second) :</p>

<pre><code>public class ConnectThread extends Thread{

public static final int INTERVAL = 1000;

static ClockTask ctask;


private Socket socket = null;
public ConnectThread(Socket socket) {
   super(""ConnectThread"");

    if(this.ctask == null)

public void run(){
    ObjectOutputStream serverOutputStream = null;
    ObjectInputStream serverInputStream = null;
    try {           
        serverOutputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());          
        serverInputStream = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream());


        Timer timer = new Timer();

<p>Clock task holds the time information:</p>

<pre><code>public class ClockTask extends TimerTask {

private Calendar calendar;
private String time;

public String getTime() {
    return time;
}


public void setTime(String time) {
    this.time = time;
}


public ClockTask()
{
    this.calendar = Calendar.getInstance(new Locale(""us"", ""US""));

}


@Override
public void run() {

    calendar.add(Calendar.SECOND, 1);
    DateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(""HH:mm:ss"");                   
    this.time = dateFormat.format(calendar.getTime());
    //System.out.println(time);
}


public void setCalendarTime(String newTime)
{
    DateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(""HH:mm:ss"");   
    try {
        Date t = dateFormat.parse(newTime);
        calendar.setTime(t);

    } catch (ParseException e) {
        // TODO Auto-generated catch block
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}



}
</code></pre>

<p>And now, the first obvious method that came to my mind, would be to declare the ClockTask in the Server class, and then pass the object reference to any new ConnectThread, then modify it. But that didn't work, I got lots of data reading errors, also a problem with this is that it happens in static main method, so I can only access it in a static way. The only thing I know, is that it can't be created in every new ConnectThread instance. It has to be one object, existing somewhere outside. Any ideas?</p>

Client:</p>

<pre><code>public class Client {

private static final String REQUEST_TIME_CHANGE = ""ok"";

Das heißt ich erstelle mir auf einen ganz normalen Account auf meiner Webseite, mit dem ich Zugriff auf die Webseite habe. Gleichzeitig möchte ich aber mit diesem Login auch automatisch bei Facebook eingeloggt sein. Dafür muss ich ja zunächst eine Facebook App erstellen und diese mit meinen Facebook Account verknüfpen. Das habe ich bereits getan. </p>

<p>Nur wie kann ich nun statt den Facebook Button zum Login mich mit einen normalen User Account einloggen, der mich dann automatisch bei Facebook einloggt?</p>

<p>Für einige, die diese Frage nicht direkt verstehen: <a href=""https://hootsuite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">zu Hootsuite</a></p>

<p>Bei Hootsuite kann ich einen normalen Free Hootsuite Account anlegen (separater Login als Facebook). Dann verknüpfe ich meinen Facebook Account und meine Facebook-Fan-Pages mit der Hootsuite Facebook App. Das Ganze geschieht einmalig. Wann immer ich mich nun bei Hootsuite über den normalen Account einlogge bin ich auch schon direkt bei Facebook etc. eingeloggt und kann auf alles zugreifen.</p>

<p>Ich weiß das Ganze soll irgendetwas mit den Access Tokens zu tun haben. Leider finde ich im Internet einfach kein Tutorial, mit dem ich einen solchen Fall programmieren kann.</p>

<p>Mein bisherige Code kann bisher nur den normalen Facebook Login: </p>

<pre><code>    &lt;div id=""fb-root""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
function checkLoginState() {
    FB.getLoginStatus(function(response) {
      statusChangeCallback(response);
    });
  }

  // This is called with the results from from FB.getLoginStatus().
  function statusChangeCallback(response) {
    console.log('statusChangeCallback');
    console.log(response);
    // The response object is returned with a status field that lets the
    // app know the current login status of the person.
    // Full docs on the response object can be found in the documentation
    // for FB.getLoginStatus().
    if (response.status === 'connected') {
      // Logged into your app and Facebook.
        document.getElementById('status').innerHTML = 'Verbunden';
    } else if (response.status === 'not_authorized') {
      // The person is logged into Facebook, but not your app.
      document.getElementById('status').innerHTML = 'Please log ' +
        'into this app.';
    } else {
      // The person is not logged into Facebook, so we're not sure if
      // they are logged into this app or not.
      document.getElementById('status').innerHTML = 'Please log ' +
        'into Facebook.';
    }
  }

  window.fbAsyncInit = function() {
    FB.init({
      appId      : 'AppID',
      xfbml      : true,
      status     : true,

Each app has a copy of the app dll in its own bin dir, plus some open source third party libraries (the bin folder is approx 15mb on disk)
The app is by me so i can rebuild signed and put in a GAC so all sites get from there.
My question is: ""would be good in terms of memory consumption have just one copy of dll in gac instead of 80?"" ""does this may improve the overall performance and memory usage, beside tha fat that i can remove 15*80Mb disk space usage?""

<p>When moving to OData v<strong>4</strong> and upon doing the <code>modelBulder.GetEdmModel()</code> step we get an InvalidOperationException ""The complex type 'Foo' refers to the entity 'Bar' through the property 'Bar'.""</p>

<p>I look at the spec and see a thing called an ""abstract entity type"" that is a type that holds entity types. I don't see that in the WebApi OData code so I <em>hope</em> that all I have to do is declare an <code>EntityType</code> that has no key and I get one. </p>

<p>No dice. Making my <code>Foo</code> type an <code>EntityType</code> (doing <code>modelBuilder.AddEntityType(typeof(Foo))</code> instead of <code>modelBuilder.AddComplexType(typeof(Foo))</code>) gives an InvalidOperationException ""The entity 'Foo' does not have a key defined"".</p>

<p>Is there a entity-data-model clean way to use a <code>ComplexType</code> or an <code>EntityType</code>?</p>

<p>One clean but painful solution would be to make even more classes that are essentially my entities renamed and added to the model as <code>ComplexType</code> so that I can return the data as a complex type (I would include casting operators from the entity types to the matching complex types so they could be used interchangeably in client code). Obviously, I don't want to go through this pain for something that worked fine before upgrading to OData v4.</p>

<p>A much easier but non-clean way (and I have done this and it works) involves inserting an unused key into each now <code>EntityType</code> that used to be a <code>ComplexType</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Gets or sets the not used ""key"" property
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;remarks&gt;
/// OData v4 seems to have broken the ability of a complex type to hold 
/// an entity type. In the spec, there is the notion of an abstract 
/// entity type - an entity type that does not have a key. But, it

I'm currently doing this in the @PostConstruct method of the @Controller class. But this registers the service before it's actually ready to receive requests, because the web container isn't yet listening for web requests. I'd prefer to register the service after the web container has finished all of its initialization and is listening for requests.</p>

<p>I may be ""prematurely optimizing"". The eventual full deployment environment will need to load-balance a set of replicas of each service, and the load balancer will have to take care of determining actual service availability and current load for each instance.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: additional clarification.</p>

<p>I want to register the service with an <em>external registry</em> (specifically, in this case, a Zookeeper instance.) I would prefer that the service not be added to the registry until the application server has <em>finished</em> initializing and is ""open for business.""

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zkKrv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>And I'm using MySQL to insert/update/create info however the time it takes to execute queries is slow example:</p>

<p>First when a user runs my app it verifies they can use it by retrieving all IPs from the db with </p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>SELECT IP FROM user_info
</code></pre>

<p>Then using a while loop if the IP is in the db do another query:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>""SELECT Valid FROM user_info WHERE IP='"".$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'].""'""""
</code></pre>

<p>If Valid is 1 then they can use it otherwise they can't however if their IP is not found in the db it creates a new entry for them using</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>""INSERT INTO user_info (IP,First) VALUES ('"".$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'].""','"".date(""Y/m/d"") .""')"")""
</code></pre>

<p>Now this first script has finished it accesses another - this one was supposed to update the db every minute however i don't think i can accomplish that now ; the update query is this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>""UPDATE user_info SET Name='"".$Name.""', Status='"".$Status.""', Last='"".$Last.""', Address='"".$Address.""' WHERE IP='"".$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'].""'"")""
</code></pre>

<p>All together it takes average <strong>2.2 seconds and there's only 1 row in the table atm</strong></p>

<p>My question is how do i speed up mysql queries? I've read about indexes and how they can help improve performance but i do not fully understand how to use them. Any light shed on this topic would help.</p>

<p>Strangely enough - when using kinect studio the issue is not only non existent but when the studio runs even if not connected to the kinect, the problem is fixed for the example application as well. </p>

How can I upload these sites (via FTP/SSH) as a user (root) that is the same as php, so that php can create files in all folders it needs to write to?</p>

<p>I am using:
Ubuntu 12.04;
Python 3.4.1;
Pycharm 3.4.1</p>

<p>So, I run the following code in pyCharm using 3.4.1 interpreter and plot doesn't appear:</p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as p 
p.plot(range(20), range(20))
p.show()
</code></pre>

<p>Then I thought it could be something with pycharm, therefore I have tried the same in the terminal. However, plot didn't appear too.</p>

<p>However, since Ubuntu is with built-in Python 2.7, I have tried the same on terminal, then on pycharm and plot did appear. </p>

<p>I have found out that backend in matplotlibrc file should be changed. I googled, that qt4agg backend should be used. After changing it and trying to import matplotlib.pyplot I get the following</p>

<pre><code>%post_id%-%post_name%
</code></pre>

<p>But in <code>single.php</code> I want to put another link to page itself but with different query string. When it is clicked the permalink structure may look  like:</p>

<pre><code>%mystring%-%post_id%-%post_name%
</code></pre>

<p>I want to get the value from <code>$_GET['action']</code>, so: </p>

<pre><code>$_GET['action'] = %mystring%
</code></pre>

<p>my plan is to interpret it like:</p>

<pre><code>if('xx' == $_GET['action']){
   //do xx stuff
} else if ('yy'==$_GET['action']){
   //do yy stuff
} else {
   //show the single post as a single.php always shows
}
</code></pre>

<p>that means, I want to parse the <code>$_GET['action']</code> optionally. If I do not parse it even if it is available in query string, I want the page to be rendered correctly.</p>

<p>So to get this done, where should I actually work? Also how do I form the link for <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag? Usually we make link this way:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""'.the_permalink().'""&gt;TEXT&lt;/a&gt;

<p>but you already know, I need to add some text before the original permalink of post.</p>

<p>Here's the parent class:</p>

<pre><code>class Product {
    protected $productid;
    protected $type;

    public function __construct( $productid ) {
        $this-&gt;productid = $productid;
        // Performs a lookup in the database and then populates the $type property
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>.. and here are the children:</p>

<pre><code>class Toothbrush extends Product {
    public function getPrice() {
        return 5; // returning an integer for simplicity; there's a calculation going on here
    }
}

class Chainsaw extends Product {
    public function getPrice() {
        return 1000; // in USD
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to iterate through a list of <code>$productid</code>'s and get the corresponding price of the items regardless of whether they are <code>chainsaw</code>'s or <code>toothbrush</code>es.</p>

<h2>The problem (or is it?)</h2>

<p>Now I've heard over and over again that <strong>a parent class should NOT rely on the child class</strong> to implement functionality (yes I read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12934744/calling-a-child-method-from-the-parent-class-in-php"">this question</a>, along with many others).</p>

<p>Which is why I'm led to think that the solution I'm currently using (below) isn't optimal:</p>

<pre><code>class Product {
...
    public function getPrice() {
        switch($this-&gt;type) {
            case 'toothbrush':
                $theproduct=new Toothbrush($this-&gt;productid);
                return $theproduct-&gt;getPrice();
                break;
            case 'chainsaw':
                $theproduct=new Chainsaw($this-&gt;productid);
                return $theproduct-&gt;getPrice();
                break;
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I can obviously sense that something is remiss here (I shudder to think of what would happen when I get 30 different product types). I've read about abstraction, interfaces, and inheritance and can't figure out which one would work in this scenario.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>Seeing alot of answers, but none that've nailed it just yet. Here is the main point:
<strong>How do I call a child method if have only a productid?</strong> (In the above scenario, the <code>Product</code> class retrieves the type from the database in the constructor and populates the <code>$type</code> property accordingly.</p>

<p>The login is done through the JAVASCRIPT Api. So I have this simple HTML page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

&lt;meta charset=""utf-8"" /&gt;

&lt;script src=""cordova.js"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

&lt;div id=""fb-root""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
 $(document).on('click', '#login', function(){
   facebookConnectPlugin.login([""email,user_birthday,publish_actions""], function(response) {
      if(response.authResponse) {
         alert(response.authResponse.userID);
      }
   });
 });
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;img id=""login"" src=""images/login.png"" alt="""" /&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The above code works well when the user hasn't authenticated the app before. So when a user clicks the login button and the user accepts the login, the user id is returned successfully and the session will stick well when the use closes and reopens the app.</p>

<p>The problem lies when the user uninstalls the app and reinstalls again. When they click the login button, the login dialog will open quickly and close again as the user is already authenticated in the app. The user id and access token should return in the response like the regular javascript api of Facebook. Instead the second function which is failure will be returned with the following error:</p>

<pre><code>session was closed and was not closed normally
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to logout the user but I got the following error:<code>there is no session initiated...</code></p>

<p>I have added the following to the config.xml file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;gap:plugin name=""com.phonegap.plugins.facebookconnect"" version=""0.9.0""&gt;
   &lt;param name=""APP_ID"" value=""xxxxxx"" /&gt;
   &lt;param name=""APP_NAME"" value=""App Name"" /&gt;
&lt;/gap:plugin&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Currently the Facebook app has only Website as platform. Do I need to add Android as platform while I'm using the javascript API for authentication?</p>

<p>Is there any solution for this?</p>

<p>The Problem is that the request is started BEFORE the window is repainted. I have a request delay of about one second and THEN the loading animation is displayed. This animation should be displayed before the request is started. </p>

<p>What I tried so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thread.sleep() in front of the Wolfram Query. But that would block the repaint too?! - same unwanted behavior</li>
<li>Put the request into a runnable - same unwanted behavior</li>
<li>Put the request into a class extended by Thread - same unwanted behavior</li>
<li>Combine both with Thread.sleep() - same unwanted behavior</li>
</ul>

"29956219","1","29980614","","2015-04-29 23:11:41","","1","28","<p>So far we have been storing information of changes as following.
Imagine having a changeset table structure of something that gets changed that is called object. The object is connected to say a foreign element by a foreign key. The object gets created like this</p>

<pre><code>changesetId (Timestamp) | objectId | foreignKey | name (String) | description (String)
2015-04-29 23:28:52     | 2        |   123      |  none         | none
</code></pre>

<p>Now we change the name, the table will look like that after the name change</p>

<pre><code>changesetId (Timestamp) | objectId | foreignKey | name (String) | description (String)
2015-04-29 23:28:52     | 2        |   123      |  none         | none
2015-04-29 23:30:01     | 2        |   null     |  foo          | null
</code></pre>

<p>This structure is exactly the minimum. It contains exactly the change we did. But to create the current version of the object, we have to add up the changes to actually get the final version. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>    changesetId (Timestamp) | objectId | foreignKey | name (String) | description (String)
    2015-04-29 23:28:52     | 2        |   123      |  none         | none
    2015-04-29 23:30:01     | 2        |   null     |  foo          | null
   *2015-04-29 23:30:01     | 2        |   123      |  foo          | none
</code></pre>

<p>the * marking the final version, which does not exist in the DB.</p>

<p>So if we only store exactly the changes, we have more work to do. Especially, when coming from a foreign object <code>f</code>. If I have a number of objects <code>f</code> and I want to get all changes to the object from our table, I have to create a bit of an ugly SQL. This obviously gets worse, the more foreign objects you have.</p>

<p>Basically I have to do:</p>

<pre><code>Select all F that I want and 
Select all objects WHERE foreignKey = foreignId
OR Select all objects that have objectId in (Select all objects that have foreignKey = foreignId)
</code></pre>

<p>e.g. I have to select the objects that have foreignKey 123 or elements that have foreignKey null but there exists an entry with same objectId with foreignKey 123.</p>

<p>The more dependencies, the uglier this SQL gets obviously.</p>

<p>Did I make myself clear?</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be much easier to keep always all fields in all versions</p>

<p>e.g. a simple name change gets:</p>

<p>Example for sensor1.dat</p>

<pre><code>x1,x2,x3
1,2,3
4,5,6
7,8,9
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to loop all over the timefolders and load in for every timestep the last row of the sensor files</p>

<p>Results could be a nested list:
Outer list contains the time data - Inner List for every time data all sensor_data, which means here: Outer List 100 rows, inner list 11 rows for each outer row.</p>

<p>Therefore I tried following:</p>

<pre><code>def getData():
for TIME in TIMES:   
    cd_string = TIME
    cd_string = string.replace(cd_string,'\n','') 
    os.chdir(cd_string)

    print(TIME)
    i_sensors=11
    data=[]
    for i in xrange(1,i_sensors+1):
        #print i
        sensor_string='../../sets/'+cd_string+'/w_z_sensor_'+str(i)+'_U.dat'
        data_input = np.genfromtxt(sensor_string, delimiter="","" , skip_header=1)
        data.append(data_input[-1,:])  

    os.chdir('../') 
    return data



######MAIN####
TIMES = os.popen(""ls -d 0.31* "").readlines()

zw=[[]] #*len(TIMES)

for i in xrange(0,len(TIMES)):
   zw[i].append(getData())
</code></pre>

<p>The function getData works fine and I get all the data I need for the sensor files for each time step,</p>

<p>The problem is the main part. Here I amt trying to append the sensor data for every time folder. This does not work. With the uncommented z=[[]]*len(TIMES) it just only copy the data in 100 rows</p>

<p>Where is my problem?</p>

<p>Any advice and thanks in advance?</p>

<p>The validation works fine, but the response I get back in fiddler when I submit a string that fails validation is - </p>

<pre><code>&lt;Error&gt;
   &lt;Message&gt;The request is invalid.&lt;/Message&gt;

<p>x005B and x005D are hex code for  <a href=""http://graphemica.com/%5B"" rel=""nofollow""><code>[ ]</code></a> and 1 is the array position.</p>

<p>If I change the header to <code>Accept: application/json</code> I get <code>[1]</code> as expected.</p>

Added requested code</p>

The problem I face is that the XML data format can be divided based on the independent nodes which can be created as separate tables in the DB. However if the number of child nodes in the independent nodes increases, there will be an increase in the number of columns in the table. I found that there are 500-600 columns on an avg for a table which might seriously impact the query performance.
The data rows need to be frequently updated &amp; queried for reading. Performance is the sole criteria for this change keeping the CPU load to minimum for that process.
Please share an idea to get around this problem. Ideas for converting the XML data to SQLite DB format are most welcome.</p>

<p>I know how to send an HttpWebRequest as POST. </p>

<p>I am fairly sure I need to send the webrequest to: ""https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/update.json"" (not totally clear)</p>

<p>I know there are many libraries out there that all you have to do is pass your consumer keys and token keys. However, I need to create some very short code, in a function, that simple posts a hard coded string to Twitter. When I get this working that hard coded string will be replaced by variable.</p>

<p>I've no need to status updates or any kind of information from Twitter. Just POST ""Hello World!"" to start with, and I can go from there.</p>

<p>I am forced to use VB.NET. I am using Visual Studio Web Developer 2010.</p>

<p>Now, that all said, I have looked at Nikolas Tarzia's VB.NET port of C-Sharp code here: 
<a href=""http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/vbnet/oAuth.vb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/vbnet/oAuth.vb</a></p>

<p>I can see roughly what the functions do by looking at them, but have no idea which ones I need to call to create a webresponse and send to Twitter! Also I believe this code contains more than I need. If I just want to create a POST, then likely I only need to hash function and the nonce function and my tokens and keys. Is that right? If so, could someone please help me narrow this down? In the process helping me understand a bit better what properly formed webrequest needs to be sent to Twitter to make a quick Tweet?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Will</p>

<p>PS - I finally put together some code, based on looking at OAuth documentation, a neat little code example on using POST request in VB, and the Twitter Developer area OAuth tool to generate some Base String for the request. Unfortunately while it compiles and runs okay, I am not getting a tweet. Could someone have a look at the code and see if they can spot any glaring issues? Obviously I replaced my tokens and consumer keys with ""xxxxx"". All I want for Christmas is to run this code and make a quick Tweet on my Twitter account! ;)</p>

    data=a0280</p>

<pre><code>A       2   4   8   16  32  64  128 256 512 1024    2048    4096    8192

<p>Now I don't know what to do to continue this.
This is what I need to do (but dont know how to).</p>

<p>Now my client asks for 3 stuff.
Example</p>

<pre><code> declared client variables 1,2,3 as string...

 Enter Anything: dgasggfds 
 //dgasggfds is now stored to cvariable1
 Enter Anything again: zxcasd
 //zxcasd is now stored to cvariable2
 Enter Anything again again: qwert
 //qwer is now stored to cvariable3
</code></pre>

<p>Now the client should send each of this variable to the server.
The server will then also use those variables and execute its codes.</p>

<p>So now on the server</p>

<pre><code> cvariable1 is now svariable1 on the server.
 cvariable2 is now svariable2 on the server.
 cvariable3 is now svariable3 on the server.
</code></pre>

<p>Once all the variable is there, it will execute a code.</p>

<p>Please advice. Thanks.</p>

<p>--edit--</p>

<p>I tried using send() recv() it works but I can only send 1 variable.
and I dont know how to set the recv data into a variable on the server.</p>

<p>--edit--</p>

<p>I kinda get how to save the recv data into a variable.
But still don't know how to do it with the multiple data.</p>

<p>Also the 3 variables must always be together. they cant be separated.
The servers code needs those 3 variables/data to execute the cmds properly.</p>

<p>--edit--</p>

<p>Does this make any sense?</p>

<pre><code>string* packet = new string[3];
packet[0] = 'var1';
packet[1] = 'var2';
packet[2] = 'var3';

//send request
if (send(sock, packet.c_str(), packet.length(), 0) != request.length())
    die_with_wserror(""send() sent a different number of bytes than expected"");
</code></pre>

<p>Its giving me some error though. packet:expression must have class type.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do now is send it in an array, and break down the array once on the server, is this logic okay?</p>

<p>The problem is in for(dummy...) loop - it's just simulation of service delay - time needed to parse incoming messages, write something to DB and so on. When delay is small code works fine, all of 10000 messages come to server (100 client threads X 100 messages from each client) but when dummy loop makes over 3.000.000 iterations some of client threads fail to connect to server. One more strange thing here is ignoring infinite timeout property by client socket. I mean socket.connect(InetAddress,timeout) with timeout equal to zero means infinite timeout - in other words service delay doesn't make sense  at least I expect such behavior. </p>

<p>For processing I've seen very basic examples and was wondering if what would be easier/better: to do a direct graph using the map function or to setup a cgraph and cdata arrays (saw in another example). Lastly while using a create writer or filewriter for saving data, is there a way to have new files being created rather than overwrtiring or appending data? Could I use an if statement to get user input text to type in the filename to avoid an overwrite? </p>

<p>Now, the problem is Two way binding stop working, when I change Cell Style and Element Style at runtime for the first column which is a DataGridCheckBoxColumn.</p>

<p>Doesn't matter where I change it, while AutoGeneratingColumn or after AutoGeneratedColumns.</p>

<p>And if I don't set these styles, and everything works fine.</p>

<p>Below is the code sample that I use to change Cell Style and Element Style</p>

<p><strong>C#:</strong></p>

<pre><code>        DataGridCheckBoxColumn checkBoxColumn = (DataGridCheckBoxColumn)dtGrid.Columns[0];
        // Cell Element Style
        Style elemStyle = new Style(typeof(CheckBox));
        Setter setterHAlign = new Setter(CheckBox.HorizontalAlignmentProperty, HorizontalAlignment.Center);
        Setter setterVAlign = new Setter(CheckBox.VerticalAlignmentProperty, VerticalAlignment.Center);
        elemStyle.Setters.Add(setterHAlign);
        elemStyle.Setters.Add(setterVAlign);

        //// Cell Style
        Style cellStyle = new Style(typeof(DataGridCell));

        // Triggers
        Setter setterForeground = new Setter(DataGridCell.ForegroundProperty, Brushes.White);
        Setter setterBackground = new Setter(DataGridCell.BackgroundProperty, Brushes.Gray);
        Setter setterBorderBrush = new Setter(DataGridCell.BorderBrushProperty, Brushes.Red);
        Setter setterBorderThickness = new Setter(DataGridCell.BorderThicknessProperty, new Thickness(0));

        Trigger trigger = new Trigger()
        {
            Property = DataGridCell.IsSelectedProperty,
            Value = true,
            Setters = { setterForeground, setterBackground, setterBorderBrush, setterBorderThickness },
        };

        cellStyle.Triggers.Add(trigger);

        checkBoxColumn.CellStyle = cellStyle;
        checkBoxColumn.ElementStyle = elemStyle;
</code></pre>

<p>I know the new styles override the auto generated styles and that's what causes the two way binding to fail. If this is (and probably is) the wrong way of doing this, some tips, samples and explanation would be a great help.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> the Columns must be auto generated since the structure of the DataTable is not known except first few column.</p>

"1967852","1","1967933","","2009-12-28 03:30:39","","5","625","<p>A question yesterday about doubled-checked locking started a chain of thoughts that left me unsure about a simple situation. In the following code, is it possible to hit the <code>printf</code> of “No longer in sync”?  In this simple example, the values would likely be on the same cache line, so I think it would be less likely (assuming the possibility is > 0% to begin with).  </p>

<p>If the answer is, “No, it is not possible.”, then my follow-up question is, rather predictably:  why not?  Until I got my thoughts tangled and wrapped around the multi-threading axel yesterday, I assumed that the code would be safe. But now I am wondering what prevents a stale read from the cache for one of the variables <code>pa</code> or <code>pb</code>.  And would it matter if <code>pa, pb</code> pointed to simple global integer variables rather than malloc’d memory?  Does the WaitForSingleObject call provide a memory barrier?  Or should the pointers be declared volatile? So many questions, so few sentences.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:  I finally located information that does specifically say that functions that signal synchronization objects do use <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686355.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">memory barriers</a>.  It should have been obvious, but I was having trouble finding a definitive answer.  So I can once again delude myself into believing I understand it all.</p>

I am just trying figure out how to create the form on the Users#new action. I am using simple_form. Here is my DB Schema:</p>

<pre><code>ActiveRecord::Schema.define(:version =&gt; 20120831144008) do

  create_table ""answers"", :force =&gt; true do |t|
    t.integer  ""user_id""
    t.integer  ""question_id""
    t.text     ""response""
    t.datetime ""created_at"",  :null =&gt; false
    t.datetime ""updated_at"",  :null =&gt; false
  end

  add_index ""answers"", [""user_id"", ""question_id""], :name =&gt; ""index_answers_on_user_id_and_question_id""

  create_table ""questions"", :force =&gt; true do |t|
    t.string   ""title""
    t.datetime ""created_at"", :null =&gt; false
    t.datetime ""updated_at"", :null =&gt; false
  end

  create_table ""users"", :force =&gt; true do |t|
    t.string   ""first_name""
    t.string   ""last_name""
    t.datetime ""created_at"",      :null =&gt; false
    t.datetime ""updated_at"",      :null =&gt; false
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>So on the users#new page, I am looping through the question titles, and need to create a text area below each question and have it get created. here is what I have for a form so far, it doesn't work and probably wont help much for a solution but.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= simple_form_for(@user) do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.input :first_name %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.input :last_name %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.input :email %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.input :phone %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.input :organization %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.input :primary_contact %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.association :answers, collection: @questions %&gt;
  &lt;% @questions.each do |question| %&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;&lt;%= question.title %&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
      &lt;%= text_field_tag 'questions[]' %&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.button :submit %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>I was able to get this to work, not sure if this is the absolute correct way but it's not completely ugly. In my controller I have <code>@user.answers.build</code> and in my simple_form I loop through questions, and create an answer field with the required data filled in.</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;% Question.all.each do |question| %&gt;
    &lt;%= f.simple_fields_for :answers do |a| %&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;
          &lt;%= question.title %&gt;
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;%= a.hidden_field :question_id, value: question.id %&gt;
        &lt;%= a.input :response, label: false %&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;% end %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;

<li>Button1 : real name of the button</li>
<li>Button Scenario : the text (dipslayed name) of the button</li>
<li>open : initial command (can be print or explore too...</li>
<li>notepad : executable (can be any file or CMD for another example)</li>
<li>/a : first argument</li>
<li>scenario.txt : 2nd argument</li>

So that I don't need to know what subclass of <code>NSManagedObject</code> I'm using at runtime, each subclass has the same name for its factory method, e.g. </p>

<pre><code>+ (id)objectWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info inManagedObjectContext:(NSManagedObjectContext *)context;
</code></pre>

<p>(For clarity, in this example suppose there is an entity deriving from <code>NSManagedObject</code> called <code>Item</code>, with generated files Item.m and Item.h, and my own category with files Item+Factory.m and Item+Factory.h, where the method above resides). </p>

<p>In Xcode 4.3 this generates no warning: but Xcode 4.4 (and above flag it as a warning: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(null): Meta method 'objectWithInfo:inManagedObjectContext:' in
  category from ...Item+Factory.o conflicts with same method from
  another category</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I'm well aware of the dangers of overloading a method in a category, it's a Bad Thing. What I'm doing here, however, is simply treating objects as a more general class than they are, which as fas as I'm aware is sensible.</p>

<p>Is what I'm doing bad? Or is there a different way to declare my methods to remove the warning?</p>

<p>Im using a flip transition, However, when my targetViewController flips into view, the view isn't initialised properly. The UISegmentedControl looks weird and one subview is in the wrong position. </p>

<p>Only after the animation finishes does everything settle into the correct location.</p>

<p>I do all my subview setup in viewWillAppear (not viewDidAppear), so i dont understand why it isn't initialised in time.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>I also notice (after debugging) that viewWillAppear is called before the viewDidLoad method? Why would it do this?</p>

<p>EDIT :</p>

<p>i ended up explicitly setting the binding in the markup of each ellipse :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Canvas DataContext=""{Binding Path=DataContext.Dice1,RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType=StackPanel}}""&gt;
     &lt;Ellipse Tag=""1"" Canvas.Left=""5"" Canvas.Top=""5"" Visibility=""{Binding Path=., Converter={StaticResource MyDiceInputToVisualConverter},ConverterParameter=1}""&gt;&lt;/Ellipse&gt;

<h1>My question is:</h1>

<h2>Is there any existing script can do both following two things?</h2>

<p><strong>1.   increase minor version by archive when using -AppStore scheme.</strong><br>
<strong>2.   increase build version by build.</strong>  </p>

<h2>P.S.</h2>

<p>I found <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6851660/version-vs-build-in-xcode-4"">Version vs build in XCode 4</a> , I have implement @nekno 's solution. </p>

<p>In Xcode 4.2:</p>

<p>Load your Xcode project.
In the left hand pane, click on your project at the very top of the hierarchy. This will load the project settings editor.
On the left-hand side of the center window pane, click on your app under the TARGETS heading. You will need to configure this setup for each project target.
Select the Build Phases tab.
At the bottom right, click the Add Build Phase button and select Add Run Script.
Drag-and-drop the new Run Script phase to move it to just before the Copy Bundle Resources phase (when the app-info.plist file will be bundled with your app).
In the new Run Script phase, leave the Shell: /bin/sh value alone. Copy and paste the following into the script area for integer build numbers:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash    
buildNumber=$(/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Print CFBundleVersion"" ""$INFOPLIST_FILE"")
buildNumber=$(($buildNumber + 1))
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Set :CFBundleVersion $buildNumber"" ""$INFOPLIST_FILE""
</code></pre>

<p>As @AlonAmir contributed, you can use the following script instead for hex build numbers:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash    
buildNumber=$(/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Print CFBundleVersion"" ""$INFOPLIST_FILE"")

<pre><code>MovieClip(parent).checkCollisonWithPlayer(this);
</code></pre>

<p>Where (parent) is a manager logic class. The parent does this</p>

<pre><code>public function checkCollisonWithPlayer(wall:MovieClip)
    {

        if(player != null)
        {
            Collision.block(player,wall);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now here's my problem. I have a class of Bullet.as that does much the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>private function onEnterFrame(event:Event):void
    {
         x+= _vx;
         //Check for collisions with walls and enemies
         MovieClip(parent).checkCollisionWithEnemies(this);
         //Remove if it leads off the stage
        if (x &gt; stage.stageWidth)
        {
            parent.removeChild(this);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>What if I wanted to check for a collision between one of these bullets() and one of these walls()? How can I do that? They're never in the same function at the same time and there's almost certainly more than one of each in play at any time. I'm new to AS and this feels like a common issue, but I couldn;t dig up any material that made sense. </p>

<p>Here;s what I need:</p>

<pre><code>public function checkCollisonWithWall(wall:MovieClip,bullet:MovieClip)
{

    if(bullet.hitTestObject(wall))
        Collision.block(bullet,wall);
    }

From what I have read the __get and __set methods are called when you accessing a field that is not ""accessible"".  So, obviously accessing a public field or a protected field within the class will not call these functions.  But what if I try to access $obj->a and a has never been defined before?  I originally thought this would call __get or __set but it seems it does not.  I know to solve this is to put all the dynamically created fields into a data array.</p>

<p>Is $obj->a therefore a public field?  Thank you very much!</p>

      $this-&gt;$field = $value;
    }
   }

   $obj-&gt;randomField = 1; //here randomField is set to 1 but the echo statement is not printed out in __set
   echo $obj-&gt;randomField;  //here, 1 will be echoed but not the statement in __get

<ul>
<li>I've got a page with a RadGrid tied to an ObjectDataSource that returns a collection of objects</li>
<li>On that page; I also have two lists; one contains Ids of objects that need to merged with the collection returned from the ObjectDataSource, and the other contains Ids of objects that need to be removed from that collection</li>
<li>The current process for handling this is very hack-ish; when an item is added to either one of those two lists; a separate method is called which dumps the results of myDataSource.Select() into a variable, and performs the manipulation.  The grid then has its DataSourceId cleared, and the collection is assigned to the DataSource property, and then DataBind is called. (essentially untying the ObjectDataSource and using manual databinding instead)</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is as follows:  Is it possible to somehow ""intercept"" the collection returned from the ObjectDataSource so I can manipulate the collection before it is passed to the RadGrid?</p>

<p>If this isn't possible; it's not a dealbreaker.  I believe I can modify the Select() method to accept the two lists; and perform the manipulation there.  Another avenue I have is to implement the NeedDataSource() event for the grid, and manipulate there as well.</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd like to use the first option.  Has anybody been successful doing this before?</p>

Occasionally, as defined by the business logic, an update submission of Form1 will trigger a <code>PrimeFaces</code> <code>p:dialog</code>, which contains <code>Form2</code> that collects extra data to complement Form1.  If the user provides data that passes validation, the submit <code>h:commandButton</code> in Form2 will invoke a backing bean method that will save the data from both forms.  However, if the user cancels the submit button or just closes the the p:dialog, I would like to roll back the state of the view to the last loaded values from the DB.</p>

<p>I have no preference whether to do it by using the PrimeFaces <code>RequestContext</code> from the backing bean in a method that is called by the cancel button or by doing it all in the JSF using either JSF EL or <code>f:ajax</code>.  How can this be done? </p>

<p>E.g. RequestContext has a method <code>reset(Collection&lt;String&gt; expressions)</code> but I would like to not be specifying each form field to be reset, instead do all of them.</p>

<p>Which is great and beautiful and does exactly what I want it to do.
Next I put it on a html page that I put together, you can see it here: 
<a href=""http://www.emich.edu/dining/draft/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emich.edu/dining/draft/index.html</a>
Again, this button display is working wonderfully and doing exactly what I want it to do.
Then I had to go through a specific server and use their system- which I'm a tad unfamiliar with and really forces you to separate everything, not just by folders but essentially you have two libraries working together to pull together the appropriate css, javascript, and html. As such, you can see that I do have a lot (against my better judgement) of inline styles and inclusion of javascript at the header rather than in a separate sheet. Nonetheless</p>

<p><a href=""http://webstage.emich.edu/dining-new/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webstage.emich.edu/dining-new/index.php</a></p>

<p>If you hit ""inspect source"" you see what I'm seeing when I'm working on it. The click-able display looks almost identical to the one on jsfiddle- but you hit Inspect Element and you see that all the <code>&lt;div class=""sidebarContent""&gt;</code> is embedded inside each other. As such, it won't display the appropriate pictures to fill the <code>&lt;div class=""sidebar""&gt;</code> area. </p>

<p>Any ideas??? Please and thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Make sure you don't juxtapose the request and response objects.  things will be easier if you dont.</strong>  </p>

<p>I am trying to POST data from a form with two inputs to a specific url node responds to.
Originally I was using the javascript xmlHTTPrequest object to send it.  The data was received but node could never read the object I tried sending which was JSON format.  Here is what it looked like when I converted it to a string:</p>

<pre><code>{ output: [], 
  outputEncodings: [],
  writable: true,
  _last: false,
  chunkedEncoding: false,
  shouldKeepAlive: true,
  useChunkedEncodingByDefault: true,
  _hasBody: true,
  _trailer: '',
  finished: false,
  socket: 
   { _handle: 
      { writeQueueSize: 0,
        socket: [Circular],
        onread: [Function: onread] },
     _pendingWriteReqs: 0,
     _flags: 0,
     _connectQueueSize: 0,
     destroyed: false,
     errorEmitted: false,
     bytesRead: 8442,
     bytesWritten: 1669569,
     allowHalfOpen: true,
     writable: true,
     readable: true,
</code></pre>

<p>This was not the full string.  I switched over to use an ajax post request instead because I thought serializearray() might create a different format that node could read but it was the same.  My server side code is essentially just:</p>

<pre><code>function email(request, response)
  form = '';
  request.setEncoding(""utf8"");
  request.on('data', function(chunk) {
    console.log('data received');
    form += chunk.toString();
  });

  request.on('end', function() {
    console.log('done receiving post data');
  });
</code></pre>

<p>My form looks like this</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;form name=""email"" action=""javascript:true;""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" name=""address"" value=""Enter your email address"" onFocus=""this.value=''""&gt;
    &lt;input class=""special"" type=""text"" name=""honeypot""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""submit""&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If I try parsing with JSON.parse, there is an error caused by unexpected o<br>
If I try parsing with querystring, it returns an empty object<br>
If I try something like console.log(form.address) the output is undefined but should be one of the values i submitted in the form.</p>

<p>my http server would route to /email and this is the function that responds to /email.</p>

<p>I checked and I know the on 'data' event has not expired because my code is set up to notify me of a 'data'event and I can see the event happening.  Locally, this code works fine and I can read the data submitted but on the development server it just doesn't work.</p>

<p>I know people will say I should be using connect or express but let's just suppose that was not an option, how could I get node to correctly process this data?  The jquery that submits the form is more or less standard.  Many thanks!</p>

<p>Sorry, I thought the problem would be fixed as I noticed immediately the posted string was not JSON.  Here is the code I am using to send the post.</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
  $(""#email"").submit(function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  var data = $(this).serializeArray();
  $.ajax({
    type: 'POST',
    dataType: 'json',
    url: '/email',
    data: JSON.stringify(data),
    success: function(msg) {
    $(""#aviso"").html(msg);
    }
    });
  });
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the string the data variable holds:</p>

<pre><code>[
  {
    ""name"": ""address"",
    ""value"": ""foo@bar.com""
  },
  {
    ""name"": ""honeypot"",
    ""value"": ""irobot""
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>This is valid JSON as per jsonlint.  But still the same error when it reaches the server.  Node handles the 'data' event and all is well until I try to parse the string, it causes an error undefined:1 unexpected o. </p>

If you make the change in EF and then rebuild the database the object it generates to represent this relationship is - unsurprisingly - an EntityCollection instead of a single type object.</p>

<p>For the moment I've been running through all the errors that this change generates and altering DatabaseObject references to DatabaseObject.ElementAt(0) just so I can get it to build. However one set of references won't seem to give me the extension methods on EntityCollection that allow one to operate on a collection - things like ElementAt(), Select(), First() and so on, and I can't see why.</p>

<p>In instances that work, the object is generated from a base class which is then inherited:</p>

<pre><code>            _task = _customersRepository.GetDeepTask(taskId);
            _customerService = _task.CustomerServiceFeature.CustomerService;

           //then in class which inherits above code

           string conStr = customerService.DatabaseObject.ElementAt(0).GetConnectionString(_customerService);
</code></pre>

<p>But in the instance that doesn't give me the extension methods, it's generated like this:</p>

<pre><code>    public void Execute(ScheduledTask task)
    {
        CustomerService service = task.CustomerServiceFeature.CustomerService;
        //this errors and doesn't offer extension methods
        string ConnectionString = service.DatabaseObject.GetConnectionString(service);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I can't see why these two instances are behaving differently?</p>

"7293912","1","7317284","","2011-09-03 15:06:10","","9","902","<p>Let's say i have a common base class/interface</p>

<pre><code>  interface ICommand
  {
    void Execute();
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Then there are a few commands inheriting from this interface.</p>

<pre><code>  class CommandA : ICommand
  {
    int x;
    int y;
    public CommandA(int x, int y)
    {  ...  }
    public void Execute () { ... }
  }
  class CommandB : ICommand
  {
    string name;
    public CommandB(string name)
    {  ...  }
    public void Execute () { ... }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Now i want to store these commands in a database, with a common method, and then later load all of them from the DB into a <code>List&lt;ICommand&gt;</code> and execute the Execute-method of them.</p>

<p>Right now I just have one table in the DB called commands and here i store a string serialization of the object. Basically the columns in the table are: <code>id|commandType|commaSeparatedListOfParameters</code>. While this is very easy and works good for <em>loading all</em> commands, I can't <em>query</em> the commands easily without using substring and other obscure methods. I would like to have an easy way of <code>SELECT id,x,y FROM commandA_commands WHERE x=...</code> and at the same time have a generic way of loading all commands from the commands-table (i guess this would be some kind of UNION/JOIN of commandA_commands, commandB_commands, etc). </p>

<p>It is important that not much manual fiddling in the DB, or manual creation of serialize/parse-methods, is required to add a new command. I have tons of them and new ones are added and removed all the time. I don't mind creating a command+table+query generation tool though if this would be required for the best solution.</p>

<p>The best i can think of myself is a common table like <code>id|commandType|param1|param2|param3|etc..</code> which isn't much better (actually worse?) than my current solution as many commands are going to need null parameters and the datatype will vary so i have to resort to common string conversion again and size each field big enough for the largest command.</p>

<p>The database is SQL Server 2008</p>

To fix this issue add an entry like this to your configuration file:

```

  ssl_verify_mode :verify_peer

  # OR, Verify only connections to chef-server

<p>1.Can data be sharded accross nodes of a cluster? Each node can be 'responsible' for a particular portion of the graph, but thats still not same as storing only a portion of the graph.</p>

<p>2.A query can be routed to the appropriate node, but is it possible to execute the query in parallel accross nodes? For instance, to process a traversal query, every node independently executes the portion of data it is responsible for and the results are later combined.</p>

the app shut down immediately. Please HELP I'm out of ideas.

<p>In discrete space, I need to draw random points along arbitrary implicit polynomials, of arbitrary dimension and arbitrary degree.</p>

<p>I work on it using C++, and I have the Eigen library available (however I doubt that any kind of solver could be used on any degree?). Higher level functions and languages are thus not a solution (MATLAB for example or even Python).</p>

<p>Anyway, my current naive way is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>draw a random point in space</li>
<li>determine the value of the isofunction for this point</li>
<li>create an adjacency ball of the point</li>
<li>of all neighbors, determine the closest to the surface</li>
<li>move the considered point in place of this neighbor. If the point move outside my range, just delete it</li>
<li>repeat until the isofunction is null</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I could see several way to improve. Do not generate a whole adjacency ball each time, but simply draw a line and make a sort of binary search along this line.</p>

<p>Anyway, the method is still very similar at its core.</p>

<p>(on a side note, the isofunction is continuous, however I use some kind of digitization to evaluate whether my point is actually lying on it or not)</p>

<p>My problem with this is that it is pretty low for large n (3+), and that, more importantly, the points will tend to concentrate on certain parts of the isosurface. I use this to generate datasets to evaluate some algorithms, so even if the distribution is not a problem of prime importance, the ability for me to control the quality of the dataset would be interesting.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to distribute random points on an isosurface?</p>

<p>The problem arises if for instance in the priority non-preemptive scheduling algorithm which always chooses the process with the highest priority to be run next and once running, process can only volontarily give up its CPU time, that is no other process can run until the currently running process finishes. It seems that what the solution the book proposes is that if both end of one process and arrival of the new high-priority process occur at the same time, the new high-priority process will be added to the ready queue and then chosen by the scheduler to be run next.</p>

<p>But in the other example in Round-robin algorithm, if there is only one process in the ready queue and it is currently running, if at the same time its quantum elapses and new process says its ready, it seems that the proposed solution is that the scheduling will be done first, so the currently running process will continue to run while the new process will be added to the queue. </p>

<p>I'd be grateful if someone clarified this to me, because I know from some other post that context switch does not occur in round robin for single process in queue, but is it true in general that scheduling is done before adding new process to queue.</p>

<pre><code>    Calendar calendar;

    int day= calendar.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);
    int month=calendar.get(Calendar.MONTH)+1; //it treats Jan as 0 hence i add 1

<pre><code>    921 (num) + 22334 (random num) = 92122334
    921 (num) + 2 (random num) = 92100002
</code></pre>

<p>Basically add 0s to the start ensuring number of digits remain the same. The use case of this is an easier way of generating unique order numbers that have an inbuilt time stamp as well. I dont expect to process more than 200 orders a day hence taking a 5 digit random  number seems reasonable enough for probability of duplicates to be very small.</p>

What stinks is that it requires 3 separate-but-nearly-identical methods: open the connection, create/execute the prepared statement, iterate over the results, return a list of the results. What we'd like to do is have just one method which would encapsulate that functionality, but we have the issue of specifying the unique data object. </p>

<p>So, my question is would reflection be reasonable in this situation? My understanding is that it should be avoided because it tends to be a red flag for poor design, but using it would greatly reduce the number of methods that would be created initially as well as further down the line. I am aware that there could be an if/else chain to determine which object it is, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>if(objectTypeStr.equals(""Foo"")){
   //insert into list of type Foo
}else if(objectTypeStr.equals(""Bar"")){
   //insert into list of type Bar (etc.)...
</code></pre>

<p>However I feel that this would become a gross method to deal with, making reflection a clean way of dealing with this.</p>

<p>I am open to any other ideas to solve this, thank you for reading through my question</p>

<p>How to make the green box to disappear when it leaves the red one? <code>:hover</code> in css doesn't work because green div is part of the red one (I quess), so cursor never actually leaves it. Only when you move themouse really quickly the green div can't keep up with the cursor and disappers. Perhaps adding some wrapper elements with specific positioning will do the trick? Or something like jQuery <code>stopPropagation()</code>?</p>

I added a transition, it disappears as I wanted it to, but now there's other problem. When cursor is moved outside the red box quickly, the green box stays at the border of it's parent.</p>

<p>But I think the error originates from here, in the PlayerControl class:</p>

<pre><code>    public float mSpeed = 10.0f;

}

void OnMouseExit(){
    transform.GetComponent&lt;Renderer&gt; ().material.color = Color.blue;

}

public void turnUpdate(){

    if (Vector3.Distance (moveDestination, transform.position) &gt; 0.1f) {
        transform.position += (moveDestination - transform.position).normalized * mSpeed * Time.deltaTime;

        if(Vector3.Distance(moveDestination, transform.position) &lt;= 0.1f){
            transform.position = moveDestination;
            GameManager.gObject.nextTurn();

        }
    }

<p>I also believe that this method from my 'Tile' class is relevant:</p>

<pre><code>    void OnMouseDown(){
    if (GameManager.gObject.getTurn ()) {
        GameManager.gObject.movePlayerChar (this, 0);
        GameManager.gObject.nextTurn ();
    }else{

<p>For illustration, the city of Oakland is NOT present in TableC. However, hourly observation data for Berkeley is derived by summing ( 0.5 x data for San Jose AND 0.5 x data for Oakland). </p>

<p>TableD structure:</p>

<pre><code>+----------------------------------+
| Date | ID | Name |  Hour | Value |
+----------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>TableD is the end result, which should be populated with hourly observation data for each day for each of the cities in TableA. </p>

<p>In my example HOUR 1 should look like the following, with Mississauga = 2.0 (1 x Toronto = 1 x 2 = 2), Hoboken = 5.10 (0.9 x New York City + 0.1 x Philadelphia = 0.9 x 5 + 0.1 x 6 = 5.10), and Berkeley = 2.50 (0.5 x San Jose + 0.5 x Oakland = 0.5 x 4 + 0.5 x San Francisco = 0.5 x 4 + 0.5 x 1 = 2.50):</p>

<pre><code>+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Date                | ID  |     Name    | Hour | Value |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| 2006-08-01 00:00:00 | 987 | Mississauga |  1   | 2.00  | 
| 2006-08-01 00:00:00 | 454 | Hoboken     |  1   | 5.10  |
| 2006-08-01 00:00:00 | 343 | Berkeley    |  1   | 2.50  | 
+--------------------------------------------------------+

<p>Now, the tricky part is Oakland is not present in TableC and instead it is mapped to San Francisco so any city that is mapped to Oakland needs to refer to the city that it is mapped to. In my situation, there are many situations where this occurs so I want to make sure I handle this properly.</p>

<p>I got as far as unpacking/normalizing TableC and joining it with Table B but not sure how to proceed. I know I need to use Group By but not sure how to do so with the caveat that I have described.</p>

<pre><code>select * from
(
    select Date, CID, Name, replace(Details, 'Hour', '') as Hour, ObservationValue
    from TableC
    as Result
    unpivot
    (
      ObservationValue for Details in ([Hour1], [Hour2], [Hour3], [Hour4], [Hour5], [Hour6],
      [Hour7],[Hour8],[Hour9],[Hour10],[Hour11],[Hour12],[Hour13],[Hour14],
      [Hour15],[Hour16],[Hour17],[Hour18],[Hour19],[Hour20],[Hour21],[Hour22],
      [Hour23],[Hour24])
)
as UnPvt
) as resultX
join TableB as b on (b.City2ID = resultX.CID)

<p>I mean, how they work? The 1st one, the AND function has to be true in order to get the permit effect.
What about the second one? Will just check if one of those two rules its true and give the permit effect or both rules has to be true like the first one?</p>

"29307448","1","","","2015-03-27 18:10:03","","0","164","<p>I'm looking at a python script that goes through a database and finds the valid phone numbers.  The part of the script that is relevant to my question looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    country_code = """"
</code></pre>

<p>(Then further down):</p>

<pre><code>    for i, entry in enumerate(feed.entry):
        for phone in entry.phone_number:
            # Strip out any non numeric characters
            phone.text = re.sub('\D', '', phone.text)
            phone.text = unicode(phone.text, 'utf8')

            # Remove leading digit if it exists, we will add this again later for all numbers
            # Only if a country code is defined.
            if country_code != """":
                phone.text = re.sub('^\+?%s' % country_code, '', phone.text)
</code></pre>

<p>First question is, I've seen two different variations of this script, one uses the last line I have shown above while the other uses this:</p>

<pre><code>                phone.text = re.compile('^\+?%s' % country_code, '', phone.text)
</code></pre>

<p>I am wondering what the difference is, and whether one is more correct than the other.</p>

<p>But the real issue is that this database is only supposed to contain North American numbers shown as 10 or 11 digits, but what I need is ten digit numbers only.  Unfortunately this script returns any phone number it finds.  So after that last line runs, what I'd like to see happen is this:</p>

<p>If the phone.text string is less than ten characters or more than 11 characters in length, set it to null.</p>

<p>Then</p>

<p>If the phone.text string is 11 characters in length then if first character is ""1"", strip the leading ""1"" leaving the final 10 characters.  If the first character is NOT ""1"" then set it to null.</p>

<p>Then</p>

<p>If the phone.text string is 10 characters (in other words, not null, since it should be either 10 characters or null at this point) then check to see that the first digit and the fourth digit are in the range 1-9.  If either are not in that range, set the string to null.</p>

<p>I know absolutely zilch about python so I was hoping maybe someone could show me how to do this, since it seems like something that should be relatively easy.  By the way the documentation (such as it is) says that if you put a ""1"" in the country code field it will add it to numbers that don't have it now, which doesn't seem right to me (I can't see how that would happen) but also it's the exact opposite of what I want in this particular case.  Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT:  I did not want to use a REGEX because to be honest, this is not a time-sensitive application (I can afford to waste CPU cycles) and I really have trouble deciphering Regular Expressions - they only barely make sense to me.</p>

<p>I did find that if, after the line</p>

<pre><code>            phone.text = unicode(phone.text, 'utf8')
</code></pre>

<p>I added these lines:</p>

<pre><code>            if len(phone.text) == 11 and phone.text[0] == '1':
                #international code
                phone.text = phone.text[1:]
            if len(phone.text) &lt; 10:
                phone.text = """"
            if len(phone.text) &gt; 10:
                phone.text = phone.text[:10]
</code></pre>

<p>Then it would pretty much do what I needed.  As I noted the database does not contain any international numbers, so that consideration is absent.  It does contain a few numbers with extensions following, but I only needed the 10 digit primary numbers, not the extensions, so anything after the first ten digits is chopped off.  The above was actually deciphered after looking a the suggested REGEX-based solutions, where someone suggested that a regex isn't always the best way to do things, an sentiment with which I wholeheartedly agree.  Besides, while there were a lot of REGEX's shown to parse phone numbers in various ways, most of those answers just assumed you know how to use a REGEX in Python and I don't, given my total lack of familiarity with the language.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> I have a ListView and wish to dynamically add ListViewItems with their own unique images in the first column. Furthermore these images can be updated depending upon state changes</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How would you do you do this?</p>

<p><strong>Code I'm working with</strong></p>

<pre><code>        private void AddToMyList(SomeDataType message)
        {
            string Entrykey = message.ID;

            //add its 1 column parameters
            string[] rowEntry = new string[1];
            rowEntry[0] = message.name;

            //make it a listviewItem and indicate its row
            ListViewItem row = new ListViewItem(rowEntry, (deviceListView.Items.Count - 1));

            //Tag the row entry as the unique id
            row.Tag = Entrykey;

            //Add the Image to the first column
            row.ImageIndex = 0;

            //Add the image if one is supplied
            imagelistforTypeIcons.Images.Add(Entrykey, message.marker.markerIcon);

            //finally add it to the device list view
            typeListView.Items.Add(row);

        }

The output of these queries is fed into another process which (as a side effect) can record the progress of the query (i.e., the last row fetched).</p>

<p>It would be nice if, in the event that the task stopped half way through for some reason, it could be restarted. For this to happen, the query has to return rows in a consistent order, so it has to be sorted. The obvious thing to do is to sort on the primary key; however, there is probably going to be a penalty for this in terms of performance (an index access) versus a non-sorted solution. Given that a restart may never happen this is not desirable.</p>

<p>Is there some trick to ensure consistent ordering in another way? Any other suggestions for maintaining performance in this case?</p>

<p>EDIT: I have been looking around and seen ""order by rowid"" mentioned. Is this useful or even possible?</p>

<p>EDIT2: I am adding some benchmarks:</p>

<ul>
<li>With no order by: 17 seconds. </li>
<li>With order by PK: 46 seconds. </li>
<li>With order by rowid: 43 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>So any order by has a savage effect on performance, and using rowid makes little difference. Accepted answer is - there is no easy way to do it.</p>

<p>I can set content header this way --header ""Content-Type: application/json"" But when my content body will have files to be sent, will content type header application/json work?
Do i need to change the content-type header if my body has file in it?</p>

<p>My question is: On what part did I fail to implement the heapsort-algorithm? Where are the unnecessary comparisons?</p>

<p>They have to be in the sortNode function. I marked all the comparisons with comments.</p>

<p>I dont see how I can improve this function, to do less comparisons. So that would be my question.</p>

<p>We have tried different menu plugins, as well as deleting and remaking the menu items, nothing seems to fix this. I would say its a bug with joomla 2.5, but we don't want to have to hack this to work when it ""should"" be fixed in a new version. Did anyone else have a similar problem and got it to work? or is this bug more or less isolated to us (the joomla install)?</p>

<p>If any more details are needed i will be happy to try and provide more, the situation is confusing for us as joomla allows up to ten levels of menus natively.</p>

<p>Obviously media queries is the way to go but they only concern CSS.</p>

<p>In my current project, I would like to organise the page differently according to the width of the page (being completely device agnostic).
The thing is, on small widths, I would like the HTML layout to change completely so I will have to make the HTML ""responsive"" as well as it should change according to the website width.</p>

<p>How can I achieve that?
Is there any js library (jQuery if possible but not mandatory) that will ""serve"" another html page according to the width of the page?</p>

<p>The whole website should be build this way so the script should be more than a gadget, it should be rock solid enough to allow the whole website to rely on it.
And, of course, it should work on any device or screen or browser.</p>

<p>Some would say that I'm looking for adaptive techniques more than responsive ones but I believe it's a mix between those two as the elements will still be responsive in general but between some critical breakpoints, it will indeed adapt and change the html.</p>

<p>But when I looked in analytics for documents, I have found that there are many documents which don't match query. But number of documents is the same.</p>

<p>Here is my analytics module:</p>

<pre><code>public class ResourceAnalyticsCollector extends DelegatingCollector{

        String docId = doc.get(AnalyticsConstants.ID_SOLR_FIELD);
        System.out.println(""Doc id = "" + docId);

When running it from our C# .NET application to insert 30 records in a row, it's taking roughly 4 seconds total to complete (only counting the tame it takes to run the SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery() method).  However, calling the same exact stored procedure from within SQL Server Management Studio the same number of times only takes about 0.4 seconds.  I can't figure out what's different between the 2 setups that would make such a difference of 10x speed.</p>

<p>I have tried all of the following with no noticeable change in speed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creating the stored procedure ""WITH RECOMPILE""</li>
<li>Checking all of the ""SET"" values that are configured within SSMS and C#.  The only difference one was SET ARITHABORT, which was ON in SSMS and OFF when called from the .NET application.  Adding ""SET ARITHABORT ON"" to the start of the stored procedure made no difference, though.</li>
<li>Removed all default values from the sproc parameters</li>
</ol>

<p>The code used to call the stored procedure from the .NET application is:</p>

<pre><code>using (SqlConnection newConn = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
 {
   using (SqlCommand uCmd = new SqlCommand(""sproc_name"", newConn))
   {
      uCmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
      uCmd.Connection.Open();

      //About 15 parameters added using:
      uCmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@ParamName"", value);
      ...

      //One output parameter
      SqlParameter paramOUT = new SqlParameter(""@OutPutKey"", SqlDbType.UniqueIdentifier);
      paramOUT.Direction = ParameterDirection.Output;
      uCmd.Parameters.Add(paramOUT);

      uCmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
      uCmd.Connection.Close();
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The stored procedure itself is just a list of set commands (SET ANSI_NULLS ON, SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON, SET ARITHABORT ON), a list of non-defaulted parameters, and the setting of the output variable that will be the new uniqueidentifier that will be inserted as the primary key in the table, followed by the INSERT statement itself.  </p>

<p>The application is build on .NET 4 and the SQL server is  MS SQL Server 2005.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the insert stored procedure it's calling:</p>

<pre><code>alter procedure InsertStuff
@Field1 uniqueidentifier,
@Field2 datetime,
...
@CreateDate datetime,
@PrimaryKEY uniqueidentifier OUTPUT
AS

declare @newCreateDate datetime 
set @newCreateDate=getDate()

set @PrimaryKEY = NEWID()

INSERT INTO [dbo].[Table]
(
    Field1,
    Field2,
    ...
    CreateDate,
    PrimaryKEY
)

I do not believe I'm getting issues from the setups of these things, though: the only thing that is not working is trying to POST information from Pyjamas-generated forms. Trying to use Pyjamas-generated forms in my application produces 403s (the ""CSRF verification failed"" error page).</p>

<p>I have spent hours on this and read all of the answers I could find on here related to CSRF and Pyjamas, and done a lot of external research just on CSRF and Django, Django and Ajax, etc. If this question isn't reaching anyone who has knows just what to do in this situation, I think I've whittled down the essence of the question.</p>

<p>How would one get the <code>{% csrf_token %}</code> into the Pyjamas-generated form? It seems like it might be impossible, because from what I understand CSRF tokens are not persistent, which a Pyjamas-generated page is ... My Pyjamas page is generated from a Pyjamas <code>.py</code> file, resulting in a folder full of hard-coded stuff. How is it that I would integrate the current CSRF token into that already-coded form?</p>

<p>Please don't hesitate to ask for more details, this issue has been incredibly hard to navigate. None of the published information on integrating Pyjamas &amp; Django regards this; and the only solutions I've found that seem aware of CSRF in Django say you should probably just disable CSRF protection (which I <em>could</em> do, but what protection could I put in place of it? My own cookie system? Is it a terrible idea to disable CSRF protection in any case?).</p>

I might have a few imports and a class definition or two in each. I'm wondering, is there any reason I should or shouldn't merge these into one module, something like <code>misc.py</code>?</p>

<p>My thoughts are that having separate modules helps with code clarity, and later on, if by some chance these modules grow to more than 10 lines, I won't feel so bad about having them separated. But on the other hand, it just seems like such a waste to have a bunch of files with only a few lines in each! And is there any significant difference in resource usage between the multi-file vs. single-file approach? (Of course I'm nowhere near the point where I should be worrying about resource usage, but I couldn't resist asking...)</p>

<p>I checked around to see whether this had been asked before and didn't see anything specific to Python, but if it's in fact a duplicate, I'd appreciate being pointed in the right direction.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:  Ok, so its not just the session that is null... the whole context is screwed up.  When the webpart enters the init, the context is fine... but when it reaches the dropbox selectedindexchange postback event (the dropbox contains node id's to use to set the rootnode variable), the context contains mostly null properties.</p>

<p>also, it only seems to happen when certain id's are selected.  This looks more like some kind of weird bug on my end than a problem with my understanding of the session.</p>

<p>The way I achieved this originally was by editing SPCommon.png in an image editor and replacing it via the SharePoint Mapped Folder like so: <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ygzxu.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I then used CSS to move the image in it's frame so the white cog was shown instead of black.  Great it works a treat and worked for months.</p>

<p>I've subsequently learnt this is against Microsoft best practice and rightly so because it all came unstuck when the latest service pack was installed which overwrote the customised image and the feature stopped working. </p>

<p><a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd458798.aspx#id0090122"" rel=""nofollow"">10 Best Practices For Building SharePoint Solutions</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 12 hive is a shared Web application space. If you plan on hosting multiple Web apps in the same farm, you need to ensure that your SharePoint solutions do not overwrite existing SharePoint files or files deployed by other solutions in this space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I decided that as I didn't need to replace this file anymore and in fact I shouldn't that I should remove it from the solution so that it doesn't get deployed anymore.  Seemed the right step at the time.  In development this was fine, in staging it was fine, the file just doesn't get deployed.  BUT..... in production the file gets deleted from the HIVE and no longer exists!  Crud!</p>

<p>There must be a certain set of conditions which cause this to happen, that's what I hate about SharePoint it is so inconsistent. I haven't worked out yet what the differences are that cause it but not only does it get deleted during a deploy, it seems to keep getting deleted and the Enterprise Admins keep having to replace the file in the file system by copying it back out of the staging farm onto every server in the farm.  This is not good.....</p>

<p>Fortunately I haven't had to admit to them that I caused this problem yet, this is the next confession, because I couldn't prove it although I was very concerned.  Yesterday I deployed our solution into our departments development server, yes CI is on the TODO list too, where-as I usually use my local VM.  Low and behold the file get's deleted on this server during the deploy.  This is good and bad, I now have an environment which is displaying the problem which I have full control over but the bad news is it is my fault.</p>

<p>So the next step is to try and diagnose what in the solution, or lack in the solution is causing this to happen?</p>

<p>I have had to change the way this is derived so as to not replace the file, but I have also learnt that my second attempt is still not right and I should be using the Theme Engine, but that is work to improve for another day once I get this fixed.

<p>If it's relevant: I'm trying to match an interface of an old (web)application to a new one. The URL is redirected on the server.

<p>I'd like my version of clang to be</p>

<li>Neither dependent on the system gcc nor the imported gcc 4.9 (that is, their C/C++ runtimes)</li>
<li>In particular, neither the compilers, the compiler-as-a-library libclang.so, nor programs built with the new compiler should depend on libstdc++, but they should use the newly built libc++.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can do this, but it involves putting clang, llvm, libc++, libc++abi (and things I might have forgotten) in one tree, building clang from one build directory, then setting a lot of flags blindly and building it again from a second build directory.</p>

<p>Is there another proper way of bootstrapping clang with libc++? I believe there must be, since the official binaries of llvm &amp; clang are self-sufficient as I described above.</p>

<a href=""http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/writing-an-hadoop-mapreduce-program-in-python/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/writing-an-hadoop-mapreduce-program-in-python/</a></p>

<p>The author starts with naive versions of the mapper and the reducer. Here is the reducer (I removed some comments for brevity)</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

from operator import itemgetter
import sys

current_word = None
current_count = 0
word = None

# input comes from STDIN
for line in sys.stdin:
    line = line.strip()

    word, count = line.split('\t', 1)

    try:
        count = int(count)
    except ValueError:
        continue

    if current_word == word:
        current_count += count
    else:
        if current_word:
            # write result to STDOUT
            print '%s\t%s' % (current_word, current_count)
        current_count = count
        current_word = word

# do not forget to output the last word if needed!
if current_word == word:
    print '%s\t%s' % (current_word, current_count)
</code></pre>

<p>The author tests the program with:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""foo foo quux labs foo bar quux"" | /home/hduser/mapper.py | sort -k1,1 | /home/hduser/reducer.py
</code></pre>

<p>So the reducer is written as if a reducer job's input data was like:</p>

<pre><code>aa 1
aa 1
bb 1
cc 1
cc 1
cc 1
</code></pre>

<p>My initial understand of a reducer was that the input data for a given reducer would contain one unique key. So in the previous examples, 3 reducers jobs would be needed. Is my understand incorrect?</p>

<p>Then the author presents improved versions of the mapper and the reducer. Here is the reducer:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
""""""A more advanced Reducer, using Python iterators and generators.""""""

from itertools import groupby
from operator import itemgetter
import sys

def read_mapper_output(file, separator='\t'):
    for line in file:
        yield line.rstrip().split(separator, 1)

def main(separator='\t'):
    # input comes from STDIN (standard input)
    data = read_mapper_output(sys.stdin, separator=separator)

    for current_word, group in groupby(data, itemgetter(0)):
        try:
            total_count = sum(int(count) for current_word, count in group)
            print ""%s%s%d"" % (current_word, separator, total_count)
        except ValueError:
            # count was not a number, so silently discard this item
            pass

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>The author adds the following warning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The following Map and Reduce scripts will only work “correctly”
  when being run in the Hadoop context, i.e. as Mapper and Reducer in a
  MapReduce job. This means that running the naive test command “cat
  DATA | ./mapper.py | sort -k1,1 | ./reducer.py” will not work
  correctly anymore because some functionality is intentionally
  outsourced to Hadoop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't understand why the naive test command doesn't work with the new version. I thought the use of <code>sort -k1,1</code> would produce the same input for both versions of the reducer. What am I missing?</p>

This App will produce what will ultimately appear in the detail-bottom portion of the report. It will store its output in a file system. After App has produced its output (and shutdown), a seperate ""Service"" will produce the final report ""merging"" the content produced by the App (the service provides the content of the header, footer and detail-top areas). If I was generating this by hand in Word, I would be in essense inserting a word document into final report document as an object. </p>

<p>I'm trying to identify an appropriate technology to accomplish this.</p>

<p>Requirements include:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Service producing the final report will be a Java service runnig
on a Linux machine. I will be developing this code.</li>
<li>The App producing the detail-bottom content could be a Windows
(e.g., C#) or Linux (e.g., Java) application. Any number of other
developers would be developing this code and interfacing with my
service through a SDK I will provide. They are presumed to be
skilled developers but I don't know what experience they have with
any report generation technology</li>
<li>The template utilized by the service will give the same look &amp; feel
to the finished report regardless of the App that is run, while the
App will have total control over the content of the detail-bottom
section of the finished report. In other words, if the template
allocates a ""frame"" of say 7Wx5H in the finished report for the
detail-bottom section, the App would in essence have a 7x5W blank
page to work with.</li>
<li>The finished report could be multiple pages and the first page could
be different than the remaining pages. If the App produces multiple
(e.g., 7Hx5W pages), the service would merge each App page into the
detail-bottom section of each page of the finished report, thereby
leaving the App to deal with pagenation as it would if it was
producing the entire report itself.</li>
<li>At some point I want to provide the end user a UI for managing the
layout of the finished report (template).</li>
<li>I'll don't really care how the App developer produces the content to
be inserted into detail-bottom frame and as he is providing me with
a finished executable for me to run, I will not provide him with any
UI to manage his report layout/content</li>
<li>The finished report delivered to the end user will be as a PDF.</li>
<li>Since I'm not sure about the skill set of the App developer and
there could be many Apps and developers, I want them to produce
output I can accept for merging into the dertail-bottom frame with
is well accepted, supported and not overly burdensome to use.</li>
</ol>

<p>Various technologies suggested to me thus far are:</p>

<li>Apache FOP (XML-FO)</li>
<li>DOCX</li>

<p>As you can see here, the data per line is last name, first name, student ID number, and then courses associated with that identification. I am able to read everything else in, except because the number of courses associated can vary, ideally from 0 to 5 (assignment has a cap on it), I am having trouble in how to recognize and parse the courses into my struct. Can someone simply suggest a way to read this in?</p>

<p>I am using the following code to read the rest in. I have commented out a section to fill in for reading in the courses</p>

<pre><code>ptr = strtok(temp, "","");
(*students)[*count_stud].last = (char*) malloc(strlen(ptr)*sizeof(char));
strcpy((*students)[*count_stud].last, ptr)
ptr = strtok(NULL, "","");
(*students)[*count_stud].first = (char*) malloc(strlen(ptr)*sizeof(char));
strcpy((*students)[*count_stud].first, ptr);
ptr = strtok(NULL, "","");
strcpy((*students)[*count_stud].ssid, ptr);
/*while(ptr = strtok(NULL, "",""))
{
}*/ //end while crn strtok
(*count_stud)++;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my struct, I have figured out everything but crn[6] and count_classes.</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct
{
  char* first;
  char* last;
  char ssid[15];
  int crn[6];
  int count_classes;
}Student;
</code></pre>

<p>I have declared the struct as follows and then used malloc appropriately (I am not to use malloc for the crn's)</p>

<pre><code>Student *students=NULL;

<p>Each of the .txt files contains DNA sequence alignment data, and each file basically reads out several dozen different possible sequences. I'm only interested in one of the sequences in each file, and I want to be able to use a script to excise that sequence from all of the files and combine them into a single file that I can then feed into a program that translates the sequences into protein code.

<p>We have x86 CPU and operating memory, this memory resembles some memory pool, that consist of addressable memory units that can be read or written to, using their address by <code>MOV</code> instruction of CPU (we can move memory from / to this memory pool).</p>

<p>Given that our program is the kernel, we have a full access to whole this memory pool. However if our program is not running directly on hardware, the kernel creates some ""virtual"" memory pool which lies somewhere inside the physical memory pool, our process consider it just as the physical memory pool and can write to it, read from it, or change its size usually by calling something like <code>sbrk</code> or <code>brk</code> (on Linux).</p>

<p>My question is, how is this virtual pool implemented? I know I can read whole linux source code and maybe one year I find it, but I can also ask here :)</p>

<p>I suppose that one of these 3 potential solutions is being used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interpret the instructions of program (very ineffective and unlikely): the kernel would just read the byte code of program and interpret each instruction individually, eg. if it saw a request to access memory the process isn't allowed to access it wouldn't let it.</li>
<li>Create some OS level API that would need to be used in order to read / write to memory and disallow access to raw memory, which is probably just as ineffective.</li>
<li>Hardware feature (probably best, but have no idea how that works): the kernel would say ""dear CPU, now I will send you instructions from some unprivileged process, please restrict your instructions to memory area <code>0x00ABC023 - 0xDEADBEEF</code>"" the CPU wouldn't let the user process do anything wrong with the memory, except for that range approved by kernel.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason why am I asking, is to understand if there is any overhead in running program unprivileged behind the kernel (let's not consider overhead caused by multithreading implemented by kernel itself) or while running program natively on CPU (with no OS), as well as overhead in memory access caused by computer virtualization which probably uses similar technique.</p>

<li>it would be nice to avoid separate, quite large (comparing to <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code>) block of code</li>
<li>it should be quite DOM-safe, so wrapping a clickable element in some decorator should not break the code (breakable example: <code>parentNode.submit();</code>)</li>
<li>The clickable Tag should be an anchor i.e <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, not <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;submit&gt;</code></li>
<li>it should work with file upload/multipart form</li>
</ul>

That means trying to send the response in chunks instead of sending it as a whole so that user feels that page is fast. I am successful in doing that by using the flushBuffer method on the response object in java. But now when I try to compress the content with apache mod_deflate module, chunking is lost. </p>

<p>Here is the configuration from apache used to compress the content</p>

<p>** </p>

<h1>Begin mod_deflate config</h1>

<pre><code>DeflateBufferSize 100
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml text/javascript

LogFormat '""%r"" %{output_info}n/%{input_info}n (%{ratio_info}n%%)' deflate

</code></pre>

<h1>End mod_deflate config**</h1>

<p>Here is the response header when the deflate is turned on in apache</p>

<p>Connection:Keep-Alive<br>
<strong>Content-Encoding:gzip</strong><br>
Content-Length:7916<br>
Content-Type:text/html; charset=UTF-8<br>

<p>Response header when the deflate is turned off in apache  </p>

Keep-Alive:timeout=300, max=3997<br>
Server:Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)<br>
<strong>Transfer-Encoding:chunked</strong>  </p>

<p>As you can see in above 2 headers chunking is working only if the compression is turned off. I was searching on internet regarding this and people were suggesting to decrease the <strong>DeflateBufferSize</strong> value. I decreased the value to 100 bytes as you can see in my apache config but that still didn't solve the problem. DeflateBufferSize set to 100 bytes means that response is buffered in apache till 100 bytes are received and then the it is compressed.</p>

<p>I was looking at the mod_gzip module which was bundled with the old apache 1.3 and that module has a following directive which allows chunked content to be gzipped.</p>

<p>mod_gzip_dechunk              Yes  </p>

<p>Does anyone know of such directive in mod_deflate bundled with apache 2.x?</p>

<p>Or Does anyone know how to compress the chunked content?</p>

<p>I know there is a way to get the model and localized model of the phone by using the command [[UIDevice currentDevice] model]  or [[UIDevice currentDevice] localizedModel], but on several iPhones, both commands generate the same result, which is ""iPhone"" (or ""iPad"" for all iPads).</p>

<p>I was hoping to find a way to detect whether the device is an iPhone 3, 3S, 4, 4S, or 5 (or iPad 1, 2, etc).  Is this value hidden within the uniqueIdentifier, or is there an easier way to find this?</p>

<p>As the title states the buttons function doesn't always fire when clicked on. There are some spots/pixels which doesn't seem to register the click (which is weird since the button still does change its appearance when clicked on these sweet spots - but it's not firing its onClick  function).</p>

<p>So here is the code I use to generate the button: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""margin-left:500px; margin-top:100px;""&gt;
    &lt;a href='#' class='button gray glossy' data-icon='✎' onClick='clickHandler()' /&gt;
Try clicking this button&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the simple JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>var timesClicked = 0;

function clickHandler() {
    console.log(""I've been clicked "" + timesClicked + ""times."");
    ++timesClicked;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The spot (rather at which height the spot is found) which doesn't seem to register is located a few pixels below the baseline of the text in the button. Try clicking just below the text a few times with the console up (the click registers in the console) and notice when you find the spot. The sweet spot isn't that hard to find and makes the button pretty useless since clicking on it at a certain height of the button won't register. </p>

"21094019","1","21094625","","2014-01-13 14:44:05","","1","2220","<p>I have a WPF application that includes ~50 controls that are bound to properties on my business object which implements INotifyPropertyChanged.  Here's a quick snippet of my business object:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyBusinessObject : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    private void OnPropertyChanged(PropertyChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        if (PropertyChanged != null)
        {
            PropertyChanged(this, e);
        }
    }

    // properties begin here
    private string _name;
    public string Name
    {
        get { return _name; }
        set
        {
            if (_name == value)
            {
                return;
            }

            _name = value;
            OnPropertyChanged(new PropertyChangedEventArgs(""Name""));
        }
    }

    // constructor, etc. not shown
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also have several validation rules that are used to validate the user input in these controls.  I'm using command binding to prevent my user from saving the data if there are any validation errors.  My application also includes a ""Reset default values"" button which, obviously, will reset the default value for all of the properties on my business object.  This all works exactly as I'd like it to with one exception.  If my user enters invalid data into one or more controls and then clicks the ""Reset default values"" button, the controls that contain invalid data don't always update as I'd expect.  This happens because of the following code in my property setters:</p>

<pre><code>if (_name == value)
{
    return;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code exists to prevent unnecessary property changed notifications from occurring when the value entered by my user in the bound UI control is the same value that the property is already set to.  As an example, I have an IntegerUpDown control in my UI (this control is part of the Extended WPF Toolkit from Xceed).  The default value of the property that my control is bound to is 10.  My user deletes the value from the control and my validation rule is triggered which results in a validation error and the UI is updated appropriately with an error adorner, etc.  The value of the property that this control is mapped to hasn't been changed so it's still set to 10.  Now my user clicks the ""Reset default values"" button which will result in the default value (10) for the property being reset.  However, the value for the property is <em>already</em> set to 10 so the short circuit logic in my setter will return instead of setting the property value.</p>

<p>So now, after my user clicks ""Reset default values"", I am also forcing an update on my binding target like this:</p>

<pre><code>this.myIntegerUpDown.GetBindingExpression(Xceed.Wpf.Toolkit.IntegerUpDown.ValueProperty).UpdateTarget();
</code></pre>

<p>This solves my problem but only for this particular control.  Is there any easy way to do this for <em>all</em> of my bound controls without having to specify each one?  Thanks.</p>

Let's say I'm drawing an image in the center of a view, using the drawAsPatternInRect. Now if I move this rectangular area around, the drawn background still fills the whole area, but it's coordinates are fixed, i.e. they do not move with the rect, which makes it look like the drawing area is just a transparent 'window' to some static background. What I would like to achieve is to make it look like the background is moving together with the area itself.</p>

<p>As you can see from the js file I am struggling to understand how would be the best way to setup the query. 
I am not sure if I have created my data incorrectly and I should rather store the students in the schools collection. My logic tells me that this would be easier to count and be more reactive, I have however decided to store the school id in the student with the logic that all information about a student is in their user document.</p>

<p>I also would like to on another page that lists the number of students per year for the school duplicate this type of search so that I could add that result to the year badge.</p>

<p>I would really appreciate the help. </p>

<p>EDIT: I have made some changes to the helper code that look like this</p>

<pre><code>Template.schoolList.helpers({
schools: function () {
    return Schools.find({});
},
totalalumnis: function () {
    return AlumniList.find({schoolName: this._id}).count();
}
});
</code></pre>

<p>I have tested the query in the browser console and if I ad a valid schoolName id it returns the correct count of the number of students. This however does not get displayed in the template.</p>

<p>Can someone help?</p>

So the deal is: when the user drop an image into the browser (drag'n'drop), it's sent to the server using AJAX and when the upload is finished, it simply add a class ""<strong>done</strong>"" to some div tag.</p>

<p>So whenever the user drops an image, it adds this kind of div:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""preview""&gt;/* blablabla other div and span classes */&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And when the upload is complete, it simply looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""preview done""&gt;/* blablabla other div and span classes */&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works like a charm, so here's the interesting part from the form:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""target.php"" method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"" 
onsubmit=""return checkUploadFiles();""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It calls this JS function in order to prevent submitting if one files is not fully uploaded yet:</p>

<pre><code>function checkUploadFiles(){
    $("".preview"").each(function(i, val) {
        if(!val.hasClass('done')){
            alert(""Something is not fully uploaded yet, please wait"");
            return false;
        };
    });
    return true;
};
</code></pre>

<p>But... The form is sent anyway, even if there's 15 images uploading right now and 15 div tags having the <strong>.preview</strong> class but not the <strong>.done</strong> class.</p>

<p>I'm sure Iv'e done some stupid mistakes or that's just something I don't know about <strong>.each()</strong> or <strong>.hasClass()</strong>, can someone help please?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Here's the corrected script, considering the two mistakes I've made:</p>

<pre><code>function checkUploadFiles(){
    var ret = true;
    $("".preview"").each(function() {
        var $this = $(this);
        if(!$this.hasClass('done')){
            alert(""Something is not fully uploaded yet, please wait"");

<p>We have an observable collection in our view model, with a simple binding expression on the ItemsSource on the ComboBox.  In the page's Loaded event, we are calling a domain service to retrieve the items, then in it's Completed event we are storing the returned items into the collection.  Nothing fancy.</p>

<p>Firstly, when we deployed the solution in Release mode, the combobox's had no values.  I opened fiddler and saw the request and response from the domain service, and it was in fact successfully returning the correct data to the client.  However the combobox's had no data in them.</p>

<p>I rebuilt in Debug|Any CPU configuration, hit the same URL and it worked straight away - the combobox's were filled with data.  Problem solved?  Not quite.</p>

<p>We then gave the URL to someone else to test (on the same network/subnet) and the combobox
s were empty again.  It works on 5 machines, and doesn't work on the rest.  I checked fiddler, and the response is coming back with all the data - Silverlight just doesn't populate the comboboxes.</p>

<p>We have tried a number of things - IE no addons, chrome incognito's, cross domain and client access policies... nothing seems to make a difference.  We've tried running the browsers as administrator, we've even tried on very old machine running IE6, same issue (ie no UAC or anything strange there).  No anti-virus installed on any of the machines.  At a complete loss.  We've tried machines on the company domain, and off the domain with no difference - different operating systems (xp/win7).</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas or solutions for me on this problem?  Seems like there's something installed on the machine doing it?</p>

<p>Do I have to follow such structure for the JAVA/Servlet side.</p>

After some digging, I tracked down the problem with nerve to the <a href=""https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js"" rel=""nofollow"">bcrypt</a> module, which is apparently written in C/C++ and has to be compiled after the package manager downloads it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems like if you want this to work on Windows, the answer is (from one of the bcrypt issues threads) ""install a Linux VM"". So earlier today I did just that, and started running into other dependencies (you need <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3329355/node-js-could-not-configure-a-cxx-compiler-ubuntu"">certain unnamed apt packages</a> installed before you can even think about building, despite GCC being installed), then eventually after seeing yet another C compiler error (about some package or other not being able to find ""Arrays.c"" I think), I actually gave up, and switched from nerve to express instead. Ironically, the larger and more complicated express installs with npm on Linux and Windows without a single issue.</p>

<p>So, my question is: is there any filter / dependency tracking available that lets you see if a package has additional dependencies besides node core? Because to me the allure of node is ""everything in Javascript"", and this kind of stuff dispels the illusion quite unpleasantly. In fact, despite having done more than my time working with C/C++, whenever I see a requirement to ""make"" something these days I generally run in the other direction screaming. :)</p>

<p>Let's start with these three recursive generic interfaces<sup><strong>&dagger;</strong></sup> that represent immutable stacks:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>interface IStack&lt;T&gt;
{
    INonEmptyStack&lt;T, IStack&lt;T&gt;&gt; Push(T x);
}

interface IEmptyStack&lt;T&gt; : IStack&lt;T&gt;
{
    new INonEmptyStack&lt;T, IEmptyStack&lt;T&gt;&gt; Push(T x);
}

interface INonEmptyStack&lt;T, out TStackBeneath&gt; : IStack&lt;T&gt;
    where TStackBeneath : IStack&lt;T&gt;
{
    T Top { get; }
    TStackBeneath Pop();
    new INonEmptyStack&lt;T, INonEmptyStack&lt;T, TStackBeneath&gt;&gt; Push(T x);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've created straightforward implementations <code>EmptyStack&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>NonEmptyStack&lt;T,TStackBeneath&gt;</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Update #1:</strong> See the code below.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've noticed the following things about their runtime performance: </p>

<ul>
<li>Pushing 1,000 items onto an <code>EmptyStack&lt;int&gt;</code> for the first time takes more than 7 seconds.</li>
<li>Pushing 1,000 items onto an <code>EmptyStack&lt;int&gt;</code> takes virtually no time at all afterwards.</li>
<li>Performance gets exponentially worse the more items I push onto the stack.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Update #2:</strong></em></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p><em>I've finally performed a more precise measurement. See the benchmark code and results below.</em></p></li>
  <li><p><em>I've only discovered during these tests that .NET 3.5 doesn't seem to allow generic types with a recursion depth &ge; 100. .NET 4 doesn't seem to have this restriction.</em></p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The first two facts make me suspect that the slow performance is not due to my implementation, but rather to the type system: .NET has to instantiate 1,000 distinct closed generic <em>types</em>, ie.:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>EmptyStack&lt;int&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>NonEmptyStack&lt;int, EmptyStack&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>NonEmptyStack&lt;int, NonEmptyStack&lt;int, EmptyStack&lt;int&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>NonEmptyStack&lt;int, NonEmptyStack&lt;int, NonEmptyStack&lt;int, EmptyStack&lt;int&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Is my above assessment correct?</li>
<li>If so, why does instantiation of generic types such as <code>T&lt;U&gt;</code>, <code>T&lt;T&lt;U&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>T&lt;T&lt;T&lt;U&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, and so on get <em>exponentially</em> slower the deeper they are nested? </li>
<li>Are CLR implementations other than .NET (Mono, Silverlight, .NET Compact etc.) known to exhibit the same characteristics?</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><sup><strong>&dagger;</strong>)</sup> Off-topic footnote: These types are quite interesting btw. because they allow the compiler to catch certain errors such as:</em></p>

//                    ^^^^^^

<h2>Update #2: Benchmark code and results</h2>

<p>I used the following code to measure recursive generic type instantiation times for .NET 4 on a Windows 7 SP 1 x64 (Intel U4100 @ 1.3 GHz, 4 GB RAM) notebook. This is a different, faster machine than the one I originally used, so the results do not match with the statements above.</p>

<pre><code>Console.WriteLine(""N, t [ms]"");
int outerN = 0;
while (true)
{
    outerN++;
    var appDomain = AppDomain.CreateDomain(outerN.ToString());
    appDomain.SetData(""n"", outerN);
    appDomain.DoCallBack(delegate {
        int n = (int)AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetData(""n"");
        var stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
        stopwatch.Start();
        IStack&lt;int&gt; s = new EmptyStack&lt;int&gt;();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
        {
            s = s.Push(i);  // &lt;-- this ""creates"" a new type
        }
        stopwatch.Stop();
        long ms = stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds;
        Console.WriteLine(""{0}, {1}"", n, ms);
    });
    AppDomain.Unload(appDomain);
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Each measurement is taken in a separate app domain because this ensures that all runtime types will have to be re-created in each loop iteration.)</p>

<p>if you click on the <code>li</code> it sets the language and start the function:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;ul id=""langSelect""&gt;
  &lt;li lang=""de""&gt;German&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

<p>another solution might be to similate a user click on the li command, but I am also not sure how to do this!</p>

I'm using the form-data input type in the PostMan chrome plugin and it can get data created into the DB but when I try to structure the raw API the post is successful but it doesn't identify the values (and therefore inserts a blank record into the DB).</p>

<p>My controller code:</p>

<pre><code>        def create
            @newProduct = Product.new
            if @newProduct.create(product_params)
                render json: {error: ""Product created""}
            else
                render json: {error: ""Product failed to create""}
            end
        end

        def product_params
            params.require(:product).permit(:name, :brand)
        end
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried the following</p>

<pre><code>    {""brand""=&gt;""wut"",
     ""name""=&gt;""asdasd""}

    [
    {
    ""name"":""name1"", 
    ""brand"" : ""brand""
    }
    ]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Using:</p>

<pre><code>{ ""product""=&gt;{""name""=&gt;""some name"", ""brand""=&gt;""some brand""} } 
</code></pre>

<p>and the following controller:</p>

<pre><code>    def create
        @newProduct = Product.create(params[:product])
        if @newProduct.save
            render json: {message: ""Product created""}
        else
            render json: {error: ""Product failed to create""}
        end
    end

    private

    def product_params
        params.require(:product).permit(:name, :brand)
    end
</code></pre>

<p>I still get empty records being entered</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

Most of it I can handle without the use of JS and still have a functioning site, however there is one bit that is eluding me. (note, I'm using ASP.NET MVC but that shouldn't matter in this instance)</p>

<p>I have an input field that is making great use of jQuery-UI AutoComplete.  The behavior is very simple. The user is asked to input their City, but is given an  AutoComplete list of valid cities.  If the city is invalid, the server side validation fires and tells them to try again.</p>

<p>If they do select a valid city, the jQuery method updates a hidden field that contains the CityID of the selected city.  This is working phenomenally well, and I really like the performance.</p>

<p>Here's where the problem enters.  If JS is not available in the browser, the ID field is not updated, and hence the DB is not updated.  I am not using the AutoComplete input on the server side at all, just the ID field.  What would be a good solution to circumvent this issue?</p>

I do apologize because I know this is css basics but I really want to understand that and get a good explanation.

Here is my page :

<p>I just want to resize the second div at the right. When I look at it in the Chrome Developer Tools, I see that this div begins at the top left of the window and not after the red square. I'd like it to begins just after the red square to change the width properly without calculating the size of the square and doing something like </p>

<pre><code>width = square size + width i want

<p>Do you know how this it happens and how to properly resize the width of the second div ?  </p>

<p>EDIT: the <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/1867ud9p/10/"" rel=""nofollow"">solution</a> consists in add the float property to the second div too. The explanation is the following : floated elements are removed from the flow, so they don't stack with the non-floated elements.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are hosting a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service at
  h ttp://www.contoso.com for a law enforcement agency. The agency adds
  operations to support sending biometric fingerprint data via
  non-buffered streaming. The service data is routed between
  intermediaries. The WCF binding you are using by default does not
  support encryption. You need to ensure that the fingerprint data is
  not disclosed when passed over the network. What should you do?</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A. Use basicHttpBinding with message security to https:// www.contoso.com</li>
  <li>B. Use basicHttpBinding with transport security to https:// www.contoso.com</li>
  <li>C. Use wsHttpBinding with message security to https:// www.contoso.com</li>
  <li>D. Use wsHttpBinding with transport security to http:// www.contoso.com</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer is B. But I think here it says ""The service data is routed between intermediaries"", so message security should be favour over transport security. Well, it did say ""The WCF binding you are using by default does not support encryption"", but the options here do offer using wsHttpBinding, so I think both A and C will do. Can anyone tell what I'm wrong there? Thanks.</p>

<p>The <code>LZWDecode</code> algorithm that is part of the <a href=""http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/pdf/PDFReference13.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">PDF standard</a> requires all images to have a minimum LZW code size of 8-bits, and <code>PDF::Create</code> is hard-coded to only embed 8-bit images.</p>

<p>So far, I have adapted the <a href=""http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/MARKUSB/PDF-Create-1.06/lib/PDF/Image/GIF.pm"" rel=""nofollow"">image loader</a> from <code>PDF::Create</code> to read a 5-bit image and to fully decode the LZW stream. I am then able to use the encoder algorithm from <code>PDF::Create</code> to re-pack the image as 8-bit.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is to eliminate the memory-intensive decode/encode step. <a href=""http://forums.adobe.com/thread/285529"" rel=""nofollow"">This thread</a> suggests that this is possible by ""widening or shifting bits"" to make LZW codes the proper length for <code>LZWDecode</code>.</p>

<p>I contacted the thread author and he provided some additional details, in particular that codes for color indices remain the same but are padded with zeros (e.g., <code>[10000]</code> becomes <code>[000010000]</code>), that <code>&lt;Clear&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;End&gt;</code> codes are changed to <code>&lt;256&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;257&gt;</code> respectively, and that all other codes are offset by 256 - original <code>&lt;Clear&gt;</code> code.</p>

<p>However, he was unable to elaborate further due to restrictions by his employer. In particular, I am uncertain how to handle a code when its modified value exceeds <code>&lt;4095&gt;</code> (the maximum index for the LZW code table). I am also unsure how to re-pack the revised codes into a bitstream.</p>

<p>The algorithms I am currently using are below.</p>

<p>The normal mapping seems to work perfectly on objects that have a model matrix close to the identity matrix. As long as I start translating and scaling, my lighting seems off. As you can see in the picture the normal mapping works perfectly on the container cube, but the lighting fails on the large floor (direction of the specular light should be towards the player, not towards the container).</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/uuNSt.jpg"" alt=""Lighting not working on Normal mapping""></p>

<p>I get the feeling it somehow has something to do with the position of the light (currently traversing from x = -10 to x = 10 over time) not properly being included in the calculations as long as I start changing the model matrix (via translations/scaling). I'm posting all the relevant code and hope you guys can somehow see something I'm missing since I've been staring at my code for days.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
I now loaded my objects using the ASSIMP library with the 'aiProcess_CalcTangentSpace' flag enabled and changed my shaders accordingly to adapt to the new changes. Since ASSIMP now automatically calculates the correct tangent vectors I should have valid tangent vectors and my problem should be solved (as noted by Nicol Bolas), but I still have the same issue with the specular lighting acting strange and the diffuse lighting not really showing up. I guess there is still something else that is not working correctly. I unmarked your answer as the correct answer Nicol Bolas (for now) and updated my code accordingly since there is still something I'm missing.</p>

<p>It probably has something to do with translating. As soon as I add a translate (-22.0f in y direction) to the Model matrix it reacts with strange lighting. As long as the floor (which is actually a cube) has no translation the lighting looks fine.</p>

Perhaps it could be informative to others as well.</p>

<p>The least painful, magic solution is that I had to add the below function call to the very end of my front controller (the main index.php) file:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#dialog-areyousuremodal"").dialog({
    resizable: false,
    height: 120,
    modal: true,
    buttons: {
        ""Yes"": function() {
            $(this).dialog(""close"");
            // more stuff coming soon
            },
        ""No"": function() {
            $(this).dialog(""close"");
        }
    }
}).end().centerFixed();

&lt;div class=""hidden"" id=""dialog-areyousuremodal"" title=""Delete Confirmation""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you sure you want to delete this row?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And I have created a custom function that extends jquery like this:</p>

<pre><code>(function($){
    $.fn.extend({
        centerFixed: function () {
            return this.each(function() {
            $(this).end();
            $(this).css({position:""fixed""});
            $(this).css(""top"", (($(window).height() - $(this).outerHeight()) / 2) + ""px"");
            $(this).css(""left"", (($(window).width() - $(this).outerWidth()) / 2) + ""px"");
            });
        }
    });
})(jQuery);
</code></pre>

<p>My goal is to replace .end().centerFixed(); with just .centerFixed();. As you can see I tried putting .end() inside the custom function but that does not work. I'm tried to avoid having to put .end() at the end of the dialog or .centerFixed() on a new line.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on the matter?</p>

<p>vertex:</p>

<pre><code>#version 330 core
out vec2 vfTexCoords;

const float halfSide = 1.0f;
const vec2[] pos = vec2[ 4 ]
(
    vec2( -halfSide, -halfSide ),
    vec2(  halfSide, -halfSide ),
    vec2(  halfSide,  halfSide ),
    vec2( -halfSide,  halfSide )
);

const vec2[] tex = vec2[ 4 ]
(
    vec2( 0.0f, 0.0f ),
    vec2( 1.0f, 0.0f ),
    vec2( 1.0f, 1.0f ),
    vec2( 0.0f, 1.0f )
);

void main()
{
    vfTexCoords = tex[ gl_VertexID ];
    gl_Position = vec4( pos[ gl_VertexID ], 0.0f, 1.0f );
}
</code></pre>

<p>fragment:</p>

<pre><code>in vec2 vfTexCoords;

layout (location = 0) out vec3 pos;

void main()
{
    pos = vec3( vfTexCoords, 0.0f );
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output 2D float texture is resized to the dimensions of the rectangular vertices mesh and is bind it to one of the color attachments of the FBO. Thus the FBO size is inherited from the texture size.</p>

<p>The viewport is setup to have the same dimensions as the size of the rectangular mesh:</p>

<pre><code>glViewport( 0, 0, horizontalVerticesCount, verticalVerticesCount );
</code></pre>

<p>So, now both the viewport and the texture have the same size and after:</p>

<pre><code>glDrawArrays( GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, 0, 4 );
</code></pre>

<p>... the output vertices' positions should range from vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) to vec3(1.0, 1.0, 0.0), since texture coords vary from 0.0, 0.0 to 1.0, 1.0.</p>

<p>What is strange is that the x and y values of the output vertex positions from the fragment shader start from non-zero and their max value is below 1.0.
For a 2 x 2 mesh:
bottom-left: vec3( 0.25, 0.25, 0.0 ) ( 0.5 / mesh_side = 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 ) 
top-right: vec3( 0.75, 0.75, 0.0 )</p>

<p>For a 16 x 16 mesh:
bottom-left: vec3( 0.03125, 0.03125 , 0.0 ) ( 0.5 / mesh_side = 0.5 / 16 = 0.03125 ) 
top-right: vec3( 0.96875, 0.96875, 0.0 )</p>

<p>Having the vertex shader positions set from vec3(-1.0, -1.0, 0.0) to vec3(1.0, 1.0, 0.0) should mean that I am ""drawing"" over the entire viewport.
Modifying the vertex shader's positions results in different output values from the fragment shader.</p>

<p>What is wrong with the code above and why the drawing starts from 0.5 / rect_mesh_side_length?</p>

As I mentioned in this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18947088/socketexception-connection-reset-on-server-with-objectinputstream"">question</a>, I was getting a SocketException: Connection reset.<br>
After implemented Aaron's answer it seems to be working as intended. But today that I run the code again, I got once again the connection reset error.<br>
The problem is that if I run my code like 5 times, it seems to work 2/5 times and the rest gives me the error...</p>

<p>Server:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class Server {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {       
            ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(444);
            while (true) {
                Socket socket = server.accept();
                ObjectInputStream objIn = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
                Object objRead = objIn.readObject();
                if (objRead != null) {
                    System.out.println(objRead);
                }
            }       
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Client:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>import java.io.*;
import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.Socket;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Client {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Socket sock;
        int port = 444;
        HashMap&lt;Integer, String&gt;  mapSend= new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
        mapSend.put(1,""row1"");
        mapSend.put(2,""row2"");

        sock = new Socket(InetAddress.getLocalHost(), port);
        ObjectOutputStream objOut = new ObjectOutputStream(sock.getOutputStream());

        objOut.writeObject(mapSend);
        objOut.flush();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the error: (it appears on the output of the server, after I run the client):</p>

<p>On the client side I get no errors.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong><br>
Any way I can debug the client-server? That might help out to give you guys more info on this.</p>

After cache flush and many reloads , website starts working fine again.
I was using CSS and JS merging option but now I disabled it but still , I am facing this error.
Did anyone here ever face such error before? Or any idea how to solve this bug? I am really stuck over it.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>class A is java and is similar to</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Table(name = ""A"")
public class A {
  @ManyToOne
  @JoinColumn(name = ""BId"")
  private bType b;

  public bType getB() {
    return this.b;
  }
  public void setB(bType b) {
    this.b = b;
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>class b is scala and is similar to</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Table(name = ""B"")
class B(
  @(OneToMany@field@Transient)(mappedBy = ""b"") private var _allAs: java.util.set[A] = Sets.newHashSet[A]()
) {
  def allAs:Set[A] = {
    _allAs.asScala.toSet
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>so A can have one B but it won't always. B can have many A's but it won't necessarily have any.</p>

<p>what I want is this</p>

<ul>
<li>if I get a B I want _allAs to be automatically populated with the set of A's that have   that particular B.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently with the setup above everything seems to work accept _allAs never gets populated with anything.</p>

<p>You should also not be able to adjust _allAs through B, if you want to set the b property for an A you have to do it through that A</p>

<p>I am not very familiar with any of these technologies unfortunately so it could be something really obvious that I am missing</p>

<p>edit: also @Transient is there because I really don't need that set persisted in any way I just want to get its population for free which I believe is possible</p>

<p>thanks in advance</p>

<p>If they do the same thing, is one method faster than the other? If so, it would make sense to use that method.</p>
