<p>In a Swift project, I have a function that parses out a string that I know will be presented in a specific format and uses it to fill in some instance variables. </p>

<p>There is a helper function that is passed the string, a starting index, and a divider character and spits out a tuple made up of the next string and the index from which to continue. Just in case a poorly formatted string gets passed in, I define a return type of (String, Int)? and return nil if the divider character isn't found.</p>

<p>The helper function looks, in relevant part, like this:</p>

<pre><code>   func nextChunk(stringArray: Array&lt;Character&gt;, startIndex: Int, divider: Character) -&gt; (String, Int)?
    {

    [...]

 var returnValue: (String, Int)? = (returnString, i)
        return returnValue
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So far, so good. I set a breakpoint, and just before the function returns, I see that all is as it should be:</p>

<pre><code>(lldb) po returnValue
(0 = ""21三體綜合症"", 1 = 7)
 {
  0 = ""21三體綜合症""
  1 = 7
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's what I expected to see: the correct string value, and the correct index.</p>

<p>However, when I go back to the init() function that called the helper in the first place, and put a breakpoint immediately after the call:</p>

<pre><code>var returnedValue = self.nextChunk(stringArray, startIndex: stringArrayIndex, divider: "" "")
</code></pre>

<p>I get a completely different value for returnedValue than I had for returnValue:</p>

<pre><code>(lldb) po returnedValue
(0 = ""I"", 1 = 48)
 {
  0 = ""I""
  1 = 48
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now here's the <em>really</em> weird part. After I get the return value, I want to test to see if it's nil, and if it's not, I want to use the values I fetched to set a couple of instance variables:</p>

<pre><code>    if(returnedValue == nil)
    {
        return
    }
    else
    {
        self.traditionalCharacter = returnedValue!.0
        stringArrayIndex = returnedValue!.1
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If I comment out both of the lines in the ""else"" brackets:</p>

<pre><code>    else
    {
        // self.traditionalCharacter = returnedValue!.0
        // stringArrayIndex = returnedValue!.1
    }
</code></pre>

<p>then my original breakpoint gives the expected value for the returned tuple:</p>

<pre><code>(lldb) po returnedValue
(0 = ""21三體綜合症"", 1 = 7)
 {
  0 = ""21三體綜合症""
  1 = 7
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again: the breakpoint is set <em>before</em> this if/else statement, so I'm taking the value before any of this code has had the chance to execute.</p>

<p>After banging my head against this for a few hours, I realize that...there isn't actually a problem. If I press the ""step over"" button in the debugger, the execution pointer jumps back from the if() line to the call to nextChunk. Pressing it again sends it forward to ""if"" again, and sets the values properly.</p>

<p>This extra double-jump only happens if the assignment code is active, consistently and reproducibly. As I know, since I reproduced it for hours trying to figure out what was wrong before even trying stepping forward and noticing that it ""fixed itself.""</p>

<p>So my question is: why? Is this a bug in the debugger, or am I using breakpoints wrong? It happens just the same whether I put the breakpoint between the function call and the if() or on the if() line. Can someone explain why the debugger is jumping back and forth and when the value I need is actually getting set?</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t *buf = calloc(65, sizeof(uint8_t));

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Looks like this issue may be specific to char * (or uint8_t <em>) arguments. Objective C @encodes them as '</em>' and OCMock's type handling code only treats '^'-encoded values as pointers. I've tried hacking <code>+[OCMArg resolveSpecialValues:]</code> and <code>-[NSInvocation getArgumentAtIndexAsObject:]</code> (in NSInvocation+OCMAdditions.m) to treat '*' the same as '^'. This has stopped the exception, but my expectation is still not met.</p>

Then the user clicks on a button to play a game.  So the application seque-switches to the other viewcontroller, <strong>PlayViewController</strong>, which shows the game play with <strong>SKView</strong>.  And <strong>ActionScene</strong> is an <strong>SKScene</strong> subclass that is responsible for the game play.  When the user fails, the application will display a label (SKLabelNode) and ask if he or she wants to quit the game.  If the user taps this label, the gamer will be brought back to the main view controller (UIViewController) via PlayViewController.  So I figure that ActionScene should delegate this task to PlayViewController.  The following comes from ActionScene.</p>

<pre><code>// ActionScene.h
#import &lt;SpriteKit/SpriteKit.h&gt;

@protocol actionDelegate;
@interface ActionScene : SKScene

@property (weak) id &lt;actionDelegate&gt; delegate;
@end

@protocol actionDelegate &lt;NSObject&gt;
@required

// Delegate
- (void)closeScene;
@end

// ActionScene.m
- (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    for (UITouch *touch in touches) {
    SKNode *n = [self nodeAtPoint:[touch locationInNode:self]];
        if (n != self &amp;&amp; [n.name isEqual: @""doneLabel""]) { // It was else if before.  I've made a change.
            [[self childNodeWithName:@""doneLabel""] removeFromParent]; // The user chooses to end the game by tapping doneLabel (SKLabelNode)
            [self.delegate closeScene];
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As for PlayViewController, it's responsible for presenting ActionScene to SKView and also sending the user back to UIViewController as follows.</p>

<pre><code>// PlayViewController.h
#import ""ActionScene.h""

@interface PlayViewController : UIViewController &lt;actionDelegate&gt;
@property (strong,nonatomic) ActionScene *actionScene;

@end

// PlayViewController.m
- (void)viewWillLayoutSubviews {
    SKView *spriteView = [[SKView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];
    [self.view addSubview:spriteView];

    SKScene *scene = [[ActionScene alloc] initWithSize:spriteView.frame.size];
    [self.actionScene setDelegate:self]; // Letting ActionScene delegate a task to itself
    [spriteView presentScene:scene];
}

- (void)closeScene {
    // It doesn't get a call from ActionScene
}
</code></pre>

<p>So when the user taps the done label, closeScene is designed to kick in.  But this delegate method never gets a call.  I haven't developed an iOS application for the past 9 months.  But I think I have the right idea.  What am I doing wrong?  So far, I've read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21916702/go-back-to-view-controller-from-skscene"">this topic</a>, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21920308/how-to-dismiss-skscene"">this topic</a> and others.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>// Additional explainations //</p>

<ol>
<li>All actions are removed before the user gets to tap doneLabel.</li>
<li>The game application will enter touchBegan.  Yet, it'll skip the [spriteView presentScene:scene] line.</li>

<p>in application.properties. This facility is provided by Spring Boot itself. Now the check is working properly. The question is, how do I handle the exception and return a message to the user that he can understand ?</p>

<p>I wrote a method within my Controller, where I intend to handle the MultipartException, using <code>@ExceptionHandler</code>. It does not seem to work.</p>

    applicationErrorDto.setMessage(""File size exceeded"");

    return applicationErrorDto;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Update 2----------</p>

<p>After @luboskrnac pointed it out, I have managed to come up with a solution. We can use <code>ResponseEntityExceptionHandler</code> here to handle this particular case. I believe, we could also have used <code>DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver</code>, but <code>ResponseEntityExceptionHandler</code> will allow us to return a <code>ResponseEntity</code>, as opposed to the former, the methods of which will return <code>ModelAndView</code>. I <strong>have not</strong> tried it though.</p>

<p>This is the final code that I'm using to handle the <code>MultipartException</code> :</p>

<pre><code>@ControllerAdvice
public class CustomResponseEntityExceptionHandler extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {

private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(CustomResponseEntityExceptionHandler.class);

@ExceptionHandler(MultipartException.class)
@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE)

    applicationErrorDto.setMessage(""File size exceeded"");
    LOGGER.error(""File size exceeded"",exception);
    return applicationErrorDto;

}

<p>I am using Swagger for developing/documenting REST Apis. This is the response upon uploading a file that exceeds the size.

I'm trying to determine what database structure (mssql2005) I should use for the tables that hold data for each of the modules.  The two options that I've thought of are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put all the tables into one big database and prefix the tables according to the module.</li>
<li>Separate the tables for each module into different databases.</li>
</ol>

<p>I do have data that is common to all modules, so if I use solution 2 I'm not sure how to manage that common data (such as users).</p>

<p>-- </p>

<p>To clarify one thing, These modules would potentially be sold separately and the configuration settings are something that are not controlled by the client.  This is why I am even considering breaking them into separate tables.</p>

<p>Now I encountered a problem because my base repository class looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IDatabaseFactory&lt;C&gt; : IDisposable
{
    C Get();
    void Set(string connectionString);
}

public abstract class Repository&lt;C, T&gt; : IRepository&lt;T&gt; 
                                         where C : DbContext, IBaseContext 
                                         where T : class, IEntity
{
    protected readonly IDbSet&lt;T&gt; dbset;
    private C dataContext;

    protected Repository(IDatabaseFactory&lt;C&gt; databaseFactory)
    {
        this.DatabaseFactory = databaseFactory;
        this.dbset = DataContext.Set&lt;T&gt;();
    }

    protected IDatabaseFactory&lt;C&gt; DatabaseFactory
    {
        get;
        private set;
    }

    protected C DataContext
    {
        get { return dataContext ?? (dataContext = DatabaseFactory.Get()); }
    }

    public virtual void Add(T entity)
    {
        dbset.Add(entity);
    }

    //etc...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I obviously need the DbContext constraint on type C. However, if I do so, I get errors on dataContext because it cannot resolve C in DbContext.</p>

<p>How can I overcome this problem?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>A typical repository looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public interface ICustomerTypeRepository : IRepository&lt;CustomerType&gt; { }

public class CustomerTypeRepository : Repository&lt;IBaseContext, CustomerType&gt;, ICustomerTypeRepository
{
    public CustomerTypeRepository(IDatabaseFactory&lt;IBaseContext&gt; databaseFactory)
        : base(databaseFactory) { }
}
</code></pre>

<p>After the changes suggested below, I still get the same errors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The type 'IBaseContext' cannot be used as type parameter 'TContext' in the generic type or method 'Repository'. There is no implicit reference conversion from 'IBaseContext' to 'System.Data.Entity.DbContext'.</p>

I think the main reason I'm losing interest is the absence of the main reason I like Javascript and PHP, which is the overall portability that allows development, hosting and testing on any platform (I have Windows 7, Mac OS X and Linux). Coming up with a project - and therefore staying interested in the language - is much easier when I'm able to use it everywhere. </p>

<p>That said, my question is as simple as a request for information on cross platform languages (Java? C++?, * ), or perhaps some suggestions as to projects or methods that may keep me interested in a language long enough to actually be able to start making functional applications.</p>

<p>For clarification I'm looking for overall knowledge of a language rather than a specific API or Toolkit. From there I could learn toolkits, external libraries and other things as I progressed.

<p>and I changed the logon user for the service so that it runs under an account that is part of the Administators group.</p>

<p>I'm able to start the service just fine but I can't get it to stop properly.  By ""properly"" I mean when I stop the service, I get the Service Control dialog that says:</p>

<p>""Windows is attempting to stop the following service on the local computer""</p>

<p>Watching the JBoss log file I can see that JBoss shuts down properly and with Task Manager I can see that all the Java.exe processes disappear.  However, the Service Control dialog does not close 'normally'.  It eventually times out and I get another dialog with ""Error 1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely mannger"" and Task Manager shows prunsrv.exe still running.  The service is then hung up in a ""Stopping"" state and I have to use TaskKill to kill the task and reset the service to a state where I can restart it.</p>

<p>When I look in the service.*.log file, I see the following:</p>

<p>Models should contain business logic such as getting a list of customers based on parameters sent from a controller.</p>

<p>Controllers should contain just enough logic to invoke methods within a model to return to a view. </p>

<p>However I see many examples and tutorials where there is logic within the controller such as a query that accesses a db to get a list of products. I was under the impression that the logic should live in a method inside a model. The controller can then invoke this method, rather than containing the actual logic to query the database.</p>

<p>So if I have a <code>ProductController</code> I might have a Index action which returns an Index View, and I would have a <code>ProductModel</code> which would house my logic to display certain products based on a query string(which the <code>ProductController</code> would pass to said model).

<p>I know that <code>hashmap&lt;string,string&gt;</code> will not be able to display images but I have also tried <code>hashmap&lt;string,object&gt;</code>but it doesn't work as well.</p>

<p>I have a Search Edit view which is strongly typed to my Search model class seen below (simplified).
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/cifHN.png"" alt=""Searches and Custodians""></p>

<p>I want to display the custodians that are attributed to the Search being edited in a listbox showing all Custodians, with the current ones selected.</p>

<p>My controller's Get Edit action is thus:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Edit(int id, int searchListId = 0)
{
    if (searchListId != 0)
    {
        Session[""CurrentSearchListID""] = searchListId;  
    }
    ProjectContext mydb = db;
    Search search = Search.Find(mydb, id);

    IEnumerable&lt;SelectListItem&gt; selectedItems =
        from c in Custodian.List(mydb)
        select new SelectListItem
        {
            Selected = (search.Custodians.Contains(c)),
            Text = c.CustodianName,
            Value = c.ToString()
        };

    ViewBag.Custodians = selectedItems;
    return View(search);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And my Views listbox is thus:</p>

<pre><code>        @{
            //List&lt;Kiersted.Keps.BusinessObjects.Custodian&gt; Custodians = ViewBag.Custodians;
            IEnumerable&lt;SelectListItem&gt; SelectedItems = ViewBag.Custodians;
        }

        @Html.ListBox(""Custodians"", SelectedItems);
</code></pre>

<p>This produces a listbox with the Custodians depicted, but none are selected (I have confirmed that several of the SelectListItems accurately describe the custodian as selected.  I have tried using ListBoxFor and it produces the same thing when populated with a MultiSelectList.</p>

<p>Finally I decided to just force it to do what I want, but this does not return selected Custodians on Submit.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""Custodians"" multiple=""multiple"" name=""Custodians""&gt;
@foreach (Kiersted.Keps.BusinessObjects.Custodian cust in Custodians)
{
    if (Model.Custodians.Contains(cust))
    {
    &lt;option value=""@cust.CustodianID"" selected=""selected""&gt;@cust.CustodianName&lt;/option&gt;
    }
    else
    {
    &lt;option value=""@cust.CustodianID"" &gt;@cust.CustodianName&lt;/option&gt;
    }
}
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone know how you are <strong>supposed</strong> to do this?</p>

<p>Edits:</p>

<h1>ListBoxFor example</h1>

<p>OK so after fiddling around with it for a while longer, I have now gotten Custodians selected in the listbox that correspond to the Search Custodians.  Below is the view code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""editor-field""&gt;
    @Html.ListBoxFor(model =&gt; model.Custodians, allCustodians.Select(cust =&gt; new SelectListItem {
                           Text = cust.CustodianName,
                           Value = cust.CustodianID.ToString(),
                           Selected = true}), 
                           new { Multiple = ""multiple"" })
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If I select several more custodians, how do I get them (or their corresponding values rather) back to the control upon submit?</p>

"9786495","1","9786566","","2012-03-20 12:11:40","","5","3293","<p>I'd like to replace the implementation of a method for an object with a block that the user specifies. In JavaScript, this is easily accomplished:</p>

<pre><code>function Foo() {
    this.bar = function(x) { console.log(x) }
}
foo = new Foo()
foo.bar(""baz"")
foo.bar = function(x) { console.error(x) }
foo.bar(""baz"")
</code></pre>

<p>In C# it is also quite easy</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
{
    public Action&lt;string&gt; Bar { get; set; }
    public Foo()
    {
        Bar = x =&gt; Console.WriteLine(x);
    }
}

var foo = Foo.new();
foo.Bar(""baz"");
foo.Bar = x =&gt; Console.Error.WriteLine(x);
foo.Bar(""baz"");
</code></pre>

<p>But how can I do the same in Ruby? I have a solution that stores a lambda in an instance variable and the method calls the lambda, but I don't really like the overhead and syntax</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def initialize
    @bar = lambda {|x| puts x}
  end

  def bar x
    @bar.call x
  end

  def bar= blk
    @bar = blk
  end
end

foo = Foo.new
foo.bar ""baz""
foo.bar= lambda {|x| puts ""*"" + x.to_s}
foo.bar ""baz""
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to have a syntax like that:</p>

<pre><code>foo.bar do |x|
    puts ""*"" + x.to_s
end
foo.bar ""baz""
</code></pre>

<p>I came up with the following code</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def bar x = nil, &amp;blk
    if (block_given?)
      @bar = blk
    elsif (@bar.nil?)
      puts x
    else
      @bar.call x
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>But this is kinda ugly for more than one parameter and still doesn't feel 'right'. I could also define a set_bar method, but i don't like that either :).</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def bar x
    if (@bar.nil?)
      puts x
    else
      @bar.call x
    end
  end

  def set_bar &amp;blk
    @bar = blk
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>So question is: Is there a better way do to do this and if not, what way would you prefer</p>

<p>Edit:
@welldan97's approach works, but i loose the local variable scope, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>prefix = ""*""
def foo.bar x
    puts prefix + x.to_s
end
</code></pre>

<p>doesn't work. I suppose I have to stick with lambda for that to work?</p>

I have added a segmented control with a single option: Sort List. It essentially functions as a UIButton since I set its selectedSegmentIndex to -1 after a sort option has been chosen. I set it up this way due to difficulties with adding a button to the navigation item's titleView. Additionally, a ""Search"" option may be added in an update in the near future and having the segmented control there will make it easier to add. I have done some preliminary testing with the clients and other volunteers, and everybody approves. </p>

<p><strong>My question is ""Will Apple approve the app if it has this segmented control posing as a button? And is it an acceptable design in general?""</strong></p>

<p>I have read the guidelines and other documentation and I can't seem to find anything saying I shouldn't do this but I would like hear your thoughts regarding this and/or any experiences you have had with something similar.</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots to give you a better idea:</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated, thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1</strong>
So I updated dataGridView1_CellContentClick to this and it gets me very close to the behaviour I am looking for.  If I first left click in column 4 <strong>then</strong> right click I get my CMS.  If I left click any other cell in another column then right click the CMS is no longer there.  However I want to be able to just right click a cell in column 4 without having to left click first to create the CMS.</p>

<pre><code>        private void dataGridView1_CellContentClick(object sender, DataGridViewCellEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.ColumnIndex == 4)

<pre><code>runtime error 2448: you cannot assign a value to this object.
</code></pre>

<p>The line of code triggering the error is:  </p>

<pre><code>Me.txtPageTo.Value = numPages  
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the full code of the OnLoad event handler for the form:  </p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Form_Load()
    Dim varPrinter As Printer
    Dim strRowsource As String
    Dim strReport As String

    If Len(Me.OpenArgs) &gt; 0 Then
        strReport = Me.OpenArgs
        Me.Tag = strReport
        For Each varPrinter In Application.Printers
            strRowsource = strRowsource &amp; ""; "" &amp; varPrinter.DeviceName
        Next varPrinter
        Me!cmbPrinter.RowSource = Mid(strRowsource, 3)
        ' first check to see that the report is still open
        If (1 = SysCmd(acSysCmdGetObjectState, acReport, strReport)) Then
            With Reports(strReport).Printer
                Me!cmbPrinter = .DeviceName
                Me!optLayout = .Orientation

            Dim numPages As String
            numPages = Reports(strReport).Pages
            Debug.Print ""numPages = "" &amp; numPages
            TypeName(Me.txtPageTo) 'added this line as a test after
            Me.txtPageTo.Value = numPages
        End If
    End If
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>numPages prints out to equal 0 just before the error is thrown, even though the report should have at least one page.  Also, the error does not get thrown when the form is already open.  The error only gets thrown when the form has to be opened. (Probably because the offending code is in the onload event.)  </p>

<p>When I added TypeName(Me.txtPageTo) , it triggered runtime error 2424: The expression you entered has a field, control, or property name that <em>mydatabasename</em> cant find.  </p>

<p>I think the problem is that I need to set the control source for txtPageFrom and txtPageTo.  But how do I do that?  This form will only be loaded by a vba method that is trying to print a report, so the values for txtPageFrom and txtPageTo will come from the calling method, not from some underlying data table.  (there is no underlying data table for this dialog form.)    </p>

<p>cmbPrinter and optLayout seem to be populating correctly using the code above.  </p>

<p>Can anyone show me how to get past the error messages so that the form loads properly?  </p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>CORRECT, COMPLETE ANSWER:</em></strong>  </p>

<hr>

<p>The answer to this problem was to greatly simplify the code.  The code in the link at the top of this posting is WAY TOO COMPLEX, and tries to reinvent things that are already done well by the tools built into Access and VBA.  I was able to print reports without any of the complicated solutions by simply using the following code in the on-click event of a control on a form associated with the report:  </p>

<pre><code>Private Sub txtPrintReport_Click()
    On Error GoTo Error_Handler
    Dim commNum As Long
    commNum = Me.CommunicationNumber
    Dim strReport As String
    Dim strVarName As String
    strReport = ""rptCommunicationFormForPrinting""
    strVarName = ""CommunicationNumber""
    DoCmd.OpenReport strReport, acViewPreview, , strVarName &amp; "" = "" &amp; commNum, acWindowNormal, acHidden
    DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdPrint
    DoCmd.Close acReport, strReport
Exit_Point:
Exit Sub
Error_Handler:  'this handles the case where user clicks cancel button
    If Err.Number &lt;&gt; 2501 Then
        MsgBox Err.Description, _
        vbExclamation, ""Error "" &amp; Err.Number
    End If
    DoCmd.Close acReport, strReport
End Sub  
</code></pre>

<p>That is all the code that was required.  Much less than the link at the start of this question.  And also much less than the answer below.  I am marking John Bingham's answer as the accepted answer because he clearly worked a lot on this, and I am very grateful for that.  But I ended up solving the problem with A LOT LESS CODE.  My solution does not require the custom dialog form because it uses the Windows print dialog form.  As such, the on load event code in my posting (taken from the link above), is not necessary.</p>

<p>How can I sort an array of objects numerically (by id) then alphabetically (by name)?</p>

<p>The current way is providing invalid output.</p>

<p>This is the object i'm trying to sort through</p>

<pre><code>var items = [
    {
        ""id"": 165,
        ""name"": ""a""
    },
    {
        ""id"": 236,
        ""name"": ""c""
    },
    {
        ""id"": 376,
        ""name"": ""b""
    },
    {
        ""id"": 253,
        ""name"": ""f""
    },
    {
        ""id"": 235,
        ""name"": ""e""
    },
    {
        ""id"": 24,
        ""name"": ""d""
    },
    {
        ""id"": 26,
        ""name"": ""d""
    }
]
</code></pre>

<p>and the way i'm trying to sort</p>

<pre><code>items.sort(function(a, b) {
    return (a.id - b.id);
}).sort(function(a, b) {
    return (a.name - b.name);
});
</code></pre>

<p>here is the jsfiddle.</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/jh4xb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/jh4xb/</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Sorry for the confusion, I've been so confused by this problem for a while.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to accomplish is to sort by the highest id first, and then sort alphabetically so in the end it should look like:</p>

<pre><code>var items = [
    {
        ""id"": 376,
        ""name"": ""b""
    },
    {
        ""id"": 253,
        ""name"": ""f""
    },
    {
        ""id"": 236,
        ""name"": ""c""
    },
    {
        ""id"": 235,
        ""name"": ""e""
    },
    {
        ""id"": 165,
        ""name"": ""a""
    },
    {
        ""id"": 26,
        ""name"": ""d""
    },
    {
        ""id"": 24,
        ""name"": ""d""

<p>I've included the last log record because I'm not sure if it suggests the HTTP URL where these errors happened, or if it's the URL of the next request the Heroku dyno is processing (we receive hundreds of requests a second so it's a bit crazy to track). </p>

<p>My application (<strong>ExpressJS</strong>) requires receiving large POST requests, which is why I've put </p>

<pre><code>app.use(express.limit('5mb'));
</code></pre>

<p>at the top of the app to allow large post requests (usually less than 2MB). I'm not sure if the errors above are being caused by receiving a request that's too large or trying to send a request to S3 that's too large, or something else. Any ideas?</p>

<pre><code>-View

<p>All of my content is in the contentView. Most of the content is <code>UITextFields</code> that I added programmatically to fashion a form-like setup. I can touch the text fields when I first enter the <code>View Controller</code> to bring up the keyboard to type on them, however, as soon as I scroll down (so I can see the rest of the textfields on the view) none of them respond to touch, even the ones that I could originally see and interact with when I first entered the view controller. There is, however, one button that I added from the storyboard that will continuously accept touch events even after scrolling, but the <code>textfields</code> I added programmatically will not.</p>

<p>I added log statements in gestureRecognizers to deduce that after I move the page down to see the rest of the <code>textFields</code>, only the scrollView picks up taps, and not the <code>contentView</code> underneath it that holds all of the <code>textfields</code>.</p>

For a example: i have ""User"" table with fields ""id"", ""name"" and i have ""UserBanned"" table with fields ""userid"" and ""reason"".
UserBanned.userid - it is link (foreign key) on field User.id.</p>

<p>So, models in hiberante looks like:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Table(name = ""user"")
@DynamicInsert
public class User{
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO, generator = ""user_id_generator"")
    @SequenceGenerator(name = ""user_id_generator"", sequenceName = ""user_id_seq"")
    protected Integer id;

    @Column
    protected Integer name;

    @OneToOne (mappedBy = ""user"", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    protected UserBanned userBanned;
</code></pre>

<p>And UserBanned model:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Table(name = ""userbanned"")
@DynamicInsert
public class UserBanned{

    @Id
    @Column(name=""userid"", unique=true, nullable=false)
    @GeneratedValue(generator=""gen"")
    @GenericGenerator(name=""gen"", strategy=""foreign"", parameters=@Parameter(name=""property"", value=""user""))
    protected Integer userid;

    @Column
    protected String reason;

    @OneToOne
    @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn
    protected User user;
</code></pre>

<p>And it works. I can create new user and banned user with this code:</p>

<pre><code>    User user = new User();
    user.setName(name);
    UserBanned userBanned = new UserBanned ();
    userBanned.setReason(reason);

    user.setUserBanned(userBanned );
    userBanned.setUser(user);

    clientService.store(user);
</code></pre>

<p>But, when i try to do gson.toJson(client) i got stackoverflow error - because Gson can't handle circular references in the serialized data. But my mind cant understand why i have to set User in UserBanned?! Why i can not just have model User?</p>

<p>My question: how i can organize such relationship (One-To-One with foreign key) like User (there are not only UserBanned, but and UserVIP and etc entities) in hibernate?</p>

<p>the code that is supposed to change the color is similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>(pieChart.pieChartSeries.items[i] as PieSeriesItem).fill  = new mx.graphics.SolidColor(0,0.2); // black, almost opaque
</code></pre>

<p>tracing out the results of this appears to apply the color to the particular PieSeriesItem, but the color does not change visually. I checked the AS reference and the fill property is of type iFill and should accept a solidColor instance. (note: I have also tried 0x000000 as a valid color, the first argument of SolidColor takes an uint)</p>

<p>Any thoughts on why the color would not be applied? comments appreciated.</p>

<p>[edit] Since I posted the question originally, I've added a few changes to help clarify the question.</p>

<ol>
<li>I am actually using an MXML component that extends &lt; mx:PieChart > . Originally I was trying to set the color as listed above within an event handler in the main application. What I have done since then was invoke a method in my extended PieChart component, like so:</li>
</ol>

<p>(in main applicaion)</p>

<pre><code>private function someEventHandler(evt:someEvent):void{
    pieChart.setPieSliceColor((pieChart.pieChartSeries.items[i] as PieSeriesItem));

}
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>In the custom pie Component, I have the following method defined:</p>

<p>public setPieSliceColor(item:PieSeiesItem):void{
    item.fill = new mx.graphics.SolidColor(0x0000ff,1);
this.invalidateSeriesStyles();</p>

<p>}</p></li>
</ol>

<p>now the change in color actually occurs, but is not seen until the user moves the  mouse <strong>over</strong> the respective pie slice! It's strange.</p>

<p>Any additional comments are appreciated.</p>

While the default jobs as discussed in microservice literature is from the REQUEST -> RESPONSE nature, our jobs are more or less assignments of semi permanent tasks.</p>

<p>Examples of such tasks</p>

<ul>
<li>Listen on the message queue for data from source X and Y, correlate the data that comes in and store it in Z.</li>
<li>Keep an in-memory buffer that calculates a running average of the past 15 mins of data everytime a new data entry comes in.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently our services are written in PHP. Due to the perceived overhead of PHP processes and connections to the message queue we'd like a single service process to handle multiple of those jobs simultanously.</p>

<p>A chart that hopefully illustrated the setup that we have in our head:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/HHDls.png"" alt=""services_setup""></p>

<ul>
<li>Service Workers are currently deamonized PHP scripts</li>
<li>For the Service Registry we are looking at Zookeeper</li>
</ul>

<p>While Zookeeper (and Curator) do loadbalancing, I did not find anything around distributing permanent jobs (that are updatable, removable, and must be reassigned when a worker dies)</p>

<p>Proposed responsibilities of a Job Manager</p>

<ul>
<li>Knows about jobs</li>
<li>Knows about services that can do these jobs</li>
<li>Can assign jobs to services</li>
<li>Can send job updates to services</li>
<li>Can reassign jobs if a worker dies</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any libraries / tools that can tackle such problems, and can thus function as the Job Manager? Or is this all one big anti pattern and should we do it some other way?</p>

I want only the absolute minimal SIP functionality so I just might be able to fit PJSIP on a small MCU. Of course, it's a VERY ambitious project but I'm gonna give it a try anyway. I just can't seem to wrap my mind around the right operating system for use so I'm gonna spend a good couple weeks on this subject. I'm gonna take a look at FreeRTOS. Any thoughts on the compatibility of FreeRTOS with something like PJSIP?</p>

It's difficult to discern what is relevant, and what is no longer relevant as one discovers documentation about them (official or otherwise), since things have evolved over the last few releases.</p>

<p>I get the basic patterns, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *name;
</code></pre>

<p>I know I should refer to _name if I want to do direct access, but having done the property, I can/should do <code>self.name</code>, and that that will turn into things like <code>[self setName: ...]</code> or <code>[self name]</code> and that I can even implement these to create side effects, and that I get KVO behavior from them.</p>

<p>The new ground I wanted to venture into today, was having a virtual property, so that I can use dot notation when accessing/setting, but that I will define the access/set methods. More specifically, I have an object with the following ""normal"" properties:</p>

<pre><code>@property (strong, nonatomic) NSDate* started;
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSDate* paused;
@property (assign, nonatomic) BOOL repeat;
</code></pre>

<p>I want to add a <code>status</code> property that will return/assign an <code>NSDictionary</code> derived from those values. The ""methods"" part I get how to write:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSMutableDictionary*) status {
    NSMutableDictionary *dict = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
    if (self.started != nil)
        dict[@""started""] = self.started;
    if (self.paused != nil)
        dict[@""paused""] = self.paused;
    if (self.repeat)
        dict[@""repeat""] = @(YES);
    return dict;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>- (void) setStatus: (NSDictionary*) doc {
    self.started = doc[@""started""];
    self.paused = doc[@""paused""];
    self.repeat = doc[@""repeat""] != nil;
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I don't know, is what magic sauce I add where, so that I can just use <code>self.status</code> and <code>self.status = @{}</code>? In iOS 7 / Xcode 5. I don't need this virtual/composite property to be KVO'able.</p>

I have a previous version that was installed using InstallShield (which was overkill) and wanted to move to the simpler VS Setup Proj because I do not require all the control that an .isproj provides.  However, doing a straight install with my new .msi seems to install side by side with the previous version.  Here's what I have found out so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have my product ID</li>
<li>I have written code that will uninstall the previous version through creating a process that uses MsiExec.exe (code will follow)</li>
<li>Tried implementing the custom action to uninstall during setup but it seems you can only have one instance of MsiExec.exe running at a time.</li>
<li>Have been to this post (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/197365/vs-setup-project-uninstall-other-component-on-install), which didnt help.</li>
</ol>

<p>Custom Action code:</p>

<pre><code>        //Exe used to uninstall
        string fileName = ""MsiExec.exe"";

        //Product ID of versions installed using InstallShield
        string productID = ""{DC625BCF-5E7B-4FEF-96DD-3CDBA7FC02C1}"";

        //Use /x for uninstall and use /qn to supress interface
        ProcessStartInfo startInfo = new ProcessStartInfo(fileName, string.Format(""/x{0}"", productID));
        startInfo.WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Normal;
        startInfo.UseShellExecute = false;

        //Start process
        Process uninstallProcess = Process.Start(startInfo);

        uninstallProcess.WaitForExit();

<p>My hope is to eventually deploy my .msi via ClickOnce, so I am hoping for an option that will fit into deployment option.  Currently everything is written in .NET 2.0 and VS 2005, but I do have .NET 4.0 and VS 2010 available to me if there is a new option that works.</p>

<p>The first problem I encounterd was that, for some reason, g++ 4.6 gave me a <code>undefined referece to</code> as soon as I was including the <code>atomic</code> header. Then I switched to g++ 4.8 and the problem was gone. But now, as soon as I'm using a atomic with a vector like that: <code>atomic&lt;vec3&gt;</code>, I get a new problem. This is what g++ says: </p>

<p><code>/usr/include/c++/4.8/atomic|167|error: function ‘std::atomic&lt;_Tp&gt;::atomic() [with _Tp = glm::detail::tvec3&lt;float&gt;]’ defaulted on its first declaration with an exception-specification that differs from the implicit declaration ‘std::atomic&lt;glm::detail::tvec3&lt;float&gt; &gt;::atomic()’|</code></p>

<p>I have no idea how to fix that. I wanted try g++ 4.9 but I don't even know how to get that. Here is a simple code, that crashes on my machine: </p>

<ul>
<li>I have users and rules and teams</li>
<li>a user can be added to 0, 1 or more rules</li>

<li>a rule can be added to one team only, but a team can contain many distinct rules</li>
<li>a rule can contain 0, 1 or more users</li>

<p>Here is the UserEntity class:</p>

    private String username;

    private List&lt;TeamEntity&gt; teams;

    private List&lt;RuleEntity&gt; rules;

    @Column(name = ""username"", nullable = false, unique = true)

      (name=UserEntity.USER_ID, referencedColumnName=""ID"", insertable = true, updatable = false, nullable = false),

      ...
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So, given I have the following model created:</p>

<pre><code> /**
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *                 Team (""team1"")
 *                       |
 *                  Rule (""rule1"")
 *                       |            |
 *                   User (""john"")
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 */

 /**
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *              Team (""team4"")
 *                    |          
 *              Team (""team5"")
 *               |           |
 *     Rule (""rule4"")       Rule (""rule5"")
 *                          |            |
 *                User (""paul"")        User(""john"")
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 */
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to implement a search whereby a user can search using a username, a team name and a rule name, i..e so the 3 have to match in order to return any results. I currently have the following to return users matching the 3 search terms:</p>

<pre><code>select distinct users from UserEntity as users inner join users.rules as rules inner join users.teams as teams where users.username like :john and rules.ruleName like :rule1 and teams.name like :team5
</code></pre>

<p>So using the HQL query above, I would expect the result to return no user entities (because there is no team5 with a rule1 in it, where the rule1 has john in it), but instead it is returning 'John'</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to tweak the above query so that it works as I've described (i.e. it should only return a result when all 3 match)?</p>

<p>I don't get what is happening with <code>count()</code>. I think that <code>count(.)</code> means <code>count(self::product)</code>, which is always 1, and the pipe operator (|) adds the first node that matches the key, but shouldn't the key 'products-by-category' always return a node-set, given that product has the 'category' attribute and therefore match itself?</p>

<p>I was trying to get my head around the <code>async/await</code> syntax but I just don't get it.</p>

<p>Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>public PewPew SomeMethod(Foo foo)
{
    var cats = GetAllTheCats(foo);
    var food = GetAllTheFood(foo);

    return new PewPew
               {

}

private IList&lt;Cat&gt; GetAllTheCats(Foo foo)
{
    // Do stuff, like hit the Db, spin around, dance, jump, etc...
    // It all takes some time.
    return cats;
}

private IList&lt;Food&gt; GetAllTheFood(Foo foo)
{
    // Do more stuff, like hit the Db, nom nom noms...
    // It all takes some time.
    return food;
}

<p>So with that code above, I want to say : go and get all the cats and food at the same time. Once we're finished, then return a new <code>PewPew</code>.</p>

<p>I'm confused because I'm not sure which classes above are <code>async</code> or return a <code>Task</code>, etc. All of em? just the two private ones? I'm also guessing I need to leverage the <code>Task.WaitAll(tasks)</code> method, but I'm unsure how to <em>setup</em> the tasks to run at the same time.</p>

<p>I have a meteor package that needs to dynamically include a list of assets. 
the <code>fs.readdirSync</code> command needs a full path it seems.</p>

<p>when running the package inside an app, things are fine, as the path to the package is easily deduced. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>  var path = Npm.require(""path"");
  var fs = Npm.require(""fs"");

  // normally found inside an app/packages dir like:
  var packagePath = path.join(path.resolve("".""), ""packages"", ""reactive-ace"");  
  var srcPath = path.join(packagePath, ""vendor"", ""ace"", ""src"")  // files rel to package root
  var files = fs.readdirSync(srcPath);

  files.forEach(function(file){
    console.log(""add_file"", file)
    if (file === ""snippets""){return;}
    addPath = path.join(""vendor"", ""ace"", ""src"", file);
    api.add_files(addPath, ""client"", {isAsset: true});
  });
</code></pre>

<p>However, when i am local developing, using $PACKAGE_DIRS - the package repo is actually somewhere remote on my system. But I'm unable to deduce this just from the package.js</p>

<p>I tried <code>__dirname</code> and also <code>require.main.filename</code> but these both are unknown in the context of building a meteor package.</p>

<p>My current hack involves parsing <code>process.env.PACKAGE_DIRS</code> but that is ugly.</p>

<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>I am using <code>sqlite3</code>. the <code>?</code> represent the input variables.</p>

<p>1- For every entity <code>x</code> in table <code>entite</code> we want to select its variations <code>y</code></p>

<pre><code>SELECT e.id, e.name, v.name FROM var_entite ve 
       JOIN entite as e ON e.id_entite = ve.id_entite 
       JOIN variations as v ON v.id = ve.id_var;
</code></pre>

<p>2- For every <strong>selected</strong> entity in the previous query we<strong>select</strong> all the <strong>rest</strong> entities having the same varitions.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT e.id, e.name, v.name FROM var_entite ve 
       JOIN entite as e ON e.id = ve.id 
       JOIN variations as v ON v.id = ve.id_var
       where e.id &lt;&gt; ? and v.name =? ;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p><code>e.id_entite &lt;&gt; ?</code> for the rest of entities having a different entity from query 1</p></li>
<li><p><code>v.name =?</code> if an entity has the same variation as the one returned in <strong>1</strong> then we select it</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My questions are the following:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>How can we combine these 2 queries in order to get the same results?</li>
<li>If we combine the queries will the querying become faster?</li>
</ul>

<p>Query 2 outputs for entity with <strong>id = 1</strong></p>

<pre><code>    2,x2,y1

<p>Recently, my script periodically hangs up when starting a session when run in debugger mode.  To troubleshoot it, I cancelled the script, and ran the following script which is located directly in <code>/var/www/html/main/testing</code>, and it just hangs when it gets to <code>session_start();</code>.  My PHP and Apache error log files show nothing.  Restarting Apache temporarily fixes it until I try to run the main script again in debug mode.  I've rebooted the client and server, and ran the PhpED project setup script, but the problem persists.  Changing the name of the session cookie allows it not to hang, but obviously this is not a solution.  <code>session_get_cookie_params()</code> shows it as being a normal non-secure cookie.</p>

<p>What might be causing this, and what are the recommended troubleshooting steps?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$cookie=print_r($_COOKIE,1);;

After the update, my <code>ParseBatchRequestsAsync</code> is called once for the original POST to the $batch endpoint, then receives a message that ""The batch request must have 'multipart/mixed' as the media type.""</p>

<p>When I then add an override to the <code>ProcessBatchAsync</code> method in the handler, and set a break in my original project with the June nightly build, I see this method only called once, which then calls the parse routine, all successfully.</p>

<p>When I do this in the July version, I see <code>ProcessBatchAsync</code> called once for the original POST to $batch, then the parse, returning the subrequests. When the subrequests are executed, I see another call to <code>ProcessBatchAsync</code>, which hits the validate routine and fails as the subrequest is not a batch, but a create/change request to an entity end point.</p>

<p>Here is what I can provide so far:</p>

<p>My batch handler looks like:</p>

            requests.Add(New ChangeSetRequestItem(changeSetRequests))

        ElseIf batchReader.State = ODataBatchReaderState.Operation Then

            Dim operationRequest As HttpRequestMessage = Await batchReader.ReadOperationRequestAsync(batchId, bufferContentStream:=True)
            operationRequest.CopyBatchRequestProperties(request)
            requests.Add(New OperationRequestItem(operationRequest))
        End If
    Loop

    Return requests
End Function



End Class
</code></pre>

<p>which was basically and conversion of the source to vb.net and an addition of a replace for content id handling that seemed to fix an issue with relative uri's I was having.</p>

<p>This handler is implemented in my webapiconfig.vb like this:
    config.Routes.MapODataRoute(""odata"", ""odata"", nm.GetEdmModel, New DefaultODataPathHandler, routingConventions, New CustomODataBatchHandler(GlobalConfiguration.DefaultServer))</p>

<p>If I change the requests just to submit one at a time, the controllers are called and the processing completes, so it must be something in the batch handling, likely that I am doing wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Update 07/16/2013</strong>
Changing to the DefaultODataBatchHandler and watching for exceptions on the client side, I saw that the request was rejected with: ""The batch request must have 'multipart/mixed' as the media type.""</p>

<p>When I watch the WCF dataservices client build the request, the POST to $batch has the following headers:</p>

<pre><code>DataServiceVersion: 1.0;NetFx
MaxDataServiceVersion: 3.0;NetFx
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=batch_7b1d426d-dc36-4a6d-9d3d-be2b64b90d38
Accept: multipart/mixed
Accept-Charset: UTF-8
User-Agent: Microsoft ADO.NET Data Services
</code></pre>

<p>I tried setting it back to my handler, and can see that the requests are parsed and returned as a change set. Then the same media type error is returned to my client somewhere in the handler before my controllers are invoked.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>
I took the source for the <code>DefaultODataBatchHandler</code> and used it as a custom batch handler without changing the code. Stepping through, I see the first POST to $batch parses fine, and passes validation. When the change set of subrequests is passed to the <code>ExecuteRequestMessagesAsync</code> and then <code>responses.Add(await request.SendRequestAsync(Invoker, cancellationToken));</code> is called, <code>ProcessBatchRequest</code> is triggered again and attempts to handle the subrequest rather then allowing it to be processed by the controller. This goes into a validate and parse routine again, which fails as this is no longer a batch request, and the content type is now XML since it is the actual entity.</p>

<p>In order to use the Nightly build I removed everything I could find installed for MVC, WebAPI, OData, etc. and then installed all nightly packages. I wanted to include this incase it is something else causing this.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong>
I overrode the ProcessBatchAsync method in my original custom batch handler in my original project and can confirm that ProcessBatchAsync ws only called once when it was working. In the current nightly build it seems the ProcessBatchAsync is called for the original request, and the subrequests. I can't confirm if this is happening only in this project, or in a new project yet.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 4</strong>

<p>When the event type div is showing, any content that is longer than the available space disappears under the edge of the dialog. I would expect this if the it was an iframe, or if the absolutely positioned parent had a higher z-index. However, the jQuery UI dialog is a simple absolutely positioned div with a z-index of 1002 (the default), and my widget's div that displays the event types is an absolutely positioned div that has a z-index of 1003. I would expect that my div would take higher precedence in the stacking order.</p>

<p>I need the menu the be <code>left: 250px;</code>, but it has the <code>width</code> set to <code>100%</code>. Since it is fixed, the page won't scroll (and I don't even want that), but the <code>Text</code> on the right won't show, since the div takes up more space than the page has. I need the div to take up the remaining space on the page. How can I achieve this?</p>

The data is contained in a c# object (see below) and is sent as part of a standard .net event. In real-time, the number of events we typically receive can vary greatly from less than 1/sec to upwards of around 800 events per second per instrument and thus can be very bursty. A typical day might accumulate 5 million rows/elements per insturment</p>

<p>A generic version of the C# event's data structure looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public enum MyType { type0 = 0, type1 = 1}

public class dataObj
{
    public int myInt= 0;
    public double myDouble;
    public string myString;
    public DateTime myDataTime;
    public MyType type;
    public object myObj = null;

}
</code></pre>

<p>We plan to use this data structure in f# in two ways: </p>

<ol>
<li>Historical analysis using supervised &amp;&amp; unsupervised  machine learning (CRFs, clustering models, etc)  </li>
<li>Real-time classification of data streams using the above models</li>
</ol>

<p>The data structure needs to be able to grow as we add more events. This rules out <code>array&lt;t&gt;</code> because it does not allow for resizing, though it could be used for the historical analysis. The data structure also needs to be able to quickly access recent data and ideally needs to be able to jump to data x points back. This rules out <code>Lists&lt;T&gt;</code> because of the linear lookup time and because there is no random access to elements, just ""forward-only"" traversal.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3407772/f-immutable-variable-sized-window-data-structure"">this post</a>, <code>Set&lt;T&gt;</code> may be a good choice...</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3407772/f-immutable-variable-sized-window-data-structure"">> "" ...Vanilla Set&lt;'a> does a more than adequate job. I'd prefer a 'Set' over a 'List' so you always have O(lg n) access to the largest and smallest items, allowing you to ordered your set by insert date/time for efficient access to the newest and oldest items...""</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Yin Zhu response gave me some additional clarity into exactly what I was asking. I have edited the remainder of the post to reflect this. Also, the previous version of this question was muddied by the introduction of requirements for historical analysis. I have omitted them.</p>

<p>Here is a breakdown of the steps of the real-time process: </p>

<ol>
<li>A realtime event is received</li>
<li>This event is placed in a data structure. <strong>This is the data structure that we are trying to determine</strong>. Should it be a <code>Set&lt;T&gt;</code>, or some other structure?</li>
<li>A subset of the elements are either extracted or somehow iterated over for the purpose of feature generation. This would either be the last n rows/elements of the data structure (ie. last 1000 events or 10,000 events) or all the elements in the last x secs/mins (i.e all the events in the last 10 min). Ideally, we want a structure that allows us to do this efficiently. In particular, a data structure that allows for random access of the nth element without iteration through all the others elements is of value.</li>
<li>Features for the model are generated and sent to a model for evaluation.</li>
<li>We may prune the data structure of older data to improve performance.</li>
</ol>

<p>So the question is what is the best data structure to use for storing the real-time streaming events that we will use to generated features.</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
lines=[]
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

    plt.pause(.1)
#ani = animation.ArtistAnimation(fig, im, interval=1000, blit=True,repeat_delay=1000)
plt.show()
</code></pre>

<p>Plus I couldn't make it to work with animation artist! I used draw. What is wrong with the animation lines</p>

<p>Now increasing those 10s to 100 makes the program terribly slow:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
lines=[]
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation

#initial plot
fig=plt.figure()
ax=plt.subplot(1,1,1)
for i in range(100):
    lines.append([])
    for j in range(100):
        lines[i].append(ax.plot([i,j],color='0.8'))
lines=np.asarray(lines)


##Updating the colors 10 times

<p>As I said I want to run it side by side with an animation. Therefore I prefer to make it an animation. I think that would solve the lagging problem at least after the animation starts but right now the way I defined it, it doesn't work.</p>

We have 2 tables, where we take the data: categories and offers.</p>

<p>In Zend_Lucene addition data to index go that way:</p>

<pre><code>/*Code above we create new index and take data from mysql
And here are the old methods:
offer - is array with query results
*/


$to_index = ""{$offer[""name""]} {$offer[""type""]} {$offer[""description""]}"";

 $doc = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Document();
 $doc-&gt;addField( Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::Text('text', $to_index, ""utf-8"") );
 $doc-&gt;addField( Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::Keyword('cat_id', $offer[""cat_id""]) );
 $doc-&gt;addField( Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::Keyword('type', ""offer"") );
 $doc-&gt;addField( Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::Keyword('id', $offer[""id""]) );
 $doc-&gt;addField( Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::UnIndexed('created', time()) );

$this-&gt;index-&gt;addDocument($doc);

/*End of old code*/
</code></pre>

<p>The same methods we have for categories/</p>

<p>In Solr and PHP Solr Client, I've changed that code (using default example schema.xml):</p>

<pre><code>$to_index = ""{$category[""name""]}"";

$doc = new Apache_Solr_Document();
$doc-&gt;text = $to_index;
$doc-&gt;type = ""category"";
$doc-&gt;id = $category[""id""];
$doc-&gt;created = time();

try {
     $this-&gt;solr-&gt;addDocuments($doc);
     $this-&gt;solr-&gt;commit();
     $this-&gt;solr-&gt;optimize();
}
catch ( Exception $e ) {
     echo $e-&gt;getMessage();
}
</code></pre>

<p>But search in index gives me 0! I have a suspicion, that Solr doesn't make proper index. (But there are no bug messages or exeptions during index creation). Also I'd try to give Solr only text and id poles in methods. But result was the same!</p>

<p>What I'm doing wrong? Did I change the Zend_Lucene methods correctly?</p>

<p>So simply put a user would have a tree of data that would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>User -&gt; PersonalData -&gt; FamilyData
     -&gt; ProfessionalData
</code></pre>

<p>As you may have noticed, each of my models uses Mongoid:Timestamps as I want to know when each sub part of the user gets modified.</p>

<p>Now where it gets tricky, is that I want upon creating a new User, that it automatically gets all its embedded model created with it while using the proper callbacks to set the Timestamps.</p>

<p>Ideally I would like to avoid doing multiple writes to the DB, but I haven't found an elegant way of doing this so far.</p>

<p>For the moment I have this in my User model:</p>

<pre><code>after_create :create_personal_data
after_create :create_professional_data 
</code></pre>

<p>And in PersonalData model:</p>

<pre><code>after_create :create_family_data
</code></pre>

<p>However the results are not what I am expecting, it works great for the ProfessionalData model, where it gets created and the TimeStamps callback works, :created_at and :updated_at are set properly.
However for the PersonalData model, it does not work properly:
- the embedded model gets created
- but the callback are not called properly, and TimeStamps are not set
- the embedded FamilyData does not get created un PersonalData</p>

However, the lack of SEO by default, and sometimes some performance issues are a real problem for me. So I've started looking into building isomorphic apps. I checked out these tutorials:</p>

<p><a href=""http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/</a></p>

<p>With my current SPA builds, I have a master index.html file (containing body &amp; head, header, footer, nav and scripts to load), then I have a directory of views which are loaded in using Angular's <code>ng-view</code>. This is VERY easy to maintain the frontend html as all the code for a page will be in a single view file.</p>

<p>However the tutorials I've looked at for isomorphic builds (using React and Flux) split html into modules, each with their own file and mixed into the javascript. I find this very ugly and difficult to maintain. Looking at the code in output file, it's very difficult to see what the resulting page will look like. It doesn't seem very semantic and appears to go back to an old fashioned way of building modular html in PHP applications that some people used to do.</p>

<p>Is there a way to maintain the simple routing and html view structure we've enjoyed from Angular SPAs, whilst having it able to render on the server in an isomorphic way?</p>

<p>Note I'm not looking simply to render the content on the server using something like PhantomJS. I still want the full isomorphic experience, where first hit to a page serves fully rendered content, then subsequent interactions execute javascript on the client side. </p>

I have an opening screen (OpeningScreen) that acts as a splash screen that opens up the menu (MenuScreen).  From there the user can pick to go to the game or go to the activity that shows the current pictures (PickScreen).  The user can go to that activity and from there open up another activity that gives a larger version of the picture they currently have picked or a default picture (PicOne).  Here the user has the option to take a new picture and change the current Strings.  For the most part all of it works great.  My problem occurs when:</p>

<p>After the user picks a picture and backs out of the app.  The next time they open it, it will force close either when I go back to PickScreen or after I press done after taking a new picture and sometimes when I go to PicOne activity.  It does not do the same thing everytime, it just crashes at one of those points.</p>

<p>The other issue happens when I change the 3 String names.  After pressing save and going back to PickScreen, the app crashes when going back to PicOne or if I back out of the app crashes when going from MenuScreen to PickScreen.</p>

<p>I know this is a lot of code to look at, but I have spent a lot of time looking around and getting code from different places for this app and I am at a point that I cannot figure out.  I figure there are many people with more knowledge than me out there, so I am asking for your help.  I know that you cannot just ask a question without showing you have been doing any work, so here it is.</p>

<p>Why does may app work perfectly once and then crash in various spots the second time in?  By the way it does work fine after the force close, again only once.  And why does it force close when I change the Strings?  </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>one thing i considered using was a javascript code to pull feeds from other sites but there are no feeds available for gay specific, could i create one just by typing in pinknews.co.uk somehow and embed there news content on my site?</p>

<p>I have this dummy example where a class has a const number field, and ctor being marked constexpr should behave like a compile time constant. Which it does but some how fails with template function matching:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class ConstNum
{
public:
    constexpr ConstNum(int num) : _num(num)
    {
    }

    constexpr int number() const
    {

    }

private:
    const int _num;
};


template&lt;class T, size_t N&gt;
constexpr int num_elements(const T (&amp;arr) [N])
{
    return N;
}

int main()
{
    ConstNum c1(3);
    char arr[c1.number()];

    //  fails to compile here with error message:
    //  No matching function for call to num_elements
    //  
    std::cout &lt;&lt; num_elements(arr) &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am running on XCode, the error message gives details about this being
semantic issue: additional text being:</p>

<ol>
<li>Candidate template ignored: could not match 'const T[N]' against
'char [c1.number()]</li>
</ol>

<p>If I replace c1.number() by 3 this compiles fine.
Or If i remove the std::cout call entirely this compiles fine.</p>

<p>Any ideas what am I missing here.

<p>I have a file with <code>x</code> number of lines. I want to compare each line of that file with another line, and write that line to that file if they are different.</p>

<p>I looked for an answer but didn't find anything that I can use.  I tried something myself but it doesn't work.</p>

<p>My code:</p>

<pre><code>filename = ...
my_file = open(filename, 'r+')
for line in my_file:
    new_line = (""text"")
    print line
    print new_line
    if new_line == line:
        print('same')
    else:
        print('diffrent')
        my_file.write('%s' % (new_line))
</code></pre>

<p>I only want my application to write the line to the file if it doesn't already exist there.</p>

<pre><code>contents of filename
====================
text
text1
text2
</code></pre>

<p>In the case above where new line is ""text"", the application shouldn't do anything because that line already exist in the file. However, if the new line is ""text3"" then it should be written to the file as follows:</p>

What I want is a button, once clicked, flying randomly in either of the following ways:
1, it flies through five random position and flies back to original position. or
2, it flies randomly for 2 seconds, and then back to its original position.</p>

<p>Here is my code, but the stop control is still missing:</p>

<pre><code>   //if the button clicked
    [self animationLoop:@""Wrong!"" finished:1 context:nil];
    -(void)animationLoop:(NSString *)animationID finished:(int)finished context:(void *)context {

<p>I was wondering what is the best way to do incremental updates to the site? I mean I don't want to update the whole site, if I just changed one source file (html, php, images, etc) or made changes to the database. I understand, to be safe I'd have to update the database every time (export from local and import in remote), but I'm sure we can avoid unnecessary uploads of unchanged files.</p>

<p>I've seen <a href=""https://www.akeebabackup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.akeebabackup.com</a> and it doesn't offer what I need. One option is to use an ftp client (like Filezilla) which does folder synchronizations, but I'm not sure they work very well.</p>

We are using Devise to handle user authentication and RSpec for testing the application (Rails 4).</p>

<p>I have an <code>Admin</code> devise model which has access to some authenticated routes. Here's an excerpt from <code>routes.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>devise_for :admins

authenticate :admin do
  get 'admin', to: 'admin#index'
end
</code></pre>

<p>It (obviously) works flawlessly: if I visit <code>/admin</code>, I get redirected to <code>/admins/sign_in</code> and, once I sign in (or if I already am in session) I have direct access to <code>/admin</code>.</p>

<p>Now, as I understand, routes should be tested inside <code>spec/routes/&lt;controller_name&gt;_routes_spec.rb</code>. I like the idea of testing routes (and that the right controller handle each route with the right action etc.) on their own.</p>

<p>We're facing the issue of testing routes when the said routes are <code>authenticate</code>d. Including</p>

<pre><code>config.include Devise::TestHelpers[, type: :controller]
</code></pre>

<p>inside <code>spec/spec_helper.rb</code> still doesn't make the <code>sign_in</code> (or <code>sign_[out|up]</code>) methods available inside routes specs.</p>

<p>What are we supposed to do? How should we test authenticated routes?
It just feels wrong to me that non authenticated routes are tested as <code>spec/routes</code>, while authenticated routes should be tested inside integration tests, manually filling sign-in forms with Capybara-like stuff.</p>

If you think configure made a mistake, make sure you are using the latest

Include the log file ""config.log"" produced by configure as this will help
solving the problem.

<p>and from that i want an a fp-tree now by traversing this tree i want the maximal frequent itemsets as follows </p>

<p>The basic idea of  method is to dispose nodes in each “layer” from bottom to up. The concept of “layer” is different to the common concept of layer in a tree. Nodes in a “layer” mean the nodes correspond to the same item and be in a linked list from the “Head Table”. For nodes in a “layer” NBN method will be used to dispose the nodes from left to right along the linked list. To use NBN method, two extra fields will be added to each node in the ordered FP-Tree. The field tag of node N stores the information of whether N is maximal frequent itemset, and the field count’ stores the support count information in the nodes at left. </p>

<p>In Figure, the first node to be disposed is “juice: 2”. If the min_sup is equal to or less than 2 then “bread, milk, coffee, juice” is a maximal frequent itemset. Firstly output juice:2 and set the field tag of “coffee:3” as “false” (the field tag of each node is “true” initially ). Next check whether the right four itemsets juice:1 be the subset of juice:2. If the itemset one node “juice:1” corresponding to is the subset of juice:2 set the field tag of the node “false”. In the following process when the field tag of the disposed node is FALSE we can omit the node after the same tagging. If the min_sup is more than 2 then check whether the right four juice:1 is the subset of juice:2. If the itemset one node “juice:1” corresponding to is the subset of juice:2 then set the field count’ of the node with the sum of the former count’ and 2  After all the nodes “juice” disposed ,begin to dispose the node “coffee:3”.</p>

"18430915","1","18431329","","2013-08-25 16:02:36","","9","2398","<h2>Scenario</h2>

<p>I have a class call it <code>Model</code> that represents a complex, composite object of many other objects of varying types. You can think of it as a <code>Car</code> which has <code>Door[]</code>, <code>Tire[]</code>, <code>Engine</code>, <code>Driver</code> etc. And these objects in turn have sub objects such as <code>Engine</code> has <code>SparkPlug</code>, <code>Clutch</code>, <code>Generator</code> etc.</p>

<p>I have a <code>Metrics</code> class which calculates some more or less complex metrics about the <code>Model</code>, in essence it looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Metrics{
    private final Model model;

    public Metrics(Model aModel){model = aModel;}

    public double calculateSimpleMetric1(){...}
    public double calculateSimpleMetric2(){...}
    public double calculateSimpleMetricN(){...}

    public double calculateComplexMetric(){
        /* Function that uses calls to multiple calculateSimpleMetricX to 
           calculate a more complex metric. */
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have already written tests for the <code>calculateSimpleMetricX</code> functions and each of them require non-trivial, but manageable amounts (10-20 lines) of setup code to properly mock the related parts of the <code>Model</code>.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>Due to the unavoidable complexity of the <code>Model</code> class stubbing/mocking all the dependencies for <code>calculateComplexMetric()</code> would create a very large and difficult to maintain test (over 100 lines of setup code to test a reasonable representative scenario, and I need to test quite a few scenarios).</p>

<p>My thought is to create a partial mock of <code>Model</code> and stub the relevant <code>calculateSimpleMetricX()</code> functions to reduce the setup code to a manageable 10 or so lines of code. As these functions are already tested separately.</p>

<p>However, Mockito documentation states that <strong>partial mocks are a code smell</strong>.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p><em>Personally</em> I would cut the corner here and just partial mock the <code>Metrics</code> class. But I'm interested in knowing what is the ""purist"" way to structure this code and unit test?</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>I ended up doing splitting into smaller, more cohesive classes as suggested by the accepted answer and using dependency injection:</p>

<pre><code>public class AbstractMetric{
    abstract public double calculate();
}

public class ComplexMetric extends AbstractMetric{
    private final SimpleMetric1 sm1;
    private final SimpleMetric2 sm2;

    public ComplexMetric(SimpleMetric1 asm1, SimpleMetric2 asm2){
        sm1 = asm1;
        sm2 = asm2;
    }

    @Ovrerride
    public double calculate(){
        return functionof(sm1.calculate(), sm2.calculate());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is testable, and I can let each implementation of <code>AbstractMetric</code> implement caching if they need to to improve performance at a later stage. I find that adding the metrics to the constructor is acceptable comparing to passing them along to the calculate function in every call. Even this can be hidden with a factory method.</p>

<p>The dongle works alright in Angstrom but I am sufficiently neophyte as to not recognise if the support is there in Jelly bean. 
I begun testing with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>private BluetoothAdapter BA;
BA = BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter();
Intent turnOn = new Intent(BluetoothAdapter.ACTION_REQUEST_ENABLE);
startActivityForResult(turnOn, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>I get my BA, i get my turnOn intent but when I start the intent I get the allow permissions dialogs then the ""Turning Bluetooth on..."" modal indication which never clears.
The application threads are all running in the debugger but the UI looses focus and is unresponsive.</p>

<p>What can I do to debug the situation ?
How do I determine whether the dongle really is supported in this kernel or enable support if not ?
What provisions are in the Android UI for bluetooth connection/setup (I haven't seen any which may indicate a current lack of support)?</p>

<p>How can I debug the hung dialog ""Turning Bluetooth on..."" ?</p>

<p>Cheers much,

<p>read the datastream and echo what is received until the length of the file is outputed, and stop.</p>

<p>The problem is, as it could be expected, that before triggering the download, the whole file has to be echoed, causing time-outs PHP side, or just a really long loading page.
And then, when the file is echoed on the client side, the client has to download the file himself, which is not really optimised.</p>

    do { /* optionally multiple games */

When I resize the browser window, the elements or their containing div seem to change size, in which the divs begin to wrap in undesirable ways. When the page is 100% size, the divs align like this:<br /><br />
    |div| |div| |div| |div| |div| |div|<br />
    |div| |div| |div| |div| |div| |div|
<br /><br />When I shrink the window, the divs align like this:<br /><br />
    |div| |div| |div| |div| |div|<br />
    |div| |div| |div| |div| |div|<br />
    |div| |div|
<br /><br />So, I am trying to make the divs stay in the first position when the window is resized. Upon Googling this, I have found solutions like using <strong>CSS</strong> to set the containing div with a fixed width, and using the attribute <code>white-space: nowrap</code>... these do not work for my page however, and it seems that Ajax is the reason. In my <strong>PHP</strong> file for the Ajax, I have created each div to have a link and a table inside like so:<br /><br /></p>

<pre><code>    $str = ""&lt;div class = 'productdiv'&gt;
                &lt;a class='product' id='$id' title = '$name'&gt;
                    &lt;table id = 'product-table' onmouseover = 'darkenProduct(this);' onmouseout = 'lightenProduct(this);'&gt;
                        &lt;tr&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;$name&lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;/tr&gt;
                        &lt;tr&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src = '$img' /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;/tr&gt;
                        &lt;tr&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;$price&lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;/tr&gt;
                    &lt;/table&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;"";&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the relevant CSS for each Ajax element, and the containing div ""products"":<br /><br /></p>

<pre><code>#products
{
    width: 900px;

    margin-left: 2%;
}
/*product table (ID SOURCE FROM PHP -- for each individual product) */
#product-table
{
    float: left;

    width: 138px;
    height: 142px;

    color: #333;
    text-decoration: none;

    border: 1px solid black;
    background-color: #eee;

    /* for rounded borders */
        -moz-border-radius: 25px; /* for firefox */
        border-radius: 25px;
}
#product-table a:link, a:visited
{           
    display: -moz-box; /* for firefox */
    display: block; 

    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
#product-table img
{
    width: 138px;
    height: 142px;
    border: 1px solid black;
}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The containing div ""products"" is nested inside a larger div for the center column. Here is the CSS for that:<br /><br /></p>

<pre><code>/* center column */
#center
{
    /* for stretching the center column beyond the window height */
        min-height: 100%;

    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;

    text-align: center;
}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"3578680","1","","","2010-08-26 19:19:17","","0","1014","<p>Caveat:  I have looked for the answer to my question and several come close, but I'm still missing something.  Here is the scenario:</p>

<p>I want a way to create <code>UITableViewCell</code>s that contain <code>UISwitch</code>es dynamically at run time, based on the data in a table (which I can do).  The problem becomes connecting the switches such that I can get their value when that view is changed (navigated away, closed, etc).  I have tried to use the events <code>UIControlEventValueChanged</code> to be notified, but have failed to specify it correctly, because it dumps when that switch is tapped.  Also, there doesn't seem to be any way to uniquely identify the switch so that if all the events are handled by a single routine (ideal), I can't tell them apart.</p>

<p>So...</p>

<p>If I have a UITableView:</p>

<pre><code>@interface RootViewController : UITableViewController 
{
    UISwitch * autoLockSwitch;
}

@property (nonatomic, retain) UISwitch * autoLockSwitch;
-(void) switchFlipState: (id) sender;
@end
</code></pre>

<p>// the .m file:</p>

<pre><code>@implementation RootViewController
// ...


- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath 
{
    static NSString * CellIdentifier = @""Cell"";
    int row          = 0;
    NSString * label = nil;
    TableCellDef_t  * cell_def = nil;

    row = indexPath.row;
    cell_def = &amp;mainMenuTableCellsDef[ row ];

    UITableViewCell * cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
    if (cell == nil) 
    {
        cell = [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier] autorelease];
    }
    label = (NSString *) mainMenuTableCellsDef[indexPath.row].text;
    [cell.textLabel setText:(NSString *) mainMenuItemStrings[ indexPath.row ]];
    if (cell_def-&gt;isSpecial)  // call special func/method to add switch et al to cell.
    {
        (*cell_def-&gt;isSpecial)(cell );  // add switch, button, etc.
    }
    else
    {
        [cell setAccessoryType:UITableViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator];
    }
}


and this is the 'special' function:

-(void) autoLockSpecialItem :(UITableViewCell *) cell
{
    autoLockSwitch = [[[UISwitch alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero] autorelease];
    [autoLockSwitch addTarget:self action:@selector(switchFlipState:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged ];
    [cell addSubview:autoLockSwitch];
    cell.accessoryView = autoLockSwitch;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and finally:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) switchFlipState: (id) sender
{
    NSLog(@""FLIPPED"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>==============================================================</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why would it crash (bad selector) when the switch was tapped?  I believe that my code follows all the example code that I have seen, but obviously something is wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>I cannot put a instance method into a table as a function pointer; and it doesn't seem to like a class method either.  If I make it a 'C/C++' function, how do I get access to the class/instance member variables?  That is, if I want to put a call to <code>autoLockSpecialItem</code> into a static table (or reasonable facsimile) such that I can get <code>autoLockSwitch</code> member variable?  If I make it a class method and the <code>autoLockSwitch</code> var a static, will that be valid?</p></li>
<li><p>More simply:  how do I connect the <code>UIControlEventValueChanged</code> to my view (I have tried and failed) and can I differentiate at runtime within the event handler which switch has changed?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a better way?  I cannot believe that I am the first person to have to solve this type of problem.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The problem is :
When I want to return to my application (by unlocking the screen), sometimes my application goes blank. No elements are shown. There is no such messages saying ""process bla bla bla has stopped unexpectedly"". It's just blank.</p>

<p>I just want the process to run even when the screen is locked (no prevention of locking the screen just like this --> <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10446299/prevent-screen-lock-on-dimming-standby-while-using-android-app"">Prevent screen lock on dimming/standby while using android app?</a>).</p>

It turns out that creating a single hover event over a set of things requires tricky work-arounds, since Raphael will detect a mouse in/out when you change between items within the set. (The original question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14224071/hovering-over-a-set-of-elements-in-raphaeljs/"">Hovering over a set of elements in Raphaeljs</a> )</p>

<p>The accepted answer in the aforementioned question uses the <code>isPointInside</code> function to decide whether a mouse in/out is actually moving in/out of the entire set. It works great with their demo: (blue circle is with their fix, red without)</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/amustill/Bh276/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/amustill/Bh276/1</a></p>

<p>However, the red square that appears in this example represents my image, and if you move your mouse quickly between the red square and outside the blue square, the hover out event is never caught. Additionally, mousing over the border of the red square often causes glitching.</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/wTUex/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/wTUex/</a></p>

<p>Why does isPointInside seem to be returning incorrectly? Is there a more accurate function for this I can use?</p>

<p>It works perfectly. Load the html file, changes the font color, italic and size, but it does not seem to want to change the font itself to Arial.</p>

<p>The imported HTML looks like this:

<p>The imported html is generated by software and it can not be edited in the program itself therefore I am trying to load it and change its formatting.</p>

<p>The script below worked perfectly. Unfortunatly the imported html uses spaces to aligh text. Obviously this can not be changed. The working script messes the spacing if you change the font from courier to anything else as can be seen on the images. Is it posible to fix this?</p>

<pre><code>function applyPreFont(){
var oldHtml = $('#result pre').html();
$('#result pre').html('&lt;div class=""pre-div""&gt;' + oldHtml + '&lt;/div&gt;');
}

function LoadExternalContent(pagename){

<p>""[Microsoft][SQL Server native Client 10.0]Connection is bust with results for another command""</p>

<p>The error was occurring on a subsequent cursor that is executed on each iteration of the fetch.</p>

<p>I was able to resolve the error by replacing the CTE with a derived table.</p>

<p>I need to know why the derived table works fine, while the CTE fails, and if I did something wrong in the CTE example.</p>

<p>The original query was relatively complex, involving multiple joins, but basically amounts to the following:</p>

<pre><code>WITH cteResults AS (
    SELECT Account.Id AS AccountId
    FROM Accounts AS Account
    WHERE Account.Number = '12345'
    UNION
    SELECT SubAccount.Id
    FROM SubAccounts AS SubAccount
    WHERE SubAccount.Number = '12345')

SELECT
    Invoice.Value AS InvoiceValue,
    CASE
        WHEN Representative.Sequence IS NOT NULL THEN THEN Representative.Name
        ELSE Account.OwnerName
    END AS InvoiceName
FROM cteResults
INNER JOIN Invoices AS Invoice ON
    Invoice.AccountId = cteResults.AccountId
LEFT OUTER JOIN Accounts AS Account ON
    Account.Id = Invoice.AccountId
LEFT OUTER JOIN AccountRepresentatives AS Representative ON
    Representative.Id = Invoices.AccountRepresentativeId
</code></pre>

<p>The code in question would loop through a cursor using the above statement, and for each iteration of FETCH, it would execute a second cursor:</p>

<pre><code>FOREACH InvoicesCursor INTO InvoiceResults.*
    OPEN FormattingRulesCursor
    FETCH FormattingRulesCursor into FormattingRules.*
    // Error appears here
    CLOSE FormattingRulesCursor
END FOREACH
</code></pre>

<p>Any cursor that is opened from the application during the FOREACH statement fails with the error I mentioned above.</p>

<p>However, if I drop the CTE and use a derived table, I do not receive the error and everything works appropriately.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    Invoice.Value AS InvoiceValue,
    CASE
        WHEN Representative.Sequence IS NOT NULL THEN THEN Representative.Name
        ELSE Account.OwnerName

FROM (SELECT Account.Id AS AccountId

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I want to iterate firstly over all div child of segmenter with id ""variable"", then iterate over all input with id ""category"" of each child ""variable"".</p>

<p>Using Chrome Dev tools:</p>

<p>With:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#segmenter &gt; #variable"")
</code></pre>

<p>I get every div variable: <code>[&lt;div id=​""variable"" name=​""Zona""&gt;​…​&lt;/div&gt;​, &lt;div id=​""variable"" name=​""Tipo de Restaurante""&gt;​…​&lt;/div&gt;​]</code></p>

<p>Now from here everything that I tried don't work, for example:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#segmenter &gt; #variable"").find(""#category"");
</code></pre>

<p>I only get 4 input ""category"": <code>[&lt;input id=​""category"" type=​""checkbox"" value=​""Centro""&gt;​, &lt;input id=​""category"" type=​""checkbox"" value=​""Freestander""&gt;​, &lt;input id=​""category"" type=​""checkbox"" value=​""Instore""&gt;​, &lt;input id=​""category"" type=​""checkbox"" value=​""Mall""&gt;​]</code></p>

<p>I don't know why, what I need is iterate something like:</p>

<pre><code>var oVariables = $(""#segmenter &gt; #variable"");
$.each(oVariables, function(){
    var oCategory = $(this).find(""#category"").text();//in the first call for div-name=""zone"", only have the first input-value""center""
    //Iterate Again
        //get checked values, etc
});
</code></pre>

<p>Many Thanks.</p>

Since these values will not change during execution, I think GCC should be able to handle this.</p>

<p>Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

struct name_data {
    char *name;
    char *data;
} name_bins [] = {
    { ""John"", ""\xAA\xAA\x00\xAA"" },
    { ""Mark"", ""\xFF\x0A\x00\x33\x01\x01\x03\x04\x04\x05"" },
};

char bin_test[] = ""\xFF\x0A\x00\x33\x01\x01\x03\x04\x04\x05"";

int main () {
    printf(""sizeof(bin_test) = %lu\n"", sizeof(bin_test));
    printf(""sizeof(name_bins[1].data) = %lu\n"", sizeof(name_bins[1].data));
    exit(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output of this code is:</p>

<pre><code>sizeof(bin_test) = 11
sizeof(name_bins[1].data) = 8
</code></pre>

<p>However, <code>bin_test</code> is equivalent to <code>name_bins[1].data</code> in content &mdash; although the type definition is different &mdash; <code>bin_test</code> is a <code>char[]</code> and <code>names_bins[1].data</code> is a <code>char*</code>.</p>

<p>Is there a way to define the <code>name_bins</code> array with <code>char[]</code>s instead?
Is there a way to force GCC to recognize this values as static constants and return the real content size with <code>sizeof()</code> &mdash; which it already calculates at compile time?</p>

There is one limitation here: It needs to work with fairly any smartphone and computer (so no flash here. Such a pity). The good part is that   it can be entirely done on the server, without showing the resulting picture to the user (so it can be processed by external applications and it doesn't need to be ""that fast"").</p>

The first question is about the link of armadillo and c++. I installed armadillo by following the instructions in the package and the location is <code>/usr/include/</code>, I could successfully run the code:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include ""/usr/include/armadillo""

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    arma::mat a = arma::randu&lt;arma::mat&gt;(3, 3);
    cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; endl;    
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>but if I want to define a function, for example, the inverse of the matrix (there is a function I can call from the library but I just want to do a test). </p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include ""/usr/include/armadillo""

using namespace std;

arma::mat Inverse( arma::mat A){
    return arma::inv(A);
}

int main()
{
    arma::mat a = arma::randu&lt;arma::mat&gt;(3, 3);
    arma::mat inv_a = Inverse(a);
    cout &lt;&lt; inv_a &lt;&lt; endl;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I checked by google and have tried some advices, like:<a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/369946/"" rel=""nofollow"">"" In miscellaneous MAC OS X linkers, I had to put ""-01 -larmadillo"" AND I had to deactivate the shared library settings!""</a>, to be honest, I can not find the <code>miscellaneous</code> option and <code>deactivate the shared library settings</code> as i am not familiar with Xcode. Then I followed <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21222662/importing-armadillo-c-library-into-xcode"">install MacPorts</a> and the library is installed to the folder <code>/usr/local/include/</code>, and I tried again, the first program is alright but the second program still has three errors, could anyone help me with this?</p>

<p>The second question would be the use of lapack when I am using armadillo in the same program, as I know armadillo is based on lapack, then if I declared the library <code>armadillo</code>, do I need to declare <code>lapacke.h</code>. Why do I ask this questions is that when I declared <code>RcppArmadillo</code> and <code>lapacke.h</code>, an error exists:</p>

<p>I got the same error when I tried to do this in <code>cmd</code>.

<p>I'm building an app where a webpage opens, loading JSON of a large data tree structure.  TreeModel.js parses this great and all is well.</p>

<p>As time continues, the browser receives updates in the form of smaller data trees.  I'm trying to wrap my head around combining the <code>additionalData</code> to the <code>masterTree</code>.  I can't think of a way to simultaneously walk both and do a node-by-node comparison.  If I could, it would be easy to aggregate <code>node.model.x</code> properties and add children if they don't exist.</p>

<p>In the code below, I walk through the additional data - but I don't know how to efficiently combine new nodes to the <code>masterTree</code>.  Can someone help my methodology with psuedo-code or point me in the right direction?  What's the best way to continually update my <code>masterTree</code>? </p>

<p>Many thanks.</p>

<pre><code>var tree = new TreeModel();
var masterTree = tree.parse(data1);

var additionalData = tree.parse(data2);
additionalData.walk(function (node) {

    // compare additionalData to the masterTree
    if (node.model.id == masterTree.model.id) {
        console.debug('match, combine the attributes')
    } else {
        // add the additional node to the materTree

<p>The editor, naturally, has controls and an editable area.  Each has their own DIV.  I want the controls to take up as much space as they need to, and the editable area to fill the rest of the space.</p>

<p>If I use tables, this is extremely easy to achieve.  I just turn off borders and padding and margins, and throw each DIV into a cell in its own row, and maybe fiddle with max-height on the controls DIV.  This is what it looks like:</p>

<p><img src=""http://img407.imageshack.us/img407/8435/table1.png"" alt=""Base table"" /></p>

<p><img src=""http://img264.imageshack.us/img264/6438/table2p.png"" alt=""Same table with window resized another way"" /></p>

<p>Notice the editable section taking up as much space as possible without causing scrollbars to appear.</p>

<p>I've monkeyed with various CSS examples and nothing seems to work without having some JavaScript run on resize to make the editable DIV be the height of the parent minus the height of the controls.</p>

<p>Of course, I can make the parent DIV have display:table and the child DIVs wrapped in display:table-row DIVs and themselves have display:table-cell, but...well...in that case it's exactly the same as using TABLE, TR, and TD, but ten times more ugly for the sake of CSS purity.  (Why bother?)</p>

<p>So, without directly using display:table &amp; friends, nor TABLE/TR/TD, nor JavaScript, is there a pure CSS way of doing this?  In other words, is there a pure CSS way of saying, DIV1, take up as little vertical space as possible, and DIV2, take up the remaining vertical space within the parent element?</p>

<p>If there isn't, I'm quite ready to stop subscribing to the ""pure CSS"" mentality.  It's caused me enough grief with very little developer or end-user benefit.</p>

<p>The menu uses the latest version of jQuery (v1.10.2) and uses slide and animate only to open and close the different parts of the menu. I have tried googling various combinations of slow jQuery, slow loading menus and slow animations for IE8 and jQuery that I can, and I cannot even find anything remotely like the issue I'm having.</p>

<p>You can see the problem by going to my <a href=""http://mercury.demomycms.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">website here</a>. Visit it with IE8 and you will notice the really slow speeds when you click on Test Category 1 or 2. </p>

<p>Has anyone come across this kind of issue before? Does anyone know what causes it and the solution to get it working fine?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I have noticed that it's not just affecting the menu, but also the carousel. If you look at the animations they are not sliding either, however in IE9 + they do slide. I'm not sure if the two are linked but it seems odd that it's both jQuery effects that are being affected.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p>After some more testing I have noticed that if the bottom of the menu falls over the Tabs below the carousel then the bit over the tabs shows straight away, if you however over the tabs. Same happens when you close the menu. Hover over the tabs and the bit of the menu drawn there goes away.</p>

<p>I then watched and noticed that the menu shows and disappears when the carousel changes. It does seem to be a redraw issue, however the code I've been trying to make it paint upon completion doesn't seem to be working. This is the code I got from another <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1397478/forcing-a-dom-refresh-in-internet-explorer-after-javascript-dom-manipulation#answer-4271996"">answer here</a> (slightly modified to work with jQuery elements thanks to an answer below).</p>

<pre><code>function FlushThis(id){
   var msie = 'Microsoft Internet Explorer';
   var tmp = 0;
   //var elementOnShow = document.getElementById(id);
   var elementOnShow = $(id);
   if(navigator.appName == msie) {
      tmp = elementOnShow.parentNode.offsetTop  +  'px';
   } else {
      tmp = elementOnShow.offsetTop;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think it might be a case of either finding the correct function to redraw, or running that function on the correct element. I currently run that on the clicked element, which may not be the correct one. I have tried running that function on various elements, including the main UL, the element clicked, the element, opened and the element opened's parent. No luck with any of them.</p>

<p><strong>JSFiddle:</strong> As requested <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/styphon/fjnXE/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">here is a JSFiddle</a> of the issue, however for me that won't even work in IE10. It works in Chrome fine.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong></p>

<p>I have stripped away everything except the bare essentials and put it in a test file. You can <a href=""http://mercury.demomycms.co.uk/test.html"" rel=""nofollow"">veiw it on my website here</a>. I am getting no errors in IE console, nor in any other console. It is still giving the same issue, where the menu isn't drawn. However because there is no carousel behind it to force the redraw it never shows on this test site.</p>

<p>All the redraw scripts I've tried so far have failed. How can I get this working?</p>

But I'm a bit confused when it comes to the usage of the class ""Stage"", when creating several stages.
Is the best solution just to create classes for every level that all extend Stage or is there no need for that, and the best solution is to have classes for each level and have a Stage-object in there?

<p>And this is the PHP that runs the form</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
if(!isset($_POST['submit']))
{
    //This page should not be accessed directly. Need to submit the form.
    echo ""error; you need to submit the form!"";
}
$name = $_POST['name'];
$lastname = $_POST['lastname'];
$company = $_POST['company'];
$visitor_email = $_POST['email'];
$message = $_POST['message'];
$email_from = $visitor_email;//&lt;== update the email address
$email_subject = ""New Form submission"";
$email_body = ""You have received a new message from the user $name, $lastname.\n"".
    ""Here is the message:\n $message"".

$to = ""email@gmail.com"";
$headers = ""From: $email_from \r\n"";
$headers .= ""Reply-To: $visitor_email \r\n"";
//Send the email!
mail($to,$email_subject,$email_body,$headers);
echo ""Mail Sent. Thank you "" . $name . "", we will contact you shortly."";
alert(""yo"");
//done. redirect to thank-you page.
header('Location: index.html');
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I added alert and echo for submit button, but none of them appears so looks like PHP is not even running.
It would be great if someone could guide me trough this problem or point out what am I doing wrong.</p>

However, I am at the moment only trying to get the to phone receive a sms, check if it is containing the string, get the location, and then toast the location on the phone. My problem is, as I am very very new to android programming/Java (Only 15) I'm having trouble with passing my location from my MainActivity to my Broadcast Receiver. I am getting a Null Pointer exception - this is when my application manages to get the gps location. Also a point to note out, I am using 'Cerberus Anti-theft', as my main anti-theft, could this cause any errors?</p>

<p>This is my MainActivity - where my LocationListener is, as you can see, I have commented out the Toast.makeText() on the onLocationChanged, if I un-comment it, I do get the correct co-ordinates. Meaning it must be something to do with my intent stuff - which to me <strong>looks</strong> perfectly fine.</p>

<p>This is my SmsReceiver class, this is where the sms is retrieved to check for the containing string. I have tried everything that I have seen on this sort of thing (My history is full of this stuff), but what ever I did, the latitude and longitude still return 300 - the default value which I set. I am sure it is something to do with my intent setup and receiving the intent, just don't know what it is what is wrong. So, please read through and give me feedback on anything you find wrong with it.</p>

For those with an internet connection I am simply using an SMTP server and sending an email.  This is working fine.  </p>

<p>For those without an internet connection I want to have a simple local password reset. I was attempting to do this local password reset by creating a form very similar to that of the built-in password recovery class. I first ask for the user's username, and they are then prompted to answer their security question.  After answering the question I was going to redirect the user to the change password page.  My problem is that I was hoping to use the built-in asp.NET user security question, but I can't seem to find a way to access the answer to the question.  Furthermore if someone can help access the question's answer, I was wondering if there was an authentication for this, or if I should do a simple string comparison between the answer typed in and the answer stored to the user.</p>

<p>my table already has an css design where </p>

<pre><code>td
{
 background: #EDEDED;

<p>I have ended up with a list for a heap that contains <code>tuples (Metric, Key)</code>.</p>

<p>But to get the right element via key I had to create a separate map and maintain it's validity  for each change in the heap.</p>

<p>So in the end instead of having functions with two parameters like <code>heapup(heap, i)</code>, I had to pass map to all the functions - <code>heapup(heap, i, map)</code>. </p>

<p>I am wondering if there is a simpler way to do this through procedures, lists and dictionaries. Or Heap object will be required to hide the Map inside?</p>

<pre><code> def heapup(L, i, map):

    if i == 0: return i # we reached the top!
    if i &gt;= len(L): return i
    if L[parent(i)] &gt; L[i]:
       # print ""going up""
        (L[i], L[parent(i)]) = (L[parent(i)], L[i])
        map[L[i][1]] = i
        map[L[parent(i)][1]] = parent(i)
        return up_heapify(L, parent(i), map)
    else:
     #   print ""going down""
        if leaf(L,i): return i
        if one_child(L,i): return i # we could only come this way
        if L[i] &gt; L[left(i)]: # compare with left child
            (L[i], L[left(i)]) = (L[left(i)], L[i])
            map[L[i][1]] = i
            map[L[left(i)][1]] = left(i)
            return left(i)
        if L[i] &gt; L[right(i)]: # compare with right child
            (L[i], L[right(i)]) = (L[right(i)], L[i])
            map[L[i][1]] = i
            map[L[right(i)][1]] = right(i)
            return right(i)
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to get rid of map in that function but still be able to get items values from heap by their key which I now can do like this:</p>

<pre><code>item = heap[map[key]]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

<p>if  </p>

<pre><code>L = [(3,'A'), (5, 'D'), (4, 'G') ...]

<p>then</p>

<pre><code>map = {'A':0, 'D':1, 'G': 2, ...}

<p>so I can get a value of an element like this: </p>

<pre><code>L[map['G']]

My process consists of two projects (so two EXE files) - an ""interface"" and a ""launch stub"" - and here's the process:</p>

<ol>
<li>User has a shortcut that launches ""Interface.exe notepad.exe""</li>
<li>Interface.exe has a form that asks for the credentials they'd like to use</li>
<li>Interace.exe uses ProcessStartInfo to create an instance of LaunchStub.exe (LS) as the new user</li>
<li>LS uses ProcessStartInfo (with ShellExecute set to true) to launch the requested file, and since it's already running as the requested user, so is the new process.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reason I have a two-step process is that I want users to be able to right-click on any file the OS has a default action for (.EXE, .SQL, .MSC, etc) and launch it, and ProcessStartInfo only supports that with ""UseShellExecute"" enabled, but that switch prevents me from using new credentials, so I can only do one at a time.</p>

<p>This causes a few problems - first, the user has to already exist on the computer, meaning they have to have logged in locally before. If there's no local profile for that user, the requested app will sometimes launch, but I get registry and profile exceptions because the application expects things to exist that don't yet (like an HKCU hive in the registry, which the user doesn't have because they've never logged in).</p>

<p>I know I should be able to just ""Elevate"" the rights of my application to the user they're requesting, launch my new process, and then undo the elevation, but I'm unable to find a good code sample for that, and I'm not sure that it would allow running as a completely different user. Does this all make sense? I just can't help feel like there's a better way to do this.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I just tried <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/ralfw/archive/2003/11/24/39479.aspx"">some Impersonation code</a> I found online, but to no avail. When used in conjunction with ProcessStartInfo, it still seems to launch processes using my current login, not the one I've provided, even though I've activated impersonation using the provided credentials.</p>

I used Bind on my Debian server to set it all up, and went to change the Nameservers records to my new hosting. I did a typo and saved it. I thought it will take few seconds to bounce back with the error. As the domain's status was ""Pending Update"" I waited for 30 minutes and then called Godaddy's customer support. They told me that it should finish the process within 45 minutes max. After 3 hours I called again and been told it will take 4-8 hours. Now I just called again (10 hours later) and been told it will take 5-10 days. (as a side note, their reps do not have any knowledge of this process and each time they been telling me that it is stuck at different ""stages"" of this change process.) </p>

<p>From reading their <a href=""https://support.godaddy.com/help/article/680/managing-dns-for-your-domain-names"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> I was under the impression the change should be really fast, but for the various networks to catch up with the change can take up to 48 hours. </p>

<p>The domain name is a *.RU, and I have been told by GoDaddy's reps that they submitted a request of NS change to the ""registry"" and that can take that long as they need to verify the NS (NS is buggy and will not ping out anything...) </p>

<p>So, the questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does anyone know the step-by-step behind the scenes processes that happen as you submit an NS change with GoDaddy?</li>
<li>Does anyone know for a fact that *.RU domains can take up to 5-10 days to reply back to GoDaddy with anything? Does GoDaddy even contact anyone in the *.RU field?</li>
<li>Has anyone had prior similar experience with GoDaddy and was able to expedite it somehow?</li>

<p>I've got everything stored in a single collection, and I'd like to keep it that way if possible. So the collection is setup like this:</p>

<pre><code>[
    {
        title: 'A random title',
        date_created: '01/01/2001',
        comments:
            [
                {'message': 'Lorem ipsum', date_created: '01/01/2001'},
                [...]
            ]
    },
    [...]
]
</code></pre>

<p>So what I'd like to do is have the newsfeed non-reactive, so that when a new news item is inserted or updated, the template holding the list of news won't get re-rendered. But if a comment is added, deleted, or someone likes the news feed, I'd want that to get updated right away in the template.</p>

<p>I've been trying to figure out how to use <code>{{#isolate}}</code> and <code>{{#constant}}</code> but to no prevail.</p>

<p><strong>Here's my client side JS:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Template.group_feed.feed_data = function() {
    var feed = Newsfeed.find({}, {
        sort: {updated_time: -1},
        limit: 10,
        reactive: false
    }).fetch();

    return feed;
};
</code></pre>

<p><em>I set <code>reactive: false</code> so that it doesn't update the template, but that makes it static also when comments or likes are updated. So I'm guessing there's a better way to do this then to make the whole collection non-reactive.</em></p>

<p><strong>Here's my template code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;template name=""group_feed""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""feed-wrapper""&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            {{#each feed_data}}
                {{&gt; group_feed_item}}
            {{/each}}
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;template name=""group_feed_item""&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;div class=""comments""&gt;
            {{#each comments}}
                &lt;p&gt;{{message}}&lt;/p&gt;
            {{/each}}
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

<p>What I'm doing in my app is displaying a list of coin types and face values available in my database for a country, so coins from the UK might have a face value of ""1 farthing"" or ""6 pence"".  The <code>face_value</code> is the 6, the <code>currency_type</code> is the ""pence"", stored in a related table.</p>

<p>I have the following code in my view that gets me 90% of the way there:</p>

<pre><code>def coins_by_country(request, country_name):
    country = Country.objects.get(name=country_name)
    coin_values = Collectible.objects.filter(country=country.id, type=1).extra(select={'count': 'count(1)'},
                               order_by=['-count']).values('count', 'face_value', 'currency_type')
    coin_values.query.group_by = ['currency_type_id', 'face_value']
    return render_to_response('icollectit/coins_by_country.html', {'coin_values': coin_values, 'country': country } )
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>currency_type_id</code> comes across as the number stored in the foreign key field (i.e. 4).  What I want to do is retrieve the actual object that it references as part of the query (the Currency model, so I can get the Currency.name field in my template).</p>

<p>What's the best way to do that?</p>

I want to factor this out into its own function that takes the path to a file and gives you the matching lines, but I cannot figure out how to correctly factor this out.</p>

<p>Here's what I think is close, but I get a compiler error:</p>

        .filter(|&amp;x| pattern.is_match(x)).collect();
    return m_lines;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the compiler error:</p>

<p>If I use <code>String</code> instead of <code>&amp;str</code> I instead get this error:</p>

<pre><code>src/main.rs:108:30: 108:36 error: `buffer` does not live long enough

<p>Which kind of makes sense.  I guess the lines stay inside the <code>buffer</code> which goes out of scope at the end of the function, so collecting a vector of references to strings doesn't really help us.</p>

<p>How do I return a collection of lines?</p>

Recently, we switched this to using an identity property.  The problem is that in order to upgrade a client to the latest version of the software, we have to change about 150 tables to identity.  To do this manually, you can right click on a table, choose design, change (Is Identity) to ""Yes"" and then save the table.  From what I understand, in the background, SQL Server exports this to a temporary table, drops the table and then copies everything back into the new table.  Clients may have their own unique indexes and possibly other things specific to the client, so making a generic script isn't really an option.</p>

<p>It would be really awesome if there was a stored procedure for scripting this task rather than doing it in the GUI (which takes FOREVER).  We made a macro that can go through and do this, but even then, it takes a long time to run and is error prone.  Something like: exec sp_change_to_identity 'table_name', 'column name'</p>

<p>Does something like this exist?  If not, how would you handle this situation?</p>

At first I tried to actually run this in a Windows service, but couldn't get it work - getting null reference errors coming from _push.QueueNotification() call.  Then I did exactly what the documented sample code did and it worked: </p>

<pre><code>    PushService _push = new PushService();

<p><strong>Issue #1</strong>: 
This works perfectly and I see the notification pop up on the iPhone.  However, since it's called a Push Service, I assumed it would behave like a service - meaning, I instantiate it and call _push.StartApplePushService() within a Windows service perhaps.  And I thought to actually queue up my notifications, I could do this on the front-end (admin app, let's say): </p>

<pre><code>        PushService push = new PushService();

        AppleNotification notification = NotificationFactory.Apple()
                                                            .ForDeviceToken(deviceToken)
                                                            .WithAlert(message)
                                                            .WithSound(""default"")
                                                            .WithBadge(badge);
        push.QueueNotification(notification);
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously (and like I already said), it didn't work - the last line kept throwing a null reference exception. </p>

<p>I'm having trouble finding any other kind of documentation that would show how to set this up in a service/client manner (and not just call everything at once).  Is it possible or am I missing the point of how PushSharp should be utilized?</p>

<p><strong>Issue #2</strong>:
Also, I can't seem to find a way to target many device tokens at once, without looping through them and queuing up notifications one at a time.  Is that the only way or am I missing something here as well? </p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I am running into an issue with Selenium where it can not see a button that I am trying to click. 
Here is what the element looks like: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;a data-ember-action=""792"" href=""#""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<p></p>

<pre><code>&lt;svg xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" style=""margin-top:8px; margin-left:16px;"" width=""16"" height=""16""&gt;

&lt;/svg&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>I have tried the following in order to find the element: </p>

<pre><code>wd.find_element_by_xpath(""//image[contains(@src,'/assets/images/edit.f65eeadf.svg')]/parent::a"").click()
</code></pre>

<p>and: </p>

<pre><code>edit_icon_button = wd.find_element_by_partial_link_text(""f65eeadf.svg"")
edit_icon_button.click()
</code></pre>

<p>and: </p>

<pre><code>edit_product_icon = wd.find_element_by_css_selector(""img[alt='Edit product'][src*='/assets/images/edit.f65eeadf.svg'"")
edit_product_icon.click()
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing I have tried seems to work. </p>

<p>Does anyone have suggestions on how to find this element on the page? </p>

<p><code>clang</code> now (>3.3) supports unicode characters in <em>variable names</em> <a href=""http://llvm.org/releases/3.3/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html#major-new-features"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llvm.org/releases/3.3/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html#major-new-features</a>.</p>

    double ∞ = 99999.; // infinity, error
}

<p>giving:</p>

<pre><code>error: non-ASCII characters are not allowed outside of literals and identifiers
        double ∞ = 99999.;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>What is the fundamental difference between <code>α</code> (alpha) and <code>∞</code> (infinty) for <code>clang</code>?</strong> That the former is unicode and the latter is not unicode but at the same time is not ASCII?</p>

<p><strong>Is there a workaround or an option to allow this set of characters in <code>clang</code> (or BTW in <code>gcc</code>)?</strong> </p>

<p><em>Notes: 1) <code>∞</code> is just an example, there are a lot of characters that are potentially useful but also forbidden, like <code>∫</code> or <code>∂</code>. 2) I am not asking if it is good idea, please take it as a technical question. 3) I am interested in C++ compiler of <code>clang 3.4</code> in Linux (<code>gcc 4.8.3</code> doesn't support this). I am saving the source files with <code>gedit</code> using <code>UTF-8</code> encoding and <code>Unix/Linux</code> line ending. 4) adding other normal first characters doesn't help: <code>_∞</code></em></p>

  <p>The answers point to a definite NO. Some ranges are indeed not
  allowed nor will they be soon. To move one step further to total
  craziness, the best alternative I found was to use 
  characters that effectively look the same. (Now, <em>this</em> I might admit is not a good idea.) Those alternatives can be found here
  <a href=""http://shapecatcher.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shapecatcher.com/</a>. The result (sorry if it hurts your eyes):</p>

  double ꝏ = 99999.; // letter oo
  double Ꝏ = 99999.; // letter OO
//    double ⧜ = 99999.; // incomplete infinity still error

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Problem has been further diagnosed. Any list/anchor that was generated by an ng controller, is not responding to hash changes outside the scope, while the static links are. from the plunkr link, ""foo"" and ""bar"" clicks trigger the controller but ""abc"" and ""def"" are not. please review. Question is how to make ""abc"" and ""def"" (dynamic links) respond to changes as well. </p>

</code></pre>

<p>obviously there should only be one of each number as each member can only join each group once.</p>

<p>i have never really used foreach loops before no am not 100% sure on their working, i have done a bit of research on the syntax but cant work out where i am going wrong. i can only assume i am calling something twice but not sure where.</p>

<p>if anyone knows of a better method to achieve what i need other than a foreach loop i am all ears</p>

<p>thanks</p>

In my Board class which constructs the countries, continents, and their adjacencies, I am reading in three different text files. When I construct a new continent, its' constructor expects the following
(String name, int bonusArmies , ArrayList memberCountries).
Now, I am using a Scanner to read from a text file that is organized as so,
The name, bonus army that it has, and the rest on each line is its member countries.</p>

<p>North America,5,Alaska,Alberta,Central America,Eastern United States,Greenland,Northwest Territory,Ontario,Quebec,Western United States
South America,2,Argentina,Brazil,Venezuela
Europe,5,Great Britain,Iceland,Northern Europe,Scandinavia,Southern Europe,Ukraine,Western Europe
Africa,3,Congo,East Africa,Egypt,Madagascar,North Africa,South Africa
Asia,7,Afghanistan,China,India,Irkutsk,Japan,Kamchatka,Middle East,Mongolia,Siam,Siberia,Ural,Yakutsk
Australia,2,Eastern Australia,Indonesia,LotR,New Guinea,Western Australia</p>

<p>I know I need to set a delimiter for Scanner which I have tried multiple approaches but, to no avail.Here is an example of what I tried for creating the Continents hashmap.</p>

<pre><code>public void createContinents()
{   

    Scanner inputTwo = new Scanner( new File( ""continents.txt"");

while( inputTwo.hasNext())  //continues to create and add countries until their are none next
{   
    String line = inputTwo.nextLine();  //stores the entire line
    Scanner lineScan = new Scanner( line);  //passes the entire line into Scanner
    lineScan.useDelimiter("",""); //sets the Scanner's delimiter pattern

    String name = inputTwo.next();  //stores the first String which is the name of the current continent being created
    System.out.println( "" the name is"" + name);

    int bonusArmies = inputTwo.nextInt();   //stores the second String which is casted into an int for the continent bonus armies
    System.out.println("" the number of bonus armies is"" + bonusArmies);

    ArrayList&lt;Country&gt; memberCountries = new ArrayList&lt;Country&gt;();  //creates an arraylist to hold the member countries of current continent

    while( inputTwo.hasNext())  //goes through the rest of the line to add the member countries until it reaches the end of the line
    {   

        memberCountries.add( countries.get(inputTwo.next()));//gets string name of country and pass it as key to store into temp arraylist of countries         
        System.out.println( ""the member countries"" + memberCountries);
    }

        continent = new Continent( name,  bonusArmies,  memberCountries);   //creates continent
        continents.put(name , continent);   //associates a key to the current continent

}


    inputTwo.close();

When I have a component in a view or partial view, which needs one or more specific template, I include the corresponding templates with <code>Html.Partial</code>. However, there is a problem I need to solve: this way, if a component itself is in a partial, and I have two or more components included in a View, the templates will get included twice or more times, which is undesirable.</p>

<p>I would like to achieve that whenever I need to include templates from partials, I wouldn't have to worry about wether they were already included or not. I could include the same partial with templates two or three times, but at the end, it would appear only once in the rendered View.</p>

After much struggling and reading (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/186631/rest-soap-endpoints-for-a-wcf-service/2295887"">this question</a> helped a lot), I finally got SOAP, JSON and XML (POX) working together.</p>

<p>To simplify, here's my code (to make this example simple, I'm not using interfaces -- I did try this both ways):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ServiceContract()&gt; _
Public Class TestService
    Public Sub New()
    End Sub

    &lt;OperationContract()&gt; _
    &lt;WebGet()&gt; _
    Public Function GetDate() As DateTime
        Return Now
    End Function


    '&lt;WebGet(UriTemplate:=""getdateoffset/{numDays}"")&gt; _
    &lt;OperationContract()&gt; _
    Public Function GetDateOffset(ByVal numDays As Integer) As DateTime
        Return Now.AddDays(numDays)
    End Function

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>and the web.config code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;services&gt;
  &lt;service name=""TestService"" 
           behaviorConfiguration=""TestServiceBehavior""&gt;
    &lt;endpoint address=""soap"" binding=""basicHttpBinding"" contract=""TestService""/&gt;
    &lt;endpoint address=""json"" binding=""webHttpBinding"" behaviorConfiguration=""jsonBehavior"" contract=""TestService""/&gt;
    &lt;endpoint address=""xml"" binding=""webHttpBinding"" behaviorConfiguration=""poxBehavior"" contract=""TestService""/&gt;
    &lt;endpoint address=""mex"" contract=""IMetadataExchange"" binding=""mexHttpBinding"" /&gt;
  &lt;/service&gt;
&lt;/services&gt;
&lt;behaviors&gt;
  &lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;
    &lt;behavior name=""jsonBehavior""&gt;
      &lt;enableWebScript/&gt;
    &lt;/behavior&gt;
    &lt;behavior name=""poxBehavior""&gt;
      &lt;webHttp /&gt;
    &lt;/behavior&gt;
  &lt;/endpointBehaviors&gt;
  &lt;serviceBehaviors&gt;
    &lt;behavior name=""TestServiceBehavior""&gt;
      &lt;serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled=""true""/&gt;
      &lt;serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults=""false""/&gt;
    &lt;/behavior&gt;
  &lt;/serviceBehaviors&gt;
&lt;/behaviors&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This actually works -- I'm able to go to <code>TestService.svc/xml/GetDate</code> for xml, <code>TestService.svc/json/GetDate</code> for json, and point a SOAP client at <code>TestService.svc?wsdl</code> and have the SOAP queries work.</p>

<p>The part I'd like to fix is the queries. I have to use <code>TestService.svc/xml/GetDateOffset?numDays=4</code> instead of <code>TestService.svc/xml/GetDateOffset/4</code>. If I specify the UriTemplate, I get the error:</p>

<p><code>Endpoints using 'UriTemplate' cannot be used with 'System.ServiceModel.Description.WebScriptEnablingBehavior'.</code></p>

<p>But of course without using <code>&lt;enableWebScript/&gt;</code>, JSON doesn't work. </p>

<p>The only other thing I've seen that I think will work is making 3 different services (.svc files), that all implement an interface that specifies the contract, but in the classes specify different WebGet/WebInvoke attributes on each class. This seems like a lot of extra work, that frankly, I don't see why the framework doesn't handle for me. The implementation of the classes would all be the same, except for the attributes, which means over time it would be easy for bugs/changes to get fixed/done in one implementation but not the others, leading to inconsistent behaviour when using the JSON vs SOAP implementation for example.</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong here? Am I taking a totally wrong approach and misusing WCF? Is there a better way to do this? </p>

<p>With my experience doing web stuff, I think it should be possible for <em>some</em> kind of framework to handle this ... I even have an idea in my head of how to build it. It just seems like WCF is supposed to be doing this, and I don't really want to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the stream socket API does not support setting low level socket options. However, this is something that I have to do. Likewise, the socket API does not support using standard function calls like <code>fread</code>, <code>fwrite</code> and <code>fclose</code>, making it incompatible with the rest of my code.</p>

<p>PHP 5.4 introduced the <a href=""http://php.net/socket_import_stream"">socket_import_stream</a> function. This allows you to take a stream socket and get the underlying socket resource. My plan was to use this to create the stream socket, get the socket, set some options on it, and then continue using the original stream socket.</p>

<p>The reason this did not work for me is that I need to set the options before binding. The only way to bind a stream socket is to use <a href=""http://php.net/stream_socket_server"">stream_socket_server</a>, which already performs the bind. That's why I could not use it.</p>

<p>I am now looking for the inverse of <code>socket_import_stream</code>, so that I can convert my socket resource into a stream socket. I have not been able to find such a function, but I'm hoping that some very smart people can help me. Or submit a patch to the PHP source that does it. Or give me hints on writing such a patch.</p>

<p>EDIT: I have some code that acts on a PHP stream to parse DNS packets from it. I want to re-use that code with a multicast-enabled socket. I cannot enable multicast on a stream socket, and I cannot use stream functions on a raw socket.</p>

<p>EDIT2: I want to use this stream with <code>stream_select</code>, so custom stream wrappers are not an option, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Scenario: I'm in charge of 1 database - 10 tables with 10 Primary Keys. Every month, our code team publishes updates to the tables. I am suppose to drop the tables and generate scripts to create the updated tables. </p>

<p>Rather than just drop the old tables and stored procedures, I want to rename my current tables to preserve the structure/data for whatever reason.</p>

<p>In my database, I have an additional table called ""TableUpdateList"" with 1 column ""TableName"" and 10 rows - each row containing the name of the updated column (Row 1 = TableName1, Row 2 = TableName2, Row 3 = TableName3)</p>

<p>I would like to be able to ""loop"" through the TableUpdateList Table and insert each value into a set of SQL statements. </p>

<p>For Example, here are the SQL statements I want to run:</p>

<pre><code>--drop the previous backup table
IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where TABLE_NAME = '*TableName1*'+'_Old') DROP TABLE TableName1_Old

-- rename the current tables to _old 
EXEC sp_rename *TableName1*, TableName1_Old;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to find a way to scroll through the column of my TableUpdateList and run the above two statements filling in where I've italicized with whatever value is present in that row.</p>

<p>Just taking a wild stab because I think in order to get an answer here, you have to try something so here is my pseudo-code:</p>

<pre><code>Declare @TableNames as List

For i in @TableNames

IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where TABLE_NAME = '*i*'+'_Old') DROP TABLE TableName1_Old

-- rename the current tables to _old 
EXEC sp_rename *i*, TableName1_Old;
</code></pre>

<p>Oi, thanks in advance for any help or a point in the right direction to where I could do some further reading about the above online. </p>

Is there no workaround yet for Axis 1.4?</p>

<p><strong>Problem Definition</strong></p>

<p>For instance;</p>

<p><strong>1-</strong> We have a soap response definition('ResponseGetCustomerInfo') in our wsdl while development[with <em>Axis 1.4</em>]:</p>

<pre><code>...
  &lt;xs:element name=""ResponseGetCustomerInfo""&gt;
    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:element ref=""ns1:CustomerID""/&gt;
        &lt;xs:element ref=""ns1:CustomerUsername""/&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
  &lt;xs:element name=""CustomerID"" type=""xs:integer""/&gt;
  &lt;xs:element name=""CustomerUsername"" type=""xs:string""/&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2-</strong> Is good to see that response is parsable when we get like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?&gt; 
&lt;soap:Envelope 
    xmlns:soap=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" 
    xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" 
    xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""&gt;
    &lt;soap:Body&gt;
        &lt;ResponseGetCustomerInfo xmlns=""http://tempUri.org/""&gt;
            &lt;CustomerID&gt;1&lt;/CustomerID&gt;
            &lt;CustomerUsername&gt;raki&lt;/CustomerUsername&gt;
        &lt;/ResponseGetCustomerInfo&gt;
    &lt;/soap:Body&gt;
&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>3-</strong> After some time, our service provider changed the service response and adds new output fields to response and <strong>we don't know when or why</strong>;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?&gt; 
&lt;soap:Envelope 
    xmlns:soap=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" 
    xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" 
    xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""&gt;
    &lt;soap:Body&gt;
        &lt;ResponseGetCustomerInfo xmlns=""http://tempUri.org/""&gt;
            &lt;CustomerID&gt;1&lt;/CustomerID&gt;
            &lt;CustomerUsername&gt;raki&lt;/CustomerUsername&gt;
            &lt;CustomerName&gt;Raki&lt;/CustomerName&gt;
            &lt;CustomerSurname&gt;Bandao&lt;/CustomerSurname&gt;
        &lt;/ResponseGetCustomerInfo&gt;
    &lt;/soap:Body&gt;
&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>4-</strong> New response <em>theoretically compatible with older version because of no field neither deleted nor changed</em>. But Axis can not parse the response:</p>

<pre><code>""SAXException: Invalid Element ... ""
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>I don't want to update wsdl and regenerate web service client again</em></strong>. So, Is there any way to skip ""Unexpected[newly added] elements"" in the response? or any workaround?</p>

<p>I am trying many ways, but could not find any solution yet.</p>

<li><p>I went to <a href=""http://curl.haxx.se/download.html#Win32"" rel=""nofollow"">http://curl.haxx.se/download.html#Win32</a> and downloaded <code>Win32 2000/XP 7.32.0 libcurl SSL</code>. It may be obvious, but this is  <code>libcurl -v 7.32</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>I unzipped the aforementioned file into <code>c:\libcurl</code> ( so the bin, lib, and whatnot are directly in libcurl ).</p></li>
<li><p>I added <code>c:\libcurl\bin</code> to the <code>PATH</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>While in my app's working directory, I told bundler where to find the cURL dependencies with <code>bundle config build.curb --with-curl-lib=C:\libcurl\bin --with-curl-include=C:\libcurl\include</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>I set the version of nokogiri to <code>gem 'nokogiri', '~&gt; 1.5.3'</code> in my gemfile, as it doesn't like the current -v 1.6.0.  This installs <code>nokogiri -v 1.5.10</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>I set the version of feedzirra to <code>gem 'feedzirra', github: 'pauldix/feedzirra', ref: '80cd357'</code> in my gemfile.</p></li>
<li><p>This installs some dependencies:</p>

<p>Using curb (0.8.4) - trying <code>gem 'curb', '0.8.1'</code> and <code>gem 'curb', '~&gt; 0.7.15'</code> doesn't resolve the issue, just a heads up</p>

<p>Using loofah (1.2.1)</p>

<p>Using sax-machine (0.2.0.rc1)</p>

<p>Using feedzirra (0.2.0.rc2) from git://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra.git (at 80cd357) - obviously</p></li>
</ul>

<p><code>bundle</code> is a success! Problem isn't with <code>bundle</code>, though.  I can get the stuff to install.  When trying <code>rails s</code> or <code>rails c</code>, I get the following: ( <code>curb_core.so</code> does exist, though )</p>

<p>I have no trouble for models with a single grouping variable, but the bootstrapping method I was following (<a href=""http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/melogit.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/melogit.htm</a>) essentially broke when I added in an extra grouping variable.</p>

<p>I investigated bootMer (a newly implemented part of lme4), with the same outcome.</p>

<p>Here's an example of the problem:</p>

<p>---------------------------- EDITED to include a reproducible example ---------------------------- </p>

<p>The helpful comments to this question and working through the example gave the answer - it is not the addition of a second grouping variable <em>per se</em>, but missingness in a grouping variable that causes the issue.</p>

<p>Here is a worked example for anyone else who runs into this. </p>

<p>I'm having trouble with an application I'm working on. I'm pretty new in codeigniter and the i18n internationalization. I want to know why the following is happening and how can I manage to fix it (I'm not just asking for 'teh codez'):</p>

<p>Codeigniter has this behavior when I enter some url:</p>

<pre><code>if i enter:                  it redirects to:
site.com                     site.com/default_language/default_controller
site.com/default_language    site.com/default_language (and loads the default controller)
site.com/language            site.com/language (and loads the default controller)
</code></pre>

<p>Want I want to do is to change that behaviour to:</p>

<pre><code>if i enter:            it redirects to:
site.com               site.com/default_language/default_controller
site.com/any_language  site.com/any_language/default_controller
</code></pre>

<p>My languages in MY_Lang.php are:</p>

<pre><code>$languages = array(
  'es' =&gt; 'spanish',
  'en' =&gt; 'english'
);
</code></pre>

<p>And my routes.php:</p>

<pre><code>$route['default_controller'] = ""cover"";
$route['^(es|en)/(.+)$'] = ""$2"";
$route['^(es|en)$'] = $route['default_controller'];
</code></pre>

<p>Please let me know if you need another piece of code.</p>

<p>Thanks and greetings from Argentina!</p>

I'm working with winsock, learning some things about networking and protocol devlopment, and i've reached an impasse. I'm right now doing a server that blocks at an accept call, but has another thread in the background waiting for user input and handling user input. this user input is used for commands like send,ping, and say, etc. but now i would like a command called exit that will shut down winsock, release all open connections, and then end the program. problem is, this accept thread is still blocking. </p>

<p>so here's the questions. 1) is there anyway to stop a winsock function from blocking while it's called, and 2) is something like this in non-blocking mode:</p>

<pre><code>while(m_continue)
{
      Sleep(1);
      tempsock = accept(m_listenSock, NULL, NULL);
      if(tempsock != INVALID_SOCKET)
      {
            if(WSAGetLastError() == WSAEWOULDBLOCK)
                  continue;
            else 
                  return 1;
      }
      break;
{

<p>So. I started a small project in JSF. After failing to test the relationship between UIComponents and Managed Beans using JSFUnit and Apache Cactus (which is another sad story), I hoped to be able to at least test the domain model units. Alas.</p>

<p>I have this POJO:</p>

<pre><code>public class AppointmentFormBean implements Serializable, Observed{
private Date selectedDate;
private ArrayList&lt;VGObserver&gt; observers;
/**
 * Creates a new instance of AppointmentFormBean
 */
public AppointmentFormBean() {
    observers = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
}

public Date getSelectedDate() {
    return selectedDate;
}

public void setSelectedDate(Date selectedDate) {
    this.selectedDate = selectedDate;
    notifyVGObservers();
}

@Override
public void registerVGObserver(VGObserver o) {
    this.observers.add(o);
}

@Override
public void removeVGObserver(VGObserver o) {
    int i = observers.indexOf(o);
    if(i&gt;=0)
        observers.remove(o);
}

@Override
public void notifyVGObservers() {
    observers.stream().map((observer1) -&gt; (VGObserver) observer1).forEach((observer) -&gt; {
        observer.update(selectedDate);
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>(I intentionally omitted JSF annotations - they are irrelevant for the test I ran)</p>

<p>The Observed interface that this POJO implements looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public interface Observed {
public void registerVGObserver(VGObserver o);
public void removeVGObserver(VGObserver o);
public void notifyVGObservers();
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Yip, copied from Head First Design Patterns, who had read it :-)</p>

<p>VGObserver, mentioned above - is another interface, which will ""listen"" to the changes in the classes implementing Observed:</p>

<pre><code>public interface VGObserver {
public void update(Date selectedDate);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>I have big plans for this design, as eventually VGObserver (concrete class implementing it) will try to retrieve a REST resource - weather for the passed date. But we digress.</p>

<p>Finally I've built my test class to check that each time <strong>setSelectedBean(...)</strong> is called, VGObserver's <strong>update(...)</strong> is triggered. I used Easy Mock to mock VGObserver interface:</p>

<pre><code>public class AppointmentBeanObservableTest {

private AppointmentFormBean form;
private VGObserver mockObserver;
private final SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(""yyyy-MM-dd"");

@Before
public void setUp() {
    form = new AppointmentFormBean();
    mockObserver = createMock(""observer"", VGObserver.class);
    form.registerVGObserver(mockObserver);
}

@After
public void tearDown() {
    verify(mockObserver);
}

@Test
public void testIocForVGObserved() throws ParseException {        
    Date aDate = sdf.parse(""2015-09-15"");
    form.setSelectedDate(aDate);
    mockObserver.update(aDate);
    EasyMock.expectLastCall().anyTimes();
    replay(mockObserver);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Unfortunately this test royally fails and there was nothing I could find to mend it. Below is the output and project link on github:</p>

<pre><code>Time elapsed: 0.091 sec  &lt;&lt;&lt; FAILURE!

<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=cat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=cat</a><code>+-dog</code></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=baseball"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=baseball</a><code>+-dog</code></p>

<p><strong>CODE</strong>:Credit goes to krowe.</p>

<p><code>dog</code> replaced with <code>-torrent-watch-download</code></p>

<p>The problem is that you MUST type the search string in the address bar for this to work. The problem with typing into Google search directly is that the onload event doesn't fire.
I want this script to work in Google search</p>

<p>Any room for improvement?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Suddenly, for no reason I can pinpoint, I am occasionally getting this error when trying to bring up a page:</p>

<p>The error doesn't occur at any specific place, it just seems to appear every 5-10 page loads or so. It usually goes away after a refresh, although sometimes I may need to refresh a couple of times.</p>

<p>Has anyone encountered this error before? Is it just some flakiness in mySQL on my Mac? (I also tried exporting the current DB and re-importing it under a different name and assigning that new DB, but the problem persists. I don't know of a way to test and ""repair"" a MySQL DB on a Mac.)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>

<p>My question is, does a vtable exists only for a class that has a virtual function or does it also exist for classes derived from that class. </p>

<p>e.g</p>

<pre><code>class Base{
    public:
        virtual void print(){cout&lt;&lt;""Base Print\n"";}
};
class Derived:public Base{
    public:
        void print(){cout&lt;&lt;""Derived print\n"";}
};

//From main.cpp 
Base* b = new Derived;
b-&gt;print();
</code></pre>

<p>Question: Had there been no vtable for class derived then the output would not have been ""derived print"". So IMO there exists a vtable for any class that has virtual function declared and also in classes inheriting from that class. Is this correct ?</p>

<p>... And the moment it tries to play the music, it crashes. Not a traceback, but ""pythonw.exe has stopped working"". I'm not sure how MIDI works, but i think that the music and the output are conflicting because they're trying to use the same devices.

<p>where <code>hostReachable()</code> is a function for checking connectivity using xhr request.</p>

<p>The problem is now after the thisform.submit(); the form submission event seems not triggered again. So the codes inside <code>if(progress === 1)</code> is never run.  Why is it so? What's wrong with my codes? Thanks!</p>

<p>So, to my problem. I have a working Rest API running on IIS 7. From what i understood, i have to add a binding to the server for https. So i created my custom certificate, and added the binding. In the IIS manager there where now 2 bindings, the http and the https one.</p>

<p>But, as soon as i did this, i couldn't access the webservice over http, or https. Both gave the same error:</p>

<p>The provided URI scheme 'https' is invalid; expected 'http'.

<p>So when a customer signs up, I'll create an account in dbo. I'll then check if their subdomain exists as a schema in the database, if not, I'll create the schema and ideally run the migrations.</p>

I'm working as a Java developer on a team of 3 others. The company primarily sells a service to for businesses/business-type people to use in communicating with each other.</p>

<p>One of the main things I have been, and will be working on, is the main website for the company - from which the service is sold, existing users login to check their service and pay their bills, new users can sign up for a trial, etc. Currently this is a JSP application deployed on Tomcat, with access to a database done thru a persistence layer written by the company itself.</p>

<p>A repeated and growing frustration I am having here (and I'm pretty happy with the job overall, so this isn't an ""oh no I don't like my job""-type post) is the lack of any larger design or architecture for this web application. The app is made up of several dozen JSP pages, with almost no logic existing in Servlets or Beans or any other sort of framework. Many of the JSP pages are thousands of lines of code, they <code>jsp:include</code> other JSP pages, business logic is mixed in with the HTML, frequently used snippets of code (such as obtaining a web service connection) is cut and paste rather than reused, etc. In other words, the application is a mess.</p>

<p>There have been some rumblings within the company of trying to re-architect this site so that it fits MVC better; I think that the developers and higher-ups are beginning to realize that this current pattern of spaghetti code isn't sustainable or very easily scalable to add more features for the users. The higher-ups and developers are wary of completely re-writing the thing (with good reason, since this would mean several weeks or months of work re-writing existing functionality), but we've had some discussions of (slowly) re-writing certain areas of the site into a new framework.</p>

<p>What are some of the best strategies to enable moving the application and codebase into this direction? How can I as a developer really help move this along, and quickly, without seeming like the jerk-y new guy who comes into a job and tells everyone that what they've written is crap? Are there any proven strategies or experiences that you've used in your own job experience when you've encountered this sort of thing?</p>

Few details:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python's code doesn't use PyObjC at all, just Python's basics.</li>
<li>There are several Python's files with similar functionality each (aka “variations on a theme”).</li>
</ul>

<h1>NSBundle</h1>

<p>Encapsulating each *.py into *.bundle was the first thing that has came into mind.</p>

<p>PythonClass.py:</p>

<pre><code>import objc
NSObject = objc.lookUpClass('NSObject')

class PythonClass(NSObject):
    def Function(self):
        print(""Python is speaking!"")
</code></pre>

<p>setup.py:</p>

<pre><code>from distutils.core import setup
import py2app

setup(
    plugin = ['PythonClass.py'],
)
</code></pre>

<p>Terminal command: <code>python setup.py py2app -s -p objc</code></p>

<p>It works fine, but there are several problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Large *.bundle size</strong>. Even though <a href=""http://www.hardcoded.net/articles/embedded-pyobjc"" rel=""nofollow"">Foundation is not imported</a>, and bundle is semi standalone (flag ""-s""), the size of the *.bundle is ~1MB. Is there any other way to reduce the size?</li>
<li><strong>PyObjC dependance</strong>. Class doesn't use objc, but if we don't subclass <code>NSObject</code> then, on Objective-C side, <code>[bundle principalClass]</code> is <code>(Null)</code> and <code>PythonClass</code> cannot be instantiated. Is there a way to avoid using <code>NSObject</code> in *.py?</li>
</ul>

<h1>CFBundle</h1>

<p>I have also been thinking about using <code>CFBundle</code>, but <code>CFBundleGetFunctionPointerForName(...)</code> always returns <code>NULL</code> (of course, in this case, *.py contains a function, not a class). I couldn't find any material on this matter. Maybe some of you are more lucky.</p>

<p>Is there a better way of embedding Python into Objective-C?</p>

<p>However, I know have a requirement for doing validations that are a bit more complex, so I have moved them onto the server side. The server side returns basically a list of ConstraintViolations with the message and path to the error field.</p>

<p>So, the basic flow is:</p>

<pre><code>1. Make server call to get list of constraint violations
2. Call editorDriver.setConstraintViolations(violations) 
3. Display errors
</code></pre>

<p>This is where the problems start. I have two pages in my application, the first ties to a simple object so my error path is something like 'applicationDetails.type' and the error message gets displayed at the type field perfectly.</p>

<p>However, the second page is let's say a LIST of contact details so the error path I get back is 'contactDetails[0].firstName'. This doesn't work!! The editor returns false when calling the hasErrors() method and I can even see when calling setConstraintViolations on the editor driver that they aren't recorded!</p>

<p>The weird thing is that the default client side validation returns the same path and that works! Even weirder is that if I 'mock' the error messages/paths coming from the server on the client side (i.e I remove the call to the server) this also works!</p>

<p>It seems that as soon as I make the call to the server something gets messed up in the editor hierarchy/runtime management/request factory that causes these error paths (with an index) to not be recorded properly.</p>

<p>Has anyone come across this and know the reason for it?</p>

<li>If any user try a direct access to this file he/she will get error or 404 any other message</li>
</ul>

<p>Here this <code>comment.php</code> is just an example. The libs folder contains lots of files, and the above applies to all of them. My preference is to use a .htacces method or a mode-rewrite of the folder like 666,777 etc.
I know this is not a real questions aksing just to improve security make almost sercure sites.</p>

The question is, given this first block of code and that Sandwich implements Edible, which of the following statements are legal?</p>

<pre><code>Sandwich sub = new Sandwich();
Rectangle cerealBox = new Rectangle(20,30,20,10);
Edible e = null;

e = sub;
sub = e;
sub = (Sandwich) e;
sub = (Sandwich) cerealBox;
e = cerealBox;
e = (Edible) cerealBox;
e = (Rectangle) cerealBox;
e = (Rectangle) null;
e = (Edible) sub;
cerealBox = (Rectangle) new Object();
</code></pre>

<p>My current understanding is that the first statement is true because a sub has the required elements to make up an edible Object, hence it does not work the other way round for the second statement. And with the third statement casting does allow this to work. But the fourth doesn't because cerealBox doesn't apply to Sandwich. Then the last two do work because of the casting. But apparently the 6th one works?</p>

<p>Sorry about my terrible explanation of what I know, any help would be appreciated.</p>

    visit job_specs_path
    within( find('tr', text: @job_spec.name) ) { click_link 'run_now' }

<p>After clicking the link 'run_now', a job is launched and the user is redirected to the <code>launched_jobs_path</code>, which has a Datatable that uses some AJAX to pull currently running jobs.  This test passes.  However, I wanted to add to the test to check to make sure that the job wasn't already running before clicking the 'run_now' button (which would give me a false positive).  I started playing around with it, but then I noticed that even simply putting <code>visit launched_jobs_path</code> before <code>visit job_specs_path</code> would cause the test to fail with the error</p>

<pre><code>Failure/Error: expect(find('tr', text: @job_spec.name)).to have_content(/(running|success)/)

The reason for this is I want to be able to have plug and play capability and be able to load different functionality into my app.  Perhaps the user role determines what functionality is loaded, or perhaps I want to tailor my app for a given client.</p>

<p>Here's an example of the contents of one of my pluggable JavaScript file:</p>

myApp.ViewModelRegistry =
{
    BaseViewModel: { JavaScriptPath: ""/Scripts/ViewModels/BaseViewModel.js""},
    LoginViewModel:{ JavaScriptPath: ""/Scripts/ViewModels/LoginViewModel.js""}
};
</code></pre>

<pre><code>    InitializeApp: function ()
    {
        //REGISTER VIEW MODELS
        for (var viewModelName in myApp.ViewModelRegistry)
        {
            var registeredModel = myApp.ViewModelRegistry[viewModelName];

            $.getScript(registeredModel.JavaScriptPath, function (data, textStatus, jqxhr)

            });
        }

        console.log(myApp);
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>My goal is to load the JavaScript function from the JS file into the myApp scope.  Each pluggable JS file is scoped to myApp.  I thought simply using jQuery's getScript to load the JS file would automatically update the myApp scope since all pluggable JS files are designed to that scope.  However, the console.log(myApp) doesn't reveal the code from the JS files.  What am I missing? Is this even feasible?</p>

<li>An EJB 3.0 compliant project, <code>myEjbProject</code>  </li>
<li>A Dynamic Web Project, <code>myWebProject</code></li>

<p>I'm injecting an EJB session bean <code>mySessionBeanPackage.mySessionBean</code> from <code>myEjbProject</code> into a servlet <code>myServletPackage.myServlet</code> in <code>myWebProject</code> and then (in the servlet) calling a simple method defined in the session bean.</p>

<p>I've provided <code>myWebProject</code> with a reference to <code>myEjbProject</code> (using the Properties -> Project References dialog). However, for some reason, the server is <strong>unable</strong> to find the session bean. The exact error I get is:</p>

  <p>SEVERE: Class [ LmySessionBeanPackage/mySessionBean ] not found. Error while loading [ class myServletPackage.myServlet ]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that <em>both</em> the EJB project and the web project have been published to the server and I've double-checked that the class file generated for the bean is, in fact, present on the server (so I can't think of a reason why the server isn't able to find them).</p>

<p>I use it in my application, here's a conceptual sample:</p>

<pre><code>.config(['$routeProvider', 'securityAuthorizationProvider',
        function ($routeProvider, securityAuthorizationProvider) {
              $routeProvider.when('/test', {
                  templateUrl: '/myCorrespondingView.tpl.html',

        }])
</code></pre>

<p>So, this code expects to display <code>/myCorrespondingView.tpl.html</code> content if and only if <code>securityAuthorizationProvider.requireAuthenticatedUser</code> is resolved (promise term).</p>

<p>My expectation is: I don't want to change the URL to <code>http://myApp.com/test</code> if this promise in <code>resolve</code> part is rejected. The reason is simple, I don't want to uselessly reload the previous controller if my rejection logic is to let the user on his current page (thus needing a redirection to this latter) .</p>

<p>Is there an efficient way to achieve this with the <code>resolve</code> property other than shifting the conditional logic at the source, meaning into the previous controller?</p>

I'm building an app based upon the ""Scrolling"" sample code that Apple provided. All is working very well. The nature of the images that I want to display, would make it desirable, if the order of the images is reversed, and that the first visible image is the right-most, rather than the left most. Basically, the user should scroll back, from right to left, rather than from left to right.
But now: I don't understand the syntax Apple is using, and I hope someone can explain to me what is going on. Here are the relevant parts of the sample app:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];

    // load all the images from our bundle and add them to the scroll view
    NSUInteger i;
    for (i = 1; i &lt;= kNumImages; i++)
    {
    	NSString *imageName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""image%d.jpg"", i];
    	UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed:imageName];
    	UIImageView *imageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:image];

    	// setup each frame to a default height and width, it will be properly placed when we call ""updateScrollList""
    	CGRect rect = imageView.frame;
    	rect.size.height = kScrollObjHeight;
    	rect.size.width = kScrollObjWidth;
    	imageView.frame = rect;
    	imageView.tag = i;	// tag our images for later use when we place them in serial fashion
    	[scrollView1 addSubview:imageView];
    	[imageView release];
    }

    [self layoutScrollImages];	// now place the photos in serial layout within the scrollview

}

- (void)layoutScrollImages
{
    UIImageView *view = nil;
    NSArray *subviews = [scrollView1 subviews];

    // reposition all image subviews in a horizontal serial fashion
    CGFloat curXLoc = 0;
    for (view in subviews)
    {
    	if ([view isKindOfClass:[UIImageView class]] &amp;&amp; view.tag &gt; 0)
    	{
    		CGRect frame = view.frame;
    		frame.origin = CGPointMake(curXLoc, 0);
    		view.frame = frame;

    		curXLoc += (kScrollObjWidth);
    	}
    }

    // set the content size so it can be scrollable
    [scrollView1 setContentSize:CGSizeMake((kNumImages * kScrollObjWidth), [scrollView1 bounds].size.height)];
}

The URL I am using to request an access code is in this format:</p>

<p><code>https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&amp;client_id={client id}&amp;redirect_uri={App URL}&amp;approval_prompt=force&amp;scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/coordinate</code></p>

<p>The issue I am having is that the consent screen just says ""This app would like to: Have offline access"". It does not mention granting permissions for interacting with Google Maps Coordinate. I am starting to think this a bug on Google's side, because if i try to get a read only token by adding <code>.readonly</code> to the end of the url, the consent screen shows ""This app would like to: View your Google Coordinate Jobs"". Similarly, if I replace <code>coordinate</code> with <code>docs</code> or <code>drive</code>, I get the correct consent screen where the app requests permissions to access and modify Google Drive content. </p>

<p>If I get a token using the coordinate scope with the ""Have offline access"" permissions and then use that token to try and make requests to coordinate, I just get ""Insufficient Permissions"" errors. </p>

<p>The issue only seems to be happening when trying to get an access code for Maps Coordinate. Has anyone else experienced this issue?</p>

<p>So basically the problem is that every time the, 'send message' method is triggered the message is sent out multiple times(the amount of times the page is refreshed) - > I make sure that a new socket is not created when a page is refreshed by the same user, to avoid multiple messages.

So, we got this problem on a Virtuemart shop, running version 2.5.23 of Joomla with VM 2.6.10.</p>

<p>Server info:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PHP Built On Linux web04 3.13.0-35-generic #62~precise1-Ubuntu</strong></li>
<li><strong>Database Version:</strong>  5.1.73-0ubuntu0.10.04.1-log</li>
<li><strong>Database Collation:</strong> utf8_general_ci</li>
<li><strong>PHP Version:</strong> 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.14</li>
<li><strong>Web Server:</strong> Apache</li>
<li><strong>WebServer to PHP Interface:</strong> apache2handler</li>
<li><strong>Joomla! Version:</strong> Joomla! 2.5.23 Stable [ Ember ] 24-July-2014 14:00 GMT</li>
</ul>

<p>So this is not sending mail anywhere. We got it on a testserver and over there, life is good. It's sending e-mail. The testserver is running PHP 5.24.</p>

<p>I've used this to see if this checks out:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$to = ""dontsentmemail@gmail.com"";
if( mail( $to , 'This is a test message.' , 'Is this working?' ) ) {
    echo 'Email sent.';
} else {
    echo 'Email failed to send.';
}

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is working fine. And I'm about to pull out all my hair. We've tried SMTP mail handling, and again, working like a charm on the testserver but it won't work on the live site.</p>

<p>does anybody know if is VM/joomla is using mail() directly or maybe using JUtility::sendMail() as default, and if we can change that, to make it work? Anyone got any ideas?</p>

I have tried compiling the project using makefiles and trying to create a library from all the .o files
This seemed to not work as expected. 
I then asked adacore support and they pointed me in the direction of using .gpr files for both the ada and c projects and withing in the ada.gpr that should create a library. This almost worked but when it tries to compile the ada I get undefined references.</p>

<p>What I have tried:
Command line:</p>

<pre><code>ar rc libmy_lib.a *.o

<p>and when I try to read what is in the lib</p>

<pre><code>ld libmy_lib.a

<p>When i run the command
gprbuild c_main.gpr</p>

<p>I got 2 different errors:
First being undefined references to some packages that are part of my ada code and come that at gnat .adb files I didnt know existed. So broken library I figure.
Second being that fields of certain packages cant be found/dont exist even though the code compiles fine and runs. It gives me errors stating that the fields dont exist in the ada code.</p>

<p>TLDR:
I have an ada project in 3 different directories and I want to create a library from them. Then link to a C testing program. Ultimately I just have to deliver the library file. Command line would be best. I do not want to deal with project files.</p>

So I have provided a link to the script. Just enter the information I provided below in the text boxes, wait for the script to finish, then refresh the page.

<p>Step one in the screenshot creates a list of urls for step two (the curl class) to use. </p>

<p>Step two (the curl class) simply curl_multi's the list of urls and then saves preg_matched information to variables.</p>

<p>And if you saw what I was trying to show you - every time the script is run it prints only a few of the character levels and classes. The script at one point did print out everything without missing any information. I am not sure if the script is just timing out and skipping the handle or what is going on...</p>

<p>I do know that each of the links from the url list works because if you refresh the script enough times you can see that every row does eventually fill in with enough given refreshes.</p>

<p>I hope I was able to be clear enough because I honestly I am not sure what is happening to cause this. </p>

<li>Create a constructor for the Node class and pass the degree in every time I need to construct a Node.</li>

<p>The queue is populated really fast ... and when I say fast I mean fast ... so fast that I'm experiencing problems with some particular part. </p>

<p>Each item in the queue gets a ""category"" attached to it and then is passed to a WCf endpoint to be processed then saved in a remote db.</p>

<p>This is presenting a bit of a problem. </p>

<p>The ""queue"" can be processed in the millions of items per minute whereas the WCF endpoint will only realistically handle about 1000 to 1200 items per second and many of those are ""stacked"" in order to wait for a slot to dump them to the db.</p>

<p>My WCF client is configured so that the call is fire and forget (deliberate) my problem is that when the call is made occasionally a timeout occurs and thats when the headaches begin.</p>

<p>The thread just seems to stop after timeout no dropping in to my catch block nothing ... just sits there, whats even more confusing is that this is an intermittent thing, this only happens when the queue is dealing with extreme loads and the WCF endpoint is over taxed, and even in that scenario it's only about once a fortnight this happens. </p>

<p>This code is constantly running on the server, round the clock 24/7.</p>

<p>So ... my question ...
How can I identify the edge case that is causing my problem so that I can resolve it?</p>

<p>Some extra info:</p>

<p>The client calling the WCF endpoint seems to automatically ""throttle itself"" by the fact that i'm limiting the number of threads making calls, and the code hangs about until a call is considered complete (i'm thinking this is a http level thing as im not asking the service for a result of my method call).</p>

<p>The db is talked to with EF which seems to never open more than a fixed number of connections to the db (quite a low number too which is cool) and the WCF endpoint from the call reception back seems super reliable. </p>

<p>The problem seems to be coming off the queue processor to the WCf endpoint. </p>

<p>The queue processor has a single instance of my WCF endpoint client which it reuses for all calls ... (is it good practice to rebuild this endpoint per call? - bear in mind number of calls here).</p>

<p>Final note:</p>

<p>It's a peculiar ""module"" of functionality, under heavy load for hours at a time it's stable, but for some reason this odd thing happens resulting in the whole lot just stopping and not recovering. The call is wrapped in a try catch, but seemingly even if the catch is hit (which isn't guaranteed) the code doesn't recover / drop out as expected ... it just hangs.</p>

<p>Any ideas? </p>

<p>Please let me know if there's anything else I can add to help resolve this. </p>

<p>Edit 1:</p>

<p>binding - basicHttpBinding</p>

<p>error handling - no code written other than wrapping the WCF call in a try catch.</p>

<p><strong>For reference, here is the TangoMesh_Experimental Struct from the <a href=""https://github.com/googlesamples/tango-examples-c/blob/master/tango_client_api/include/tango_client_api.h#L1131"" rel=""nofollow"">API</a>:</strong></p>

<pre><code>    // A mesh, described by vertices and face indices, with optional per-vertex
    // normals and colors.
    typedef struct TangoMesh_Experimental {
    // Index into a three-dimensional fixed grid.
    int32_t index[3];

    // Array of vertices. Each vertex is an {x, y, z} coordinate triplet, in
    // meters.
    float (*vertices)[3];

    // Array of faces. Each face is an index triplet into the vertices array.
    uint32_t (*faces)[3];

    // Array of per-vertex normals. Each normal is a normalized {x, y, z} vector.
    float (*normals)[3];

    // Array of per-vertex colors. Each color is a 4-tuple of 8-bit {R, G, B, A}
    // values.
    uint8_t (*colors)[4];

    // Number of vertices, describing the size of the vertices array.
    uint32_t num_vertices;

    // Number of faces, describing the size of the faces array.
    uint32_t num_faces;

    // If true, each vertex will have an associated normal. In that case, the
    // size of the normals array will be equal to num_vertices. Otherwise, the
    // size of the normals array will be 0.
    bool has_normals;

    // If true, each vertex will have an associated color. In that case, the size
    // of the colors array will be equal to num_vertices. Otherwise, the size of
    // the colors array will be 0.
    bool has_colors;
    } TangoMesh_Experimental;
</code></pre>

<p>My current understanding of this struct is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The three pointers in <code>float (*vertices)[3];</code> point to the addresses at the start of three chuncks of memory for the x, y, and z coordinates for the vertices for the mesh (the same is true for normals and colors colors).  A specific vertex is composed of an x, y, and z component found at a specific index in the three arrays.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, the <code>uint32_t (*faces)[3]</code> array has three pointers to the beginning of three chunks of memory, but a specific set of three elements here instead contains index numbers that indicate which three vertices (from the vertices array (each with three coordinates)) make up that face.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The current status is I am able to extract the mesh, and print some of it to the console, then crashes without errors</strong></p>

<pre><code>PointCloudApp: PointCloudApp: num_vertices: 8044 
</code></pre>

<p>If I omit the last line I added in point_cloud_app.cc (#4, above), the app doesn't crash.  I am able to access the vertex data and do something with it, but printing it using LOGE causes a crash 9 times out of 10.  Occasionally, it does print the value correctly without crashing.  Could the vertex data have holes or invalid values?</p>

<p>I have tried returning test_float from JNI back to java, but it crashes again when I try to do so.</p>

<p>Suggestions?</p>

<p>It seems like the version of the dependency was updated too. I tried to change it back to 1.54 but it didn't solve the problem either. I get errors like:</p>

<p>IntelliSense: cannot open source file ""boost/archive/text_oarchive.hpp""</p>

<p>I tried including it with both </p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;boost/archive/text_oarchive.hpp&gt;

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>#include ""boost/archive/text_oarchive.hpp""

<p>How do I solve this?</p>

<p>EDIT1: Additional info is, that I have started using GitHub instead of TortoiseGit. Don't know if this matters.</p>

<p>Commads to reproduce:</p>

<p>in <code>psql &lt;tablename&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>create or replace function macaddr_intext(text) returns macaddr as $$
select macaddr_in($1::cstring);
$$ language sql immutable;

create cast (text as macaddr) with function macaddr_intext(text) as implicit;

create or replace function inet_intext(text) returns inet as $$

$$ language sql immutable;

create cast (text as inet) with function inet_intext(text) as implicit;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update2:</strong></p>

<p>I narrowed it down to a permission error because if I run as user <code>postgres</code>:</p>

<pre><code>mydb=# create table test(i inet, m macaddr)
CREATE TABLE
mydb=# insert into test values ('1.1.1.1'::text, '00:00:00:00:00:00'::text);
INSERT 0 1
</code></pre>

<p>but if I try to run it as the user that actually tries to insert</p>

<pre><code>mydb=&gt; insert into test values ('1.1.1.1'::text, '00:00:00:00:00:00'::text);
ERROR: permission denied for relation test
</code></pre>

<p>when setting up the database I had run:</p>

<pre><code>template1=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydb to myuser;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update3:</strong></p>

<p>Update2 turned out to be only the problem because the created table was owned by <code>postgres</code> instead of <code>myuser</code></p>

<p>Currently, 8 results are shown on my page from the database.</p>

<p>As soon as the user scrolls, a load more button appears and on clicking it runs an ajax request to another php page which loads in 8 more results. This works in practice, but i cant figure out how to go about loading e,g, 8 - 16, then 16, 24 etc.</p>

<p>How should i got about changing my LIMIT claus to increase the number by e.g. 8 each time so that the next set of results are fetched. (Im testing it with just 1 result loaded each time so that i can see if its changing them easier.)</p>

<p>So here the ajax call:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $('#loadmorebuilds-div').click(function() {
        $.ajax({
           url: 'includes/loadmorebuilds.php',
           success: function(html) {
              var el = jQuery(html);
              jQuery(""#buildcontainer"").append(el).masonry( 'reload' );
              $(""#loadmorebuilds-div"").stop().fadeOut();
           }
        });
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>And then the query for loading more:</p>

<pre><code>$query = ""SELECT * FROM blogs WHERE frontpage = 1 LIMIT 8, 1"";
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction? Hope i have explained it enough.</p>

I am trying to write a pretty simple JavaScript application but I am having some issues. I want to duplicate a sort of class structure in JavaScript the issue I am having has to do with the scope of functions inside of functions.</p>

<p>I want to create a structure like this</p>

<pre><code>function codeArray() {
    function create() {
        addElement( prop1, prop2,) {
            //create an element
        }

        function traverse(object) {
            //recursively go through some nested list data structure
            addElement(asd, 4534);
        }
    }

    function deleteElement() {
        //delete a single element from an array
    }

    print() {
        //print array;
    }
}

something.click(function() {
    codeArray.create();
    codeArray.print();
});
</code></pre>

<p>So the issue I am running into is because of the scope of the functions nested inside codeArray I cannot access them from outside codeArray. Would it be bad practice of encapsulation to just get rid of the wrapper codeArray function? Can someone suggest a better re-write for how to do this?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

Please check out the <a href=""http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/api.html"" rel=""nofollow"">latest</a> (currently v3) documentation, it is pretty straightforward</p>

<p>There are loads of threads about this issue, and I think I understand the problem, however, at the moment I cannot test with real purchases, since I don't currently have a valid credit card, what Google accepts, only a Maestro, which is not accepted. This is why I ask for help (not purchase verification, but verifying that my thought process is good).</p>

<p>First, the problem comes from the new <code>verifyPurchase</code> method. The new method checks for signatures, which should be fine. However, Google does not provide any signature for test ids, such as <code>android.test.purchased</code>. This causes the method below to always fail, and it will always return false on the verification, even if the fake purchase has been completed, and I had a confirmation dialog, that the purchase is indeed succesful. The method:</p>

<pre><code>public static boolean verifyPurchase(String base64PublicKey, String signedData, String signature) {
    //if(BuildConfig.DEBUG) return true;

    if (TextUtils.isEmpty(signedData) || TextUtils.isEmpty(base64PublicKey) ||
            TextUtils.isEmpty(signature)) {
        Log.e(TAG, ""Purchase verification failed: missing data."");
        return false;
    }

    PublicKey key = Security.generatePublicKey(base64PublicKey);
    return Security.verify(key, signedData, signature);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem comes from the <code>TextUtils.isEmpty()</code> checks, since the signature will be empty, the code will return false. My temporary, testing workaround is in the code, commented out. If I add the <code>if(BuildConfig.DEBUG) return true;</code> at the beginning of the method for testing, everything is working fine, the user gets the premium features up and running, so the problem is indeed about signatures.</p>

<p>Another problem is, if I purchase <code>android.test.purchased</code>, I cannot query the inventory of the user, so I cannot be sure, that my checker method, which checks if the user has purchased the premium feature, works.</p>

<p>My two questions:</p>

<p>If I remove the <code>if(BuildConfig.DEBUG) return true;</code> line from <code>verifyPurchase</code>, and replace the <code>android.test.purchased</code> id with the real id of the real SKU I am offering, can I be sure everything will work correctly in my case? I repeat, with the added debug functionality everything is working fine. If you need to see any more code, let me know!</p>

<p>The method below checks if the user has purchased the premium feature, if he/she has, then it sets the corresponding preferences, otherwise, if anything goes south, it leaves everything as it is. Is this method correct? I am doing this in the <code>Application</code> class, on every app start up, to prevent tinkering.</p>

<p>My update query is currently dynamic which looks something like this</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX)
DECLARE @ID INT

SET @ID = 1

Set @SQL = 'Update SERVER01.MyDatbase.dbo.MyTable
            set ModifiedDate = GetDate(), SomeOtherValue = ''xyz''
            Where Id = ' Convert(varchar(10), @ID)
</code></pre>

<p>If I now call </p>

<pre><code>EXEC(@SQL) 
</code></pre>

<p>it will sometimes work, but other times it will just hang there for ages and when I run <code>sp_active</code> I see <code>PREEMPTIVE_OLEDBOPS</code>.</p>

<p>So, I then tried using open query as follows</p>

<pre><code>Select * 
From OpenQuery(SERVER01,
               'Update SERVER01.MyDatbase.dbo.MyTable
                set ModifiedDate = GetDate(), SomeOtherValue = ''xyz''
                Where Id = 1')
</code></pre>

<p>but I get this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The OLE DB provider ""SQLNCLI11"" for linked server ""SERVER01"" indicates that either the object has no columns or the current user does not have permissions on that object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I run the following select query I successfully return the row I'm trying to update:</p>

<pre><code>Select * 
From OpenQuery(SERVER01,
               'Select *
                From SERVER01.MyDatbase.dbo.MyTable
                Where Id = 1')
</code></pre>

<p>I know that the user that is running the query has permissions, but I really don't know where to go from here. I read somewhere this error has something to do with the update query not returning a row. Is there any truth to this?</p>

<p>How can I resolve this?</p>

<p>Since POSIX time is stored as number of elapsed seconds since 1 Jan 1970, I guess that I could do this by excluding from my vector all elements which are not multiple of 3600. I rather not use this approach though. Thank you in advance, I'm new to <code>R</code>. </p>

<p>The first action is this:</p>

<pre><code>if($this-&gt;id == ""survey"") { // Esta condicición es por si se trata de mail, sms, qr o tpe (queda pendiente el callback) ?&gt;
        x$(""input#surveysubmit"").click(function() {
            var data = serialize(document.getElementById(""token-form"")); 
            if(!checkRequiredBeforeSubmit(data)) return;
            x$().xhr('&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;createUrl('survey/index', array('id'=&gt;$model-&gt;skey)); ?&gt;', {
                method: 'POST',
                async: true,
                data: urlstringserialize(serialize(document.getElementById(""token-form""))),
                callback: function() {respOK(this.responseText);}
            });
        });

<p>As you could see this is calling survey/index. Index is a controller action that finally redirects to Token/Fill that does this:</p>

<pre><code>public function actionFill($id, $agent = '') {
    $model = $this-&gt;loadModel($id);

    if(Yii::app()-&gt;request-&gt;isPostRequest) {
        // Ñapa-parche para seleccionables
        $index = 0;
        foreach($_POST as $key=&gt;$value) {
            if(preg_match('/^'.$key.'/', $value)) {
                $_POST[$value] = 1;
                $BAD = array($key, $value);
                $_POST = array_diff($_POST, $BAD);
                $index++;
            }
        }

        $requiredok = $this-&gt;controlRequiredValues($model, $model-&gt;transformSurveyRawData($_POST));
        if ($requiredok == '') {
            $isok = $model-&gt;createAnswersForToken($model-&gt;transformSurveyRawData($_POST));
            if ($isok) {
                $this-&gt;redirect(array('view', 'id' =&gt; $model-&gt;id));

<p>Everything works fine if the A interface does not include ""bad properties"" (and of course they do not appear in the AImpl class). If it does than the collection's element does not deserialize and stops after deserializing first property of interface B.</p>

If you try and do this directly, EF stores it as two columns, FIELDNAME_Address and FIELDNAME_Scope.  Unfortunately, this is insufficient for storing IPv4 addresses, as accessing ScopeId throws an exception (see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/10631615/163495"">C# The attempted operation is not supported for the type of object referenced</a>).</p>

<p>What I'd like to be able to do is define how a type gets mapped in EF, but I'm not sure how to do that, or what the terminology for it is.  This would be the cleanest solution and allow my POCO to remain pure:</p>

<pre><code>public class TestRecord 
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public IPAddress IP { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>With something in the OnModelCreating to describe how to serialize + unserialize an IPAddress object.</p>

<p>Another option I've considered is using a wrapper field:</p>

<pre><code>public class TestRecord 
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public long value_ip { get; set; }
    [NotMapped]
    public IPAddress IP 
    { 
        get { return value_ip.ToIPAddress(); }
        set { value_ip = value.ToLong(); 
    } 
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this either requires the field to be public, or some fiddling with expressions in order to map the private field.  Either way, it's not as clean as being able to define at the Context level ""this is how you store an IPAddress type"", which is my preferred solution.</p>

"18321869","1","","","2013-08-19 19:45:10","","4","326","<p>I am trying to liven my background image a little using CSS 3D transformations, the idea was to take the proverbial ""landing page full screen background image with a laptop that has a screenshot (in a coffee shop)"" and make it more dynamic: Instead of just a screenshot, put an iframe with an actual live HTML page, and make it fit exactly to the photographed item in the background image (e.g. the laptop screen). </p>

<p><strong>This has 2 challenges:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>ability to calculate the location of points in the background image solely based on the screen size</li>
<li>ability to do a 3D rotation that will match the laptop screen in the background image</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/yRkH7m.jpg"" alt=""Background Image Screenshot""></p>

<p><strong>This is how the background defined:</strong></p>

<pre><code>.splash {
  text-align: center;
  background-position: 50% 20%;
  background-size: cover;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  background-image: url(/assets/themes/twitter/bootstrap/img/scala_tutorials_screenshot2.jpg);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Background image size is: 1280 X 850</strong></p>

<p>I've managed to somehow overcome some of these requirements but in a very brute force way, </p>

<ul>
<li>left position in fixed % worked, probably due to the fact that it's width is larger than it's height </li>
<li>top position was the hardest: I measured the distance from top of the laptop screen to the top edge of the browser window (it's absolute ""top"" value) and recorded the screen width and height. and came with a 2 variables formula (using excel, a linear regression trend line and some basic math)</li>
</ul>

<p>Formula code: </p>

<pre><code> var w = window.innerWidth;
 var h =  window.innerHeight;
 var a = 0.0000146552*h - 0.0245612;
 var b = 0.177328 * h + 9.0294;
 console.log(""formula: "" + a + "" * w + "" + b);
 var top =  Math.round(a * w +  b);
 vidEl.style.top = top + ""px"";
 vidEl.style.height = Math.round((vidEl.offsetWidth / 1.438689132444542)) + ""px"";
</code></pre>

<p><strong>However there are multiple issues with this solution</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li>It doesn't work on all screen resolutions, the background doesn't scale the same as for some resolutions, (especially in 4:3 ratios) the background doesn't grow / shrink as the formula expects </li>
<li>It is really tedious work to do this again if let's say I have a different screenshot, the solution is really not generic </li>
<li>Even if I know the exact coordinates of the 4 points of the laptop screen in the image, I don't have a way in CSS to simply put a div over it, I had to experiment with <code>rotateX</code>, <code>rotateY</code> and <code>rotateZ</code> (and <code>perspective-origin</code>) to be able to match, and the match is not exact </li>
<li>Due to some perspective-origin quirks, I need to compensate the larger the screen is which leads to some ugly code like this:</li>
</ol>

<p>Tweaking hacks (yes, I know it's ugly, and probably can reduce it / merge with the above formula somehow)</p>

<pre><code>   if(w &gt;= 1200) {
      if(w &lt; 1400) {
        element.style.top = ""-10px"";
      } else if (w &lt; 1600) {
        element.style.top = ""-13px"";
      } else if (w &lt; 1700) {
        element.style.top = ""-15px"";
      } else if (w &lt; 1800) {
        element.style.top = ""-17px"";
      } else {
        element.style.top = ""-19px"";
      } 
    } else {
      element.className = """";
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> 
You can see what I have made so far <a href=""http://scalatutorials.com"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> <em>requires screen width above 1200 pixels</em> </p>

<p><strong>The question:</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there a way to have a generic formula, that for any given original location in the background image (e.g. the 4 points of the screen corners), given the background image original size, <code>background-position</code> definition, screen width and height to find the new coordinates that match the background image? </p></li>
<li><p>I'd like instead of doing guesswork on <code>rotateX</code>, Y and Z, to be able to automatically calculate the X, Y and Z rotation values, that will rotate a DIV to cover exactly a given set of 4 2D coordinates (e.g. the laptop screen)</p></li>

<p>I have a custom grid (mostly from Infragistics) and it has three columns ""ColA, ColB, ColC"". ColB and ColC have comboboxes. ColB and ColC already are bind to a datasource.

Here I need to change some logic in the collection refinement for ColC based on the ColB selected value. But I am not able to as I am not sure where the refinement is taking place. I tried placing the breakpoints, but there is no event triggering while changing the value in ColB and thus I dont know the codes related to refinement.</p>

    CopyData.lpData := PWideChar(Msg);
    CopyData.cbData := (1 + Length(Msg))*SizeOf(WideChar);
    Winapi.Windows.SendMessage(hMouse, WM_COPYDATA, 0, LPARAM(@CopyData));

<p>I changed it to this, which prints out the parameters only if the function does not equal <code>4</code> (implemented without a decorator param):</p>

<pre><code>def get_all_func_param_name_values(func, *func_args, **func_kwargs):

    params = list(zip(arg_names, args))

<p>(I don't understand why the <code>1</code> is printed in the second line.)</p>

<p>I then changed it to pass in the expected value, <code>4</code>, as decorator parameter. As described in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/10176276/2736496"">this answer</a>, it requires that the original decorator be a nested function:</p>

<p>(Again, that <code>1</code>...)</p>

<p>I'm not clear on how to change this hard-coded <code>4</code> to an <code>expected_value</code> parameter, that is passed through at every function call. All the examples I've seen (like <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10176226/how-to-pass-extra-arguments-to-python-decorator"">this one</a>) have hard-coded parameters.</p>

<p>I currently experimenting with </p>

<pre><code>assert_expected_func_params(4, getA, 1)
assert_expected_func_params(4, getA, 1, 3)
assert_expected_func_params(4, getA, 4, d = 5)
assert_expected_func_params(4, getA, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, d = 6, g = 12.9)
</code></pre>

<p>But it's far from working.</p>

<p>How do I implement a decorator parameter that I can pass in to <em>every function call</em>? </p>

<p>In my application I am using PHP/Apache as a backend and <a href=""http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ben Alman's jQuery BBQ plugin</a> for hashtag browser history. User logins are handled solely by the PHP server end using POST from a login page and state maintained using server side sessions. The problem I have is that if a user visits a URL with a fragment (hash) and they are not logged in they are redirected to the HTTPS login page. This works well in every situation except where the URL contains fragment hash. The same situation would be the case for any redirect initiated from the server side. It's not like javascript can be used in this situation to preserve the hashtag before the redirect as page load never completes before the redirect.</p>

<p>I realise that the fragments will be lost during the redirect (as it's client side only) and is never seen by the server end but how does everyone else handle this situation and preserve the URL originally visited so that the user can end up on the correct page after login or redirect? </p>

<p>Any advice appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>If you own the book, it's in Chapter 3's, ""Classes, Objects, and Variables,"" specifically in the section about virtual attributes.</p>

<p>Basically, a class is defined with an initializer that sets a couple of instance variables, one of which is <code>@price</code>. That variable has an accessor / mutator created with attr_accessor like so:</p>

<pre><code>attr_accessor :price
</code></pre>

<p>That class also has a virtual attribute called, <code>price_in_cents</code> which simply returns the value from this line:</p>

<pre><code>Integer(price*100 + 0.5)
</code></pre>

<p>Now my question is why is <code>price</code> in the virtual attribute not prefixed with an <code>@</code>? It is clearly dealing with an instance variable. Executing the code without the <code>@</code> works just the same as with; why is that?</p>

<p>P.S. Sorry for not just posting the code wholesale—given that this is a question about code in a book, I wasn't sure what legal right I'd have to post.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the current code coverage is 20% (a legacy application) and as new unit tests are written, code coverage improves to 25%.

<p>My issues are twofold:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How to point the context to a regular SQL instance instead of the LocalDb.  At the very least LocalDb is not viable for me since my hosting provider does not support it.</p></li>
<li><p>How to use a custom database for my identity entities.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I realize I could just change the connection string for the ""DefaultConnection"" entry in the Web.Config.  But that still leaves me a series of tables prefixed with ""AspNet"" or some such.</p>

<p>Under the old MembershipProvider architecture, you could inherit from the providers and implement everything you needed in any way you want by placing entries in the Web.config that pointed the Forms Authentication process to your custom membership process.</p>

<p>With the new identity process, however, there are no hooks in the web.config to use.  Additionally, inheriting from it is not any good as nothing appears to be virtual and to top it all off, it is inheriting from an existing context to boot.  </p>

<p>I tried using my own context with entities implementing the appropriate new interfaces, but all it did was ignore my context completely and not only that, use localdb with a default DefaultConnection Connection String, ignoring my own context.</p>

<p>Since this is a new Microsoft brainchild, there are no real walkthroughs on how to customize the new process, just demos on how great the new process is.  </p>

<p>I came across one entry out in the web that mentioned rolling out your own identity process and connect it to the OWIN process, but I am totally unfamiliar with OWIN and would need at least some info on how this could be done.

<p>Now I want to read and write settings on the robot via the ground station. Therefore I thought about implementing a ""virtual register"" on the robot that can be manipulated by the ground station.</p>

<p>It could be made up of structs and look like this:</p>

<pre><code>// accelerometer register
struct accel_reg {
  // accelerations
  int32_t accelX;
  int32_t accelY;
  int32_t accelZ;
};

// infrared distance sensor register 
struct ir_reg {
  uint16_t  dist; // distance
};

// robot's register table
struct {
  uint8_t     status;         // current state
  uint32_t    faultFlags;     // some fault flags
  accel_reg   accelerometer;  // accelerometer register
  ir_reg      ir_sensors[4];  // 4 IR sensors connected
} robot;

// usage example:

robot.accelerometer.accelX = -981;
robot.ir_sensors[1].dist = 1024;
</code></pre>

<p>On the robot the registers will be constantly filled with new values and configuration settings are set by the ground station and applied by the robot.</p>

<p>The ground station and the robot will be written in C++ so they both can use the same struct datatype.</p>

<p><strong>The question</strong> I have now is how to encapsulate the read/write operations in a protocol without writing tons of meta data? </p>

<p>Let's say I want to read the register <code>robot.ir_sensors[2].dist</code>. How would I address this register in my protocol?</p>

<p>I already thought about transmitting a relative offset in bytes (i.e the relative position in memory inside the struct) but I think memory alignment and padding may cause problems, especially because the ground station runs on a x86_64 architecture and the robot runs on a 32-bit ARM processor.</p>

<p>Thanks for any hints! :)</p>

<p>The API I'm using for building stacks in rapidweaver doesn't allow for division or floats, but I essentially want to divide a number by another number.</p>

<h2>The relevant rules of the API:</h2>

<p>The API is placed inside html, css, and javascript files and is compiled into actual html, css, and javascript before generating the project files.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In this API each mathematical operation is wrapped in:</p>

<p><code>%( math )%</code></p></li>
<li><p>So to achieve (1 + 3) * 6 it'd be:</p>

<p><code>%( %( 1 + 3 )% * 6 )%</code></p>

<p>Using <code>%( 1 + 3 * 6 )%</code> would break it, only one operation is allowed inside each <code>%()%</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, I can use variables which will represent user input</p>

<p><code>%id=variableName%</code></p></li>
<li><p>So, if I want to multiply user input by 2 I can do:</p>

<p><code>%( %id=variableName% * 2 )%</code></p></li>
</ol>

<h2>What I want to do:</h2>

<p><code>%( %id=CB_seconds% / 2 )%</code> OR <code>%( %id=CB_seconds% * 0.5 )%</code></p>

<p>But ^these^ are not allowed for some stupid reason...</p>

<p>I want to take the user input <code>%id=CB_seconds%</code>, and divide it in half. The user will define <code>%id=CB_seconds%</code> as an integer between 0 and 10,000. I need both the original value and the divided value in different areas. One possible solution is to have the user specify a value between 0 and 5,000 and multiply this value by two. However, this wont work because the user is defining the length of an animation and it's confusing to ask them to specify half the length they really want.</p>

<h2>My Question</h2>

<p>Is there some way to get half of a number using ONLY integers and multiplication/addition/subtraction, and without knowing what the number will be before hand?</p>

The problem that I've encountered is that various implementations of low pass filters seem not to work with my echo implementation. At the begining of the filtering I have an array of bytes (read) that is read from the capturing buffer. The values of this array are between 0 and 255.</p>

<p>When I subject the array to low-pass filtering algorithm I obtain values that fall between 0 and 1 and as an effect the play array is silent (zeros only). I attach the relevant code.</p>

<pre><code>struct no_type{};

<p>Now it seems to me that result should be true if T offers a non-static member function ""apply"" that accepts a double rvalue and a template parameter literal, and false otherwise. However, the example given actually fails to compile for class B, when compiling <code>has_apply&lt;B&gt;</code>. Shouldn't the fact that the substitution of T failed in the decltype statement mean that it simply calls the other func? Isn't that kind of the point of SFINAE?</p>

<p>Solved in the most ridiculous, pointless fashion ever:</p>

<pre><code>struct no_type{};
template&lt;typename T&gt; struct has_apply {
    template&lt;typename U&gt; static decltype(U().apply&lt;0u&gt;(double())) func( U* );

    static const bool result = !std::is_same&lt;no_type, decltype(func&lt;T&gt;(nullptr))&gt;::value;

I have been using non parameterized queries which makes my project extremely vulnerable to SQL injection</p>

<p><strong>Plot:</strong></p>

<p>I have a form where you enter a date.
PHP will get the date and use it in a query to retrieve multiple rows of information.</p>

<p>How do I parametize my mysqli queries and print out the multiple rows? This is what I have so far:</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""#"" class=""form-horizontal"" method=""post""&gt;
    &lt;label for=""fromDate"" class=""control-label""&gt;Date from:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type=""date"" id=""fromDate"" class=""datepicker"" name=""searchDate"" value=""&lt;?php echo $searchDate; ?&gt;""&gt;
    &lt;button type=""submit"" class=""btn""&gt;Go&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""formIdentifier"" value=""mainSearch"" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>PHP</strong></p>

<pre><code>if($_POST['formIdentifier'] == ""mainSearch""){
    //get date from form
    $searchDate = $_POST['searchDate'];
    $todayDateFrom = $searchDate."" 00:00:00"";
    $todayDateTo = $searchDate."" 23:59:59"";
    $stmt = $conn-&gt;prepare(""SELECT G.* FROM Groups AS G, Customers AS C 
            WHERE C.travel_Date &gt;= '?'
            AND   C.travel_Date &lt;= '?'
            AND C.customer_ID = G.leader_ID"");
    $stmt-&gt;bind_param(""si"", todayDateFrom , todayDateTo );
    $stmt-&gt;execute();
    /* bind variables to prepared statement */
    $stmt-&gt;bind_result($col1, $col2);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>PHP loop</strong></p>

<pre><code>while ($stmt-&gt;fetch()) {
    //Display copious amounts of data.
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have based my code from the PHP manual and ended up getting overwhelmed. I'm not even sure if I'm on the right track in preparing my queries let alone attempting how to display the data. Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>note - if someone could explain <code>$stmt-&gt;bind_param(""si"", todayDateFrom , todayDateTo );</code> specifically the ""si"" that would be fantastic. I just don't understand what its purpose is.</p>

<p><strong>--SOLUTION--</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to all the answers I was able to get my first parameterized query to work.</p>

<p>As suggested, I removed the "" ' "" that was surrounding "" ? "" in my query.</p>

<p>I then changed the <code>bind_param</code> ""si"" to ""ss"" because i was binding 2 strings, not a string and an integer.</p>

<p>I then binded the results (in this example I have 3 columns in the table)</p>

<pre><code>$stmt-&gt;bind_result($group_ID, $leader_ID, $gDate);
</code></pre>

<p>Because I don't currently have a 3rd party driver installed, I had to display the results like so:</p>

<pre><code>while ($stmt-&gt;fetch()) {
    echo ""group_ID: "".$group_ID.""&lt;br /&gt;"";
    echo ""leader_ID: "".$leader_ID.""&lt;br /&gt;"";
    echo ""group_Date: "".$group_Date.""&lt;br /&gt;"";
}

I have used a rather dangerous approach to use two FileStreams, where </p>

<ol>
<li>FileStream 1 is reading from the file and copying it to a byte array</li>
<li>The contents of the byte array is encrypted.</li>
<li>FileStream 2, writes the bytes back to the same file.</li>
</ol>

<p>This works fine but has a great chance of messing up a file if the encryption stops halfway etc.</p>

<p>So the normal approach is to write to a temp file, and then move it to the original location and replacing the original file. </p>

<p>However the problem is in mobile phones where resources (especially storage) are very limited, creating lets say another 200MB or 300MB file maybe impossible. </p>

<p>So what approaches are there to handle this problem in Mobile Devies? Do I have to gamble between space and messing up the file?</p>

<p>Can someone just give me an alternate way to do this. I have three fields and would like to base my boost(s) on those three fields. </p>

<p>Lets say there is a field with boolean values ( either 1 or 0 ), I want to boost results that take value 1. Is there a way to do this? we'll have to write an ""if"" condition of some sort am I right? simply, is there a way to get it done?</p>

<p>The carousel program I am using doesn't allow for captions so I used the following CSS to add them so we have live text rather than adding text to the image:</p>

<pre><code>/* Carousel */
.ult-carousel-wrapper {
  margin-bottom: 35px;
  position: relative;
}

.ult-item-wrap{padding-bottom:95px; }
.ult-item-wrap a{font-size:28px; color:#B0964D; font-family: 'Alex Brush', cursive;  word-wrap: break-word;}
.ult-item-wrap a:hover{color:#333;}
.ult-item-wrap img{margin-bottom:15px;}
.sculpt-rest a::after{ content: ""Sculpture Restoration"";}
.sculpt-comm  a::after{ content: ""Sculpture Commissions"";}
.consultation a::after{ content: ""Consultation Fees""; }
.artists a::after{ content: ""Meet the Artists"";}
.new-directions a::after{ content: ""New Directions"";}
.awards a::after{ content: ""Custom Awards"";}
.paint-rest a::after{ content: ""Painting Restoration"";}

@media only screen and ( max-width:1280px ) {
.ult-item-wrap a{font-size:13px; font-family:Helvetica;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem that I am having is that as the screen size gets smaller the words overlap rather than going to a line below. </p>

<p>Does anyone know how to make them go to the line below rather than overlap?</p>

in <code>MyView.xaml</code> (which is automatically attached to <code>MyViewModel</code> by <code>cm</code>) I have simple <code>xcdg:DataGridControl</code> nested inside <code>Window</code> control.</p>

<p>My problem is that the style defined this way doesn't have any effect for the first time, but it's working properly when I close and reopen window or open any other, similar window.</p>

<p>This problem doesn't occur when I define this style directly inside <code>xcdg:DataGridControl.Resources</code> but I have several windows and I would like not to repeat myself.</p>

<p>From my observations the same thing goes for any style defined this way and is not correlated with this specific control.</p>

I am trying to cut this down substantially, and the source of the allocations is not obvious.</p>

<p>To instrument things I have recorded my ETW traces for the CLR / GC, and have exported the AllocationTick event, which records every time an additional 100 kilobytes is allocated, and what the object type was that was most recently allocated. This produces a nice size sample set. Three object types account for 70% of my allocations, but they are a bit of a mystery.</p>

<ol>
<li>System.Int64 <strong>30%</strong></li>
<li>System.Int32 <strong>28%</strong></li>
<li>System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallSite'1[System.Func'3[System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallSite,System.Object,System.Object]] <strong>12%</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The dataset was ~70 minutes and a million events, so I am quite confident in the numbers.</p>

<p>I am guessing this is somehow indicating that I am creating a lot of pointers on the heap in some unexpected way? (this is an x64 application)</p>

<p>I use some linq and foreach loops, but these should only be creating increment variables on the stack, not the heap.</p>

<p>I am running everything on top of the TPL / Dataflow library as well, which could be generating these.</p>

<p>I am looking for any advice on what may be causing so many heap allocations of int32/64, and perhaps some techniques to isolate these allocations (call stacks would be great, but may be performance prohibitive).</p>

<p><strong>am i using the repository pattern in the correct manner?</strong></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>can anyone provide a better solution for my example beneath?</strong></p>

<p>Here is an example (i'm using poco) where i have fetched a location with lazyloading turned off earlier in the process. After some ui interaction i want to update the location properties (eg. name) and the related users (including add and remove):</p>

<pre><code>
using (var repo = RepositoryHelper.GetLocationRepository())
using (var repo2 = RepositoryHelper.GetUserRepository(repo.UnitOfWork))
{
    repo.Add(location);
    repo.UnitOfWork.Context.ObjectStateManager.ChangeObjectState(location, EntityState.Modified);

    foreach (var user in location.Users)
    {
        repo2.Add(user);
        if (user.Id != 0)
        {
            repo2.UnitOfWork.Context.ObjectStateManager.ChangeObjectState(user, EntityState.Unchanged);
        }
    }

    foreach (var user in _remove.Where(user => user.Id != 0))
    {
        repo2.Delete(user);
    }

    repo2.UnitOfWork.Commit();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The example is working, although i'm very confused about how to the the Attach command. I thought it is used if the object comes from another context?! But if i try that, i always get an exception, that the object is in use by another context. And lets say, i'm detaching the location, i cannot access the Users collection right after that. </p>

<p>Another question (and i think it's closly related to this): i've always read, that the database connection should be as short as possible. Therefor i added the IDisposable interface to the repositories, so i can use them in the same way as an ObjectContext. However i found some examples (i think also in the wpf application framework), where this is not the usual approach. So, what words should i follow?</p>

<p>Kind Regards,</p>

<p>My logging shows that the database connection (ODBC using the SQL Server driver) will be working fine (read and update database) then after an exception throws (and is caught/logged but no real detail) the connection can read data from the database but can no longer update the database.</p>

<p>So I see a thread is reading the next row to process, sending data out a socket to another server, tries to update the record as processed and BOOM.</p>

<p>This code processes tens of thousands of records, may run for months and shortly after this thread (always seems to be the first victim, may just be the busiest and gets whacked first) starts choking all the other connections appear to have the same problem - read is allowed but updates throw this exception.</p>

<p>I got a quick look at the task manager the last time (it gets bounced quick so I can't examine for long) and the app was using the typical 5 to 6 Meg of RAM and the other resources looked normal.  </p>

<p>My question is how do you set this parameter via POM or other means with Maven to achieve same behaviour with genrated sources? My stackoverflow and google searches aren't revealing much. There's a Jira issue, which seems to be closed by developers without pointing in right direction.</p>

"29209705","1","","","2015-03-23 12:02:13","","0","36","<p>So here's the thing. I recently updated a web project to use nuget for its dependencies, which in turn updated all of those dependencies to the latest versions.</p>

<p>Quite a task as there were some breaking changes, but I have the thing running locally perfectly.</p>

<p>We use TeamCity to pull the solution from bitbucket and deploy it the the local iis folder on a development (staging) server.</p>

<p>After a build, the website seems very poorly, first off it complains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could not load file or assembly
  'file:///C:\web\Dev.Pegfect.Presentation\bin\mscorlib.dll' or one of
  its dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an
  incorrect format.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is strange since my local copy does not have a copy of mscorlib in its web bin folder. Should be using the GAC? If I remove the dll, I get a new error (some NHibernate issue complaining about reflection). I haven't pursued that since it all seems environmental.</p>

<p>If I copy my local bin folder over the server web bin, it starts to run ok albeit extremely slowly (relative to how it used to).</p>

<p>So, the question ""what have you tried"" - i am currently installing VS 2012 onto the server and will try building the project from source directly. I am also considering updating TeamCity from v7 to v9.</p>

<p>I could also try to reinstall IIS8.0 on the server.</p>

<p>These are desperate, blind shots in the dark. What would you try?</p>

<p>FWIW the project is targeting .NET 4.5.1 (ANY CPU)</p>

For example, say a column is added to a table that I am querying, even if that column is inconsequential to the query it will fail. Is there any way to get Linq to Entities to handle minor database variances more gracefully? That is, ignoring any variance that does not affect the query?</p>

<p>Some context here, I'm using Linq to Entities to work a with a database for a legacy product of ours.

<p>But there can be only one such association per component.
No two different softwares can be associated to the same package if they have the same parent component.</p>

I believe the trouble is to do with my lack of understanding of how C++ handles variables.</p>

<p>I've slurped a file's contents into an array successfully and I can act on each complete line (e.g. search/replace text). I also found some great examples of how to parse strings. The problem occurs when I try to apply the parse examples to the strings in my array.</p>

<p>The strings are created via:</p>

<pre><code>    std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; File_Lines;
    ifstream file(filename.c_str());
    while ( file.good() ) {
      getline ( file, line, '\n' );
      string InputLine = string( line );
      File_Lines.push_back(line);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>One working example of parsing strings (that I found on this site) is:</p>

<pre><code>char myString[] = ""The quick brown fox"";
char *p = strtok(myString, "" "");
while (p) {
  printf (""Token: %s\n"", p);
  p = strtok(NULL, "" "");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem starts when I try to feed my string to the code that does the parsing. Feeding it directly:</p>

<pre><code>char myString[] = File_Lines[array_counter];
</code></pre>

<p>gives ""error: initializer fails to determine size of ‘myString’""</p>

<p>If I try converting using ""std::string"" (as suggested in other answers on this site):</p>

<pre><code>std::string File_Line;
File_Line = File_Lines[array_counter];
char myString[] = File_Line;
</code></pre>

<p>...I get the same error.</p>

<p>Other answers suggested adjusting the code to:</p>

<pre><code>char *myString = File_Line;
</code></pre>

<p>but that just gives me ""error: cannot convert ‘std::string {aka std::basic_string}’ to ‘char*’ in initialization""</p>

<p>I'm aware that the problem is due to my own ignorance, but I'd really appreciate any help on how to feed a string into a parser. </p>

<p>Also, if anyone has any simple explanation of how to convert between the data types, that would be great.</p>

<p>As far I know Adobe Connect Pro is using some external library that do AEC. I'd like to follow this direction and do something similiar.</p>

<p>There comes two possibilities in my mind:</p>

<p>1) Independend custom AEC filter.</p>

<p>The custom AEC filter will be run in the background and will be processing all data from microphone and sound card and doing AEC. The echo signal will be the data that is to be played but delayed in a temporary buffer,  something like this: aec(input, delayed_input, output).</p>

<p>I don't know if it work, because Flash microphone input doesn't know about my custom input and the same with the speakers. But how it is done in WinXP/Vista that have AEC at the system level?</p>

<p>2) AEC filter interacting with Flex's NativeProcess.</p>

<p>The filter will be run by NativeProcess. Flex app will pass microphone sound, received remote voice to the filter and return voice with echo removed and then Flex will output this to the speakers. Will it be correct?</p>

<p>If the 2) method is OK then I have following questions: </p>

<ol>
<li>I will start with Speex's AEC so in what format should be the data pased from Flex? If I choose Flex Speex codec for sound compression can I pass it directly to the speex library?</li>
<li>Will be the performance OK? Calling NativeProcess library every sound frame buffer can be time consuming I think.</li>
<li>Why there is no AEC implementation in AS3 that can be used directly from Flash? As far I know to do AEC you must have echo data and microphone data (in Flash 10 there is direct access to the microphone). There is definetly something that is stopping doing it like this but I don't know what it is yet :)</li>
<li>Is there some free AEC implementation or a DSP library with in except Speex's that I can use?</li>

When the request is complete, a success or error message is displayed. During development however, I sometimes have PHP errors which end up being returned instead of the JSON. When this happens, I just get the error message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The code I have now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var request = $.post(url, data, null, ""json"");
request.fail(on_failure);
var on_failure = function(jqXHR, text_status, error_thrown)
{
    $(""#text_status"").empty().append(error_thrown);
};
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to be able to show the PHP error if one is returned rather than just indicate that there is a PHP error (just to speed up debugging). Obviously, if a non-JSON parsing error such as HTTP 404 occurs, I still want to display that. I found a method <a href=""http://www.unseenrevolution.com/jquery-ajax-error-handling-function/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> that indicates that I can detect this error with something like this</p>

<pre><code>$.ajaxSetup({
    error: function(jqXHR, exception) {
        if (exception === 'parsererror') {
            alert('Requested JSON parse failed.');
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn't seem like that helps me because it runs for every request rather than individual requests and (as far as I know) it does not allow access to the error message in the returned data.</p>

Since this is a SQL Azure Database and will be fairly large I am concerned about the cost of a growing database due to auditing.</p>

<p>In order to cut down on the costs needed for auditing purposes, I am considering storing the audit table (or tables) in Azure Tables instead of Azure SQL Databases.  So the question becomes, how to get the SQL Server trigger to get the changed data into Azure Tables?</p>

<p>The only thing I can come up with is to have an audit table (or tables) in SQL Databases so the trigger can insert the rows locally, and then have a Worker Role every X seconds pull any rows from that and move them to Azure Tables and delete from the SQL Database table so it doesn't grow large.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do this integration?  Can I somehow put a message in a queue from a trigger?</p>

<p>Say I've got a simple C/C++ application like so:</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    int h = open(""something"");

    while (true)

<p>In Windows, I'd use something like <code>GetAsyncKeyState()</code> (or some other sort of keyboard checking functionality) to look for say the escape key, and break out of my loop when it was pressed. That way my <code>close(h)</code> would get called, and I'd do all the cleanup I need to.</p>

<p>The way I've been terminating my applications in Linux has been using <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, which from my reading means it sends <code>SIGINT</code>, and is a 'friendly' way to cause an application to quit. However, in my experience, that's just caused it to sorta drop everything and close wherever it was when it got that signal (meaning my post-loop cleanup never runs.)</p>

<p>Some have suggested I use <code>signal()</code> to listen for <code>SIGINT</code>, but others disagree with that method. (Plus, it tends to create a bit more differences between how things are done between Windows and Linux, and I'd like to stay as close as possible to running on both platforms.)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there a serious processing
overhead if I were to include these
items in EVERY page (like in the
Site.Master for example) thus
negating the need for the HtmlHelper
to organise the ""includes"" -
considering there would end up being
about 20 includes for all the
different types of jQuery UI widgets
used throughout the site.</p></li>
<li><p>If the HtmlHelper sorts out the
    ""includes"", it will add one every
    time this DatePicker is used (often
    there are two on a page) Does anyone
    have a way of determining whether or
    not the user has already rendered
    the same type of control on the
    page, thus not re-including the same
    jquery libraries when multiple
    instances of the DatePicker (for
    example) are used?</p></li>

<p>I can't figure out how to get access to</p>

<p>1) The root list box
2) The TextBox control within an item given a list box item ID</p>

<p>Here's what I tried. When this runs, the <code>MainLongListSelector.SelectedITem = nextItem</code> causes the next item to be selected, but it does NOT get focus.</p>

<pre><code>private void TextBox_TextChanged(object sender, TextChangedEventArgs e) {
    var editBox = sender as TextBox;
    var selectedItem = MainLongListSelector.SelectedItem as ItemViewModel;
    if (editBox != null &amp;&amp; selectedItem != null &amp;&amp; editBox.Text.Length &gt; 138) {
        // Move data at end to next box
        var overflow = editBox.Text.Substring(138, editBox.Text.Length - 138) ;
        selectedItem.Tweet = editBox.Text.Substring(0, 138);
        var nextItem = App.ViewModel.Items[int.Parse(selectedItem.ID) + 1];
        nextItem.Tweet = overflow;
        MainLongListSelector.SelectedItem = nextItem;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to be able to access the actual TextBox of that <code>nextItem</code> so I can explicitly set focus to it.</p>

<p>The same question applies if I just use <code>ListBox</code> but the issues are different. In the <code>ListBox</code> case when the <code>DataTemplate</code> contains a <code>TextBox</code> and focus is set, I don't get <code>SelectionChanged</code> events...which is why I'm sticking with <code>LongListSelector</code>.</p>

<p>I noticed yesterday that the majority of my bundle files no longer have the v query string parameter to the exception of one of them:</p>

<p>/Sgc.Web/bundles/css/JQueryUI</p>

<p>/Sgc.Web/bundles/css/DefaultPage</p>

<p>/Sgc.Web/bundles/js/Menu</p>

<p>/Sgc.Web/bundles/js/DefaultPage</p>

<p>/Sgc.Web/bundles/js/ReportOutputs</p>

<p>/Sgc.Web/bundles/js/UnderscoreBackbone?v=4YsZ6DBVserabs64GE87Ua4d51aeg0D1wXHWNe3E6NU1</p>

<p>The JS bundle that still has the query string always keeps on producing different v param values after I do changes on it (as expected). However the remaining bundles (either css or js) when I make changes on their css or js files they do incorporate those changes but do not produce a v param value any more.</p>

<p>The C# code to perform the bundling:</p>

<pre><code>// -- create and add CSS bundles without minification
  BundleTable.EnableOptimizations = true;

  bundles.Add(new Bundle(""~/bundles/css/JQueryUI"").Include(
               ""~/Styles/Gui/jquery-ui-1.10.4-custom.css"",
               ""~/Styles/Gui/jquery-ui-custom.css"",
               ""~/Styles/Gui/jquery.ui.combogrid.css""));

  bundles.Add(new Bundle(""~/bundles/css/DefaultPage"").Include(
               ""~/Styles/Default.css"",
               ""~/Content/toastr.min.css""));   

  // -- create and add JS bundles without minification
  bundles.Add(new Bundle(""~/bundles/js/DefaultPage"").Include(
                ""~/Scripts/Defaults.js"",
                ""~/Scripts/toastr.min.js""));

  bundles.Add(new Bundle(""~/bundles/js/Menu"").Include(
                ""~/Scripts/Gui/Menus/SuperFish/jquery.hoverIntent.r7.min.js"",
                ""~/Scripts/Gui/Menus/SuperFish/superfish1_7_4.min.js"",
                ""~/Scripts/Gui/Menus/SuperFish/factory.js""));

  bundles.Add(new Bundle(""~/bundles/js/UnderscoreBackbone"").Include(
                ""~/Scripts/underscore.min.js"",
                ""~/Scripts/backbone.min.js""));

  bundles.Add(new Bundle(""~/bundles/js/ReportOutputs"").Include(
                ""~/Scripts/Gui/jquery-visibility.js"",
                ""~/Scripts/UserControls/ReportOutputs.js""));

  //-- if in Release mode, then minify all the bundles
  if (!System.Web.HttpContext.Current.IsDebuggingEnabled)
  {
      CssMinify cssMinify = new CssMinify();
      JsMinify jsMinify = new JsMinify();

      foreach (Bundle bundle in bundles)
      {
          if (bundle.Path.Contains(""/js""))
          {
              bundle.Transforms.Add(jsMinify);
          }
          else
          {
              bundle.Transforms.Add(cssMinify);
          }
      }
</code></pre>

<p>As can be seen from above I'm building the bundle with the Bundle super class instead of the StyleBundle or ScriptBundle sub classes. However I also tried to make bundles with these 2 subclasses and the result was the same: all bundles still didn't had v param to the exception of the UnderscoreBackbone bundle. As far as I know there is no difference in the way the UnderscoreBackbone bundle is being made and the remaining bundles.</p>

<p>I'm using,</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 8.1</li>
<li>VS Premium 2013 with Update 1</li>
<li>Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization 1.1.3</li>

<p>Does anyone ever faced this kind of problem before or any hint as to where can I look for a solution to it ?</p>

"12608025","1","12608528","","2012-09-26 18:22:15","","9","18837","<p>I've got a rather interesting situation. I have a SQLite database full of addresses and messages (addresses are not unique; messages are). Each message also has a date associated with it. What I want to do is select <em>the first</em> message's address, message, date, and <em>how many messages</em> are associated with the address.</p>

<p>So, I thought, ""I can just GROUP by the address to only get one message per address, then ORDER these by the date, and also fetch the COUNT of the address column.""</p>

<p>I did that, and it works... kinda. It fetches the correct count, fetches only one message per address, and orders them by date--but it does not select the <em>most recent</em> message for the address. It appears to be arbitrary.</p>

<p>As an example, I have three messages (earliest to latest) A, B, C from address Y, and three messages D, E, F from address Z. The query may fetch messages B and E, <em>then</em> sort them by date. It <em>should</em> fetch messages C and F, and sort those by date.</p>

<p>Here is what I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>// Expanded version:
Cursor cursor = db.query(
    /* FROM */ ""messages_database"",
    /* SELECT */ new String[]{ ""*"", ""COUNT(address) AS count"" },
    /* WHERE */ null,
    /* WHERE args */ null,
    /* GROUP BY */ ""address"",
    /* HAVING */ null,
    /* ORDER BY */ ""date DESC""
);

// Or, same code on one line:
Cursor cursor = db.query(""messages_database"", new String[]{ ""*"", ""COUNT(address) AS count"" }, null, null, ""address"", null, ""date DESC"");
</code></pre>

<p>I feel like this may have to do with the <code>HAVING</code> clause, but I really don't know. I've used MySQL a lot with PHP, but never had to touch <code>HAVING</code> before. I tried setting my <code>HAVING</code> clause to <code>""MAX(date)""</code>, but it had no effect. If I set my <code>GROUP BY</code> clause to be <code>""address, date""</code>, then they are sorted by date, but of course they are all individual instead of grouped (since the dates differ).</p>

<p>Google searches have proved fruitless; queries like ""<em>android sqlite order before group</em>"" and ""<em>android sqlite group by order</em>"" yield no related results.</p>

<p>How can I select the <em>one latest</em> message for each address without removing my <code>GROUP</code> clause (as <code>COUNT()</code> relies upon this)? Do I need two queries?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Based on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/7745635/570191"">the answer</a> @Adrian linked me to in the comments, I came up with two queries which both produced the same result; one row, in which the count was 7 (which is the total number of addresses, not messages <em>per</em> address), and the address shown was not that of the latest message.</p>

<p>The two queries were:</p>

<pre><code>Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery(
      ""SELECT t.*, COUNT(t.message_content) AS count ""
    + ""FROM messages_database t ""
    + ""INNER JOIN (""
    + ""    SELECT address, MAX(date) AS maxdate ""
    + ""    FROM messages_database ""
    + ""    GROUP BY address ""
    + "") ss ON t.address = ss.address AND t.date = ss.maxdate"",
    null
);
Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery(
      ""SELECT t1.*, COUNT(t1.message_content) AS count ""
    + ""FROM messages_database t1 ""
    + ""LEFT OUTER JOIN messages_database t2 ""
    + ""ON (t1.address = t2.address AND t1.date &lt; t2.date) ""
    + ""WHERE t2.address IS NULL"",
    null
);

<p>I have a 'chars' table for characteristics with the columns 'id', 'descrip', and 'class'. </p>

<p>I have a 'animal' table with the columns 'animal_id', 'charlist', ...</p>

<p>In 'chars' id is an incremented int, 'descrip' and 'class' are text/strings. </p>

<p>'id' and 'descrip' are different for every row but 'class' will be the same sometimes having a value like 'habitat', 'size', 'diet', et cetra. </p>

<p>What I am going for is a list that will look like this: </p>

<ul><strong>Habitat</strong><li>underground</li><li>arctic</li></ul>

<ul><strong>Diet</strong><li>fish</li><li>insects</li><li>omnivore</li></ul>

<p>Here is where I start to have trouble. On a 'Details' page I am showing all of the data specific to a certain animal (whichever is clicked) and to reference the 'characteristics' each animal has it's own 'charlist' value in the database. This value is a string of numbers that reference the 'chars' table, like '2,55,67,90,122'. </p>

<p>So I've pulled all my (specific) animal data to a php variable on the page that I want to supply with the information. Now I need to use the 'charlist' data from that animal to lookup and list the characteristics relative to the animal.</p>

<p>My queries are looking like this, and I know I'm waaay off: </p>

<p>SELECT * FROM 'chars' LEFT INNER JOIN 'animals' ON chars.id IN (animals.charlist) WHERE ...</p>

<p>I've tried a lot of different ways and this is where I get lost. My brain is telling me to join the tables, find the numbers that are in the charlist WHERE animal.animal_id = mysql_real_escape_string($animal_id) - and of course MySQL tells me I can't do it this way. </p>

<p>I know that for the titles of the lists I'll probably have to do this with a GROUP BY condition. </p>

<p>Any help on the query and query syntax would be great. I'm fairly new to MySQL and I'm very happy and eager to learn how to do this right.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>and the following basic report beginning as follows:</p>

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
"";

*proc template code is placed in here to generate report.

<p>When I run the code directly in SAS the html code I inject with a link to the PDF works fine, but when run with the batch program, it looks like the html is not encoded correctly (shown below). The rest of the report is fine, it is just the PDF link that no longer works.</p>

<p>I am not sure how to go about making this work correctly through the batch program. Would it be better to just add the link outside of SAS, rather than inserting within the SAS program?</p>

<p><strong>Relationships</strong>

<p>Now I am trying to select all the Concerts for a particular AdminstratorUserId but also include all the Bookings for each Concert and also the User details for each booking. I would also like to apply a filter where IsDeleted == false for each Concert, Booking and User. I Would like to return a List of Concerts which have their Booking and User details maintained as navigational properties.</p>

<p>In SQL, this is what I am trying to achieve:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *

WHERE c.ConcertId = b.ConcertId AND b.UserId = u.UserId AND c.AdministratorId = 10
AND c.IsDeleted = false AND b.IsDeleted = false AND u.IsDeleted = false
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I am aware, using the ""Include"" method to eager load, doesn't allow filtering or subqueries of the child entity it loads in; it returns all records for that join, so I tried to use an anonymous projection as follows:</p>

<pre><code>int adminId = 10;

var concerts = _context.Concerts
    .Where(p =&gt; p.AdministratorId == adminId &amp;&amp; p.IsDeleted == false)
    .Select(p =&gt; new {
        Concerts = p,
        Bookings = p.Bookings
            .Where(q =&gt; q.IsDeleted == false &amp;&amp; q.User.IsDeleted == false)
            .Select(r =&gt; new {
                Bookings = r,
                User = r.User
            })
            .AsEnumerable()
            .Select(q =&gt; q.Bookings)
    })
    .AsEnumerable()
    .Select(p =&gt; p.Concerts)
    .ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>However, this is still returning all records and not filtering out the ones where IsDeleted = true. Anyone have any ideas, or suggestions how I can clean up this monstrous query?</p>

<p>I have also tried a method similar to this (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alexj/archive/2009/06/02/tip-22-how-to-make-include-really-include.aspx), which again fails (returns all bookings even deleted ones):</p>

<pre><code>var concertsQuery = (ObjectQuery&lt;Concert&gt;)_context.Concerts
    .Where(p =&gt; p.UserId == userId
        &amp;&amp; p.IsDeleted == false
        &amp;&amp; p.Bookings.Any(q =&gt; q.IsDeleted == false &amp;&amp; q.User.IsDeleted == false)
    );

<p>This made the VPS crash, so I tried again, but first I ran <code>umount -f -l /</code>. This seemed to work (dd wrote the image), but when I rebooted, to my surprise I was back in Ubuntu.</p>

<p>I also tried installing grub and grub2, but I could not access a boot menu for either via the console, even after setting the timeout and visibility options (I think that grub/grub2 did not <em>really</em> install, and the VPS just boots directly into the OS).</p>

<p>Does anyone have anything clever that I can try? I can wipe and restore the VPS as many times as I want, so give me any and all ideas that come to mind!</p>

<p>And it works fine, items are updated in the View.</p>

<p>Now I want to create asynchronism. With a traditional BeginInvoke in a new method that I call from the View instead of LoadData it works fine.</p>

<pre><code>public partial class MainPage : PhoneApplicationPage
{
    [...]

    private void MainPage_Loaded(object sender, System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        App.ViewModel.GetData();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I use a property that I called CurrentDispatcher, it is filled in the App.xaml.cs with App.Current.RootVisual.Dispatcher.</p>

<pre><code>public class MainViewModel : ViewModelBase
{
    [...]

    public Dispatcher CurrentDispatcher { get; set; }

    public void GetData()
    {
        this.CurrentDispatcher.BeginInvoke(new Action(LoadData));
    }

    [...]
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I would like to use Reactive Extentions. So I tried different elements of Rx like ToAsync or ToObservable for example but I had some ""UnauthorizedAccessException was unhandled"" with ""Invalid cross-thread access"" when I add an item to the Checklist.</p>

<p>I tried to ObserveOn other threads cause maybe the error comes from mix between the UI and the background threads but it doesn't work. Maybe I don't use Rx like I would be in that particular case?</p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciate.</p>

<p>EDIT after your answers:</p>

<p>Here is a code which works great!</p>

<pre><code>public void GetData()
{
    Observable.Start(() =&gt; LoadData())
    .ObserveOnDispatcher()
    .Subscribe(list =&gt;
    {
        foreach (Item it in list)
        {
            this.Checklist.Add(it);
        }
    });
}

public ObservableCollection&lt;Item&gt; LoadData()
{
    var results = new ObservableCollection&lt;Item&gt;();

    using (ItemDataContext context = new ItemDataContext(_connectionString))
    {
        //Loading

        var contextItems = from i in context.Items
                           select i;

        foreach (Item it in contextItems)
        {
            results.Add(it);
        }
    }

    return results;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you see I didn't use correctly before. Now I can use a ObservableCollection and use it in the Susbscribe. It's perfect! Thanks a lot!</p>

We registered a FocusHandler on the SuggestBox with the intention of using the requestDefaultSuggestions(Request r, Callback c) method on our implementation of SuggestOracle.  </p>

<p>The documentation informs us that the Request query should be null in order for this to work.  Easy enough.  However, the larger question is about the Callback object.</p>

<p>I assumed that I would simply create an anonymous class that implements the onSuggestionsReady method and pass that into the method call above.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>    Callback callback = new Callback() {

My searches have shown others with similar questions but I have yet to see anyone post the answer.   It seems like something one should be able to do fairly easily, so I'm not sure if I'm just confused about how to invoke the requestDefaultSuggestions method call or if I'm coming at the problem from the wrong angle.</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>So what id does, it showes link to login when user is not logged in (or to be specific - if getUser() doesnt recive anything), and paragraph with text if getUser gives what it should give (usually users prefer to put redirect there, if getUser returns 0, which gets to infinity loop described belove)</p>

<p>Simple test will show a problem. Accessing it by site url, even when user permission is given, shows login url instead of paragraph.</p>

<p>Where is the problem? 
While trying to figure it out, I have added site's url as ""App on Facebook"", so it can be accessed from inside of facebook. And eureka, if it is accessed this way (by Canvas Page url), getUser() works correctly. Whats even more, when once You have visited through Canvas Page url link, then  when visiting site directly - getUser() also works correctly.</p>

<p>So where is the catch?
Trying with browser's incognito function i have figured otu, that there is something stored on user browser. Visiting site directly from a browser, where user already have been on Canvas Page url shows correct responce, while when on a browser where user havent visited Canvas Page url, shows login url. </p>

<p>So it seams, that the problem is somehow connected with browser cache, and facebook doesnt set it correct way when visiting throught page instead of Canvas Page itself.</p>

<p>Also, when acces to app is given, when user clicks on login link, he is automatically redirected back to oryginal page with state and code as _GET parameters, so when in code one puts auto redirect -  infinity loop with diffrent state and code value in link everytime redirect fires happends.</p>

<p>Anybody have an idea how to correct this issue working only with php sdk?</p>

<p>Browser uses EventSource(url) to connect to server. Spring accepts the request with the following controller code:</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value=""myurl"", method = RequestMethod.GET, produces = ""text/event-stream"")
@ResponseBody
public DeferredResult&lt;String&gt; subscribe() throws Exception {
    final DeferredResult&lt;String&gt; deferredResult = new DeferredResult&lt;&gt;();
    resultList.add(deferredResult);

    deferredResult.onCompletion(() -&gt; {
        logTimer.info(""deferedResult ""+deferredResult+"" completion"");
        resultList.remove(deferredResult);
    });
    return deferredResult;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So mainly it puts the DeferredResult in a List and register a completion callback so that i can remove this thing from the List in case of completion. </p>

<p>Now i have a timer method, that will periodically output current timestamp to all registered ""browser"" via their DeferredResults.</p>

<pre><code>@Scheduled(fixedRate=10000)
public void processQueues() {
    Date d = new Date();
    log.info(""outputting to ""+ LoginController.resultList.size()+ "" connections"");
    LoginController.resultList.forEach(deferredResult -&gt; deferredResult.setResult(""data: ""+d.getTime()+""\n\n""));
}
</code></pre>

<p>The data is sent to the browser and the following client code works:</p>

<pre><code> var source = new EventSource('/myurl');
   source.addEventListener('message', function (e) {
            console.log(e.data);
            $(""#content"").append(e.data).append(""&lt;br&gt;"");
        });
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Now the problem:</strong></p>

<p>The completion callback on the DeferredResult is called on every setResult() call in the timer thread. So for some reason the connection is closed after the setResult() call. SSE in the browser reconnects as per spec and then same thing again. So on client side i have a polling  behavior, but i want an kept open request where i can push data on the same DeferredResult over and over again.</p>

<p>Do i miss something here? Is DeferredResult not capable of sending multiple results?  i put in a 10 seconds delay in the timer thread to see if the request only terminates after setResult(). So in the browser the request is kept open until the timer pushes the data but then its closed. </p>

<p>Thanks for any hint on that. One more note: I added async-supported to all filters/servlets in tomcat.</p>

<p>During some tests, I found a weird error. On the penultimate line with <code>realloc</code> netBeans (gcc compiler) gives me a ""signal"" which I assume are like runtime exceptions. The dialogue box reads that the error is SIGABRT, and it aborts the program while not in debugging mode. I have found that this error only occurs when count is an odd number. Even when I modify realloc's arguments so that it always passes even numbers, there is still an error. But when I modify count to only be even at the beginning of the function, it works fine. I can't figure out why this strange details cause this strange behavior.</p>

<p>The log is an app in my general project</p>

from django.contrib import admin

url(r'^$', include('log.urls', namespace='log')),
url(r'^log/', include('log.urls', namespace='log')),
url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
]

<p>Here is my Project/log/urls.py :</p>

<pre><code>from django.conf.urls import url
from . import views

urlpatterns = [

 url(r'^login$', views.login, name='login'),
 url(r'^logout$', views.logout, name='logout'),
 url(r'^create$', views.create, name='create'),
 ]
</code></pre>

<p>Then I defined my function create in the Project/log/views.py :</p>

<pre><code>def create(request):
  if request.method == ""POST"" and request.POST['name'] and request.POST['password']:
      name_p = escape(request.POST['name'])

      except:
          user = User.objects.create_user(name_p, name_p+'@email.com', pass_p)
          user.save()
          return HttpResponseRedirect('log:index')

  else:
      return render(request, 'log/index.html', {'error_message' : 'You did\'t fill the entire form',})
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know where is my mistake because the form is a simple one with no arguments passed and the regular expression in the url is a simple one too. It must be a problem in my function I think. If someone could lead me to the right path to fix this kind of error that would be great ;)</p>

<p>I have the source compiled correctly and nothing seems to be wrong. Here is a little snippet of my code. I can send the full source but as I have done a huge project I don't really feel the need to post all of that here for this one issue. Also, I can't imagine that you would need the full source to solve this anyways</p>

} else if(rc != SSH_AUTH_SUCCESS) {
    ssh_disconnect(my_session);

<p>Now, my issue is that the ssh_connect() function runs perfectly fine as I have watched the netstat on another SSH host that I am using and an established connection is made from the client to the server. However, the ssh_userauth_password() function seems to just hang and never respond until I manually kill it. I have tried this on multiple of my SSH hosts and I get the same results every single time.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed I have allowed the ssh_connect to be verbose and here is the result.</p>

<p>gcc test.c -lssh --- is how I am compiling it.</p>

<p>I also tried this on a CentOS 6.4 VPS I have and compiled it with virtually the same packages listed above, and ran the same exact test all all 5 of my SSH hosts and got the same results.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help, I hope I explained my problem well enough for this to be solved. Any clarification that is needed, I can do. I tried to post everything relevant to the problem.</p>

For example, if the user needs to fill out employment information, typing in the business name would provide a list of matching businesses, then clicking one would fill out all of the address fields. However, we can't use it because of the restrictions on google's api. We have a closed https app which just makes it out of the question.</p>

<p>Because of the https requirement, we have to use the server as a proxy which means a pretty lenient usage restriction. That makes Bing a good choice. The REST api seems like a great way to go, and it works well enough, but with one problem. The center point location needs to be specified as a latitude and longitude. Users will be supplying the information in a zipcode or city/state format. This clearly means geocoding. What is the best route to take? Is there a good way to get around geocoding that I'm missing? Looking at the Bing APIs, it appears that geocoding is offered as a SOAP web service that costs money. If I'm doing that should I just use google maps for geocoding - there's an enterprise version of maps with https? Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>So I want the user to upload a JSON-file. In a input-field the user also types the collection-name which has to be used for the import. After this the JSON-array should be saved to the given collection.</p>

<p><strong>HTML:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;template name=""importJSON""&gt;
    &lt;form id=""importJson""&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" id=""collection""&gt;
        &lt;input type=""file"" id=""file""&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

<pre><code>Template.importJSON.events({
    'submit #importJson': function(e){
        e.preventDefault();
        var collection = e.target.collection.value;
        var obj = JSON.parse(response);
        db.collection.insert(obj);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>So I have three problems with that:</p>

<p>1) How do I have to do the upload itself, as the file should be uploaded temporarily</p>

<p>2) How can I use the collection name given in the input-field?</p>

<p>3) How do I import the data in a correct way? Insert would just append the new data to the existing data, wouldn't it?</p>

<p><strong>FIXED</strong></p>

<p>There was no bug in the IabHelper Class. I had to store the orderId value I was getting from JSON response as a SharedPreference key/value pair. </p>

<p>Something like this.</p>

<pre><code>SharedPreferences settings = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(getApplicationContext());
            SharedPreferences.Editor editor = settings.edit();
            editor.putString(""productId"", sku);
            editor.putString(""purchaseToken"", purchaseToken);
            editor.putString(""orderId"", orderId);
            editor.commit();
</code></pre>

<p>Retrieve them.</p>

<pre><code>SharedPreferences spreferences = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(getApplicationContext());
            productId = spreferences.getString(""productId"", """");
            purchaseToken = spreferences.getString(""purchaseToken"", """");
            orderId = spreferences.getString(""orderId"", """");
</code></pre>

<p>and finally use the if condition to make view visible or invisible</p>

<pre><code>if(orderId.isEmpty()) {


                entryFee.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
                paymentButton.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
                paymentText.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
                teamTextField.setVisibility(View.GONE);
                btn.setVisibility(View.GONE);
                paymentButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onClick(View v) {

                        skuList.add(inappid);
                        querySkus = new Bundle();
                        querySkus.putStringArrayList(""ITEM_ID_LIST"", skuList);

                        checkPayment();


                    }
                });

<p>The anchorOffset and focusOffset are swapped when replacing a range.  i.e. The anchor resets to the leftmost end of the selection and the focus to the rightmost, regardless of from which end the selection actually started and ended.  It seems the anchor and focus are ignored when adding a range (or at least not stored), and it defaults and assumes left anchor and right focus.</p>

<p>This is a damn nuisance!</p>

<p>I don't hold out much hope, but is there any way I'm missing that I can work around this behavior.  I would really love to be able to restore the original anchor and focus positions.</p>

s.collapse(aN,aO);
s.extend(fN,fO);

One represents the button surface and its dimensions match the dimensions of the button. The second one is a sign on the button and it is smaller than the button. Think about a Stop button as an example.</p>

<p>I'm trying to use the combination of setIntrinsicWidth/setIntrinsicHeight and setLayerInset to place the sign into the button center but I get a strange result.</p>

<pre><code>public Drawable createStopButtonDrawable(int width, int height) {
    //-- width = 60, height = 30
    ShapeDrawable button = new ShapeDrawable(new RectShape());      
    button.setIntrinsicHeight(height);
    button.setIntrinsicWidth(width);
    button.setShaderFactory(new ShapeDrawable.ShaderFactory() {         
        @Override
        public Shader resize(int width, int height) {
            return new LinearGradient(0, 0, 0, height, 
                    new int[]{0xCDCCCCCC, 0xCDFFFFFF, 0xCDCCCCCC}, 
                    new float[]{0, 0.3f, 1},
                    Shader.TileMode.REPEAT);
        }
    });


    ShapeDrawable sign = new ShapeDrawable(new RectShape());
    int signSize = (int)(STOP_SIGN_SIZE_RATIO * (float)Math.min(width, height));
    //-- signSize = 12
    sign.setIntrinsicHeight(signSize);
    sign.setIntrinsicWidth(signSize);
    Paint psPaint = sign.getPaint();
    psPaint.setStyle(Style.FILL);
    psPaint.setColor(PLAY_BUTTON_SIGN_COLOR);

    Drawable[] layers = new Drawable[]{ button, sign };
    LayerDrawable ld = new LayerDrawable(layers);
    ld.setBounds(0, 0, width, height);
    ld.setLayerInset(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);

    int sx = (int)( (width - signSize)/2.0f );
    //-- sx = 24
    int sy = (int)( (height - signSize)/2.0f );
    //-- sy = 9

    ld.setLayerInset(1, sx, sy, sx, sy);   //-- 1. Sign stretched
    //ld.setLayerInset(1, sx, 10, sx, 9);  //-- 2. Almost good
    return ld;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This produces the button with the sign stretched to match the button size.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LB4F5.png"" alt=""Sign stretched""></p>

<p>However, if I replace the line ""1. Sign stretched"" with ""2. Almost good"", I get almost the expected result.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/P464h.png"" alt=""Sign is almost right""></p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>I've noticed also that the displayed button surface has the size 59x29, not the expected 60x30.</p>

<p><code>&lt;p&gt;Date: &lt;input type=""text"" id=""datepicker""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>

<p>I thought that's all what was needed for it to work but i guess i was wrong because the datepicker doesn't show and this is all i get</p>

<p>I have a function to do it all but I need to return a true or false value to the calling function to specify whether to submit the form or not.</p>

<p>My AJAX call is being processed correctly but where I set the flag to show that the CAPTCHA was not valid is not being set.</p>

<p>I'm not explaining that well so here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>function validateComment(isReply)
{ 
    formValid = true;
    if (isReply) { qualifier = ""Reply""; } else { qualifier = ""New""; }
    $(""#comment"" + qualifier + ""Error"").hide();

            {
                $(""#comment"" + qualifier + ""Error"").html(""&lt;p&gt;Incorrect CAPTCHA entered&lt;/p&gt;"");
                $(""#comment"" + qualifier + ""Error"").slideDown();

        }
    );
    alert(formValid);
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where I set <code>formValid = false</code> is not working for some reason, it's not being set so with the code above <code>formValid</code> is always true which is incorrect.</p>

<p>I'm guessing this has something to do with how things are being processed.</p>

<p>Any ideas as to why and how I can fix this?</p>

<p>From the above code when data is less it maps widths on the pdf correctly. But when column values are big and adjusted, the column widths calculated doesn't map to the correct pdfCell width.</p>

<p>Main highlights are:-</p>

<ol>
<li>Data is filled inside a jtable</li>
<li>Table width is adjusted using TableColumnAdjuster</li>
<li>New column widths are stored inside a list</li>
<li>On print button these widths are used to print PdfCells on PdfPTable.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please suggest something to map table cell width on the pdf.  </p>

<p>Can anyone confirm these are the correct results to be expected?</p>

<hr>

<p>Here is the basic algorithm that I derived from the examples:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
{
    private int skip;
    private int? take;

    public Foo Skip(int value)
    {
        if (value &lt; 0)
            value = 0;

        this.skip += value;

        if (this.take.HasValue)
            this.take -= value;

        return this;
    }

    public Foo Take(int value)
    {
        if (value &lt; 0)
            value = 0;

        if (!this.take.HasValue || value &lt; this.take)
            this.take = value;

        return this;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea how I can confirm if this is the correct algorithm?</p>

<p>What I need is a SQL query to go through all the <code>meta_values</code> and look for specific custom meta tags in my case <code>&lt;date1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;date2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;date3&gt;</code> and see if they have any value inside the tags and retrieve the <code>post_id</code> and create a array to then create links to those pages (see image above).</p>

<p>So lets say the code goes through the SQL DB and like the image bellow has no values between the dates tags it will ignore it and only retrieve the <code>post_id</code> 710 and create a array of the ids to then create links.   </p>

"29169373","1","","","2015-03-20 14:49:29","","0","276","<p>I have two web applications running on the same WebSphere 8.5.5 server.  The first application is able to use expression language (EL) in the web.xml to access JVM variables like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;context-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;log4jConfigLocation&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/config/log4j-${app.env}.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/context-param&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This allows me to set a JVM variable named app.env on the server that determines which log4j configuration file is used. This variable is set to rad, test, or production according to the environment. </p>

<p>Furthermore, because these applications will run in a clustered environment but log to the same network share, I need to use EL in the log4j configuration file to differentiate the log files.  This is achieved using EL in the log4j config files like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;appender name=""file"" class=""com.example.util.CustodianDailyRollingFileAppender""&gt;
    &lt;param name=""maxNumberOfDays"" value=""10"" /&gt;
    &lt;param name=""compressBackups"" value=""yes"" /&gt;
    &lt;param name=""File"" value=""/netshare/logs/${app.serv}_app.log"" /&gt;
    &lt;layout class=""org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout""&gt;
        &lt;param name=""ConversionPattern"" value=""[%d] %-5p %c - %m%n"" /&gt;
    &lt;/layout&gt;
&lt;/appender&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The app.serv JVM variable is set to ""1"" on the first server in the cluster and ""2"" on the second, this results in a log file for each server being created named 1_app.log and 2_app.log respectively.  </p>

<p>The first application uses Servlets 2.4 and Spring Framework 3.0.4.</p>

<p>In the second application I'm trying to use this same scheme for my log files but, I'm using Servlets 3.0 and not using Spring Framework, instead trying to stick to JEE6.  However, the EL is not being evaluated in the web.xml or the log4j configuration files.  </p>

<p>If I put EL in the second application's web.xml then log4j throws an exception because it can't find the configuration file at the location defined because the EL hasn't been evaluated:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;context-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;log4jConfiguration&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/log4j2-${app.env}.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/context-param&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This results in an exception because log4j is looking for log4j2-${app.env}.xml instead of log4j2-rad.xml.  </p>

<p>Similarly, if I hard code the config location and attempt to use EL in the log4j2 configuration the EL does not get evaluated and I end up with log file named ${app.serv}_app.log when it should be evaluating the EL and naming the file 1_app.log.</p>

<p>Which brings up my questions:  </p>

<p>1) What is the difference between Application 1 and Application 2 that is causing EL in my web.xml and log4j configuration to not be evaluated?</p>

<p>2) How can I make EL work in my web.xml and log4j configuration files in Application 2?</p>

<p>It's possible to do something like this with the OpenCV implementation instead using a feature extractor algorithm? Can I just create Mat objects with the features I defined? and add them to the bowTrainer? if possible, how?</p>

<p>I'm following this tutorial:

<p>Each socket is managed by a <code>struct bufferevent</code>, and I also have a data structure which keeps track of application state for that socket:</p>

<pre><code>bev = bufferevent_socket_new(evbase, -1, BEV_OPT_CLOSE_ON_FREE);
bufferevent_socket_connect_hostname(bev, dns_base, AF_UNSPEC, host, port_number);
struct stream_data *data = malloc(sizeof(struct stream_data));
/* initialize stream data here */
bufferevent_setcb(bev, read_cb, write_cb, event_cb, data);
</code></pre>

<p>In a callback from some other buffer socket, I decide I don't need the buffer I just tried to open. This happens <em>before</em> I get the connected callback on the bev in question. Because I created it with <code>BEV_OPT_CLOSE_ON_FREE</code>, I just free it. Then I delete the data structure I'm using. Looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>bufferevent_free(bev);
free(stream_data); // the data corresponding to that bev
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, though, the socket actually finished connecting in the meantime. So my event callback fires:</p>

<pre><code>void event_cb(struct bufferevent *bev, short what, void *ctx)
{
    struct stream_data *data = ctx;
    // data now points to already freed memory
}
</code></pre>

<p>And now I've got a pointer to already freed memory. I've confirmed with debugger breakpoints, <code>NSLog</code>, etc that the event callback is firing after the <code>free</code> above.</p>

<p>Is this expected behavior? If so, how can I ever tell that a bufferevent I freed is well and truly gone, making it safe to remove my own data structures?</p>

However, if I expand the Flash presentation to 1680x1200, the freshly loaded image still goes offscreen. <strong>Is there any way to load the jpg (or png, or whatever) to take advantage of the displayed resolution of the Flash presentation?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I realize this question is hard to read, so any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>This issue have also been discussed in: <a href=""https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/2492"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/2492</a></p>

<p>The problem is if the app is only allowed to run in Landscape orientation, not when you use Portrait or both.</p>

<hr>

<p>Got a android game coded in monogame, where I got a <code>GraphicsDeviceManager</code> which are set to <code>FullScreen=true</code>.</p>

<p>I use the <code>GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Height</code> and the <code>GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Width</code> to determine the resolution of the device. 
This was working very good until I got an samsung update and had to turn FastDev off. 
The big mysterious problem:</p>

<p>When I debug with the pc, the height and width of the <code>viewport</code> is set correct. But when i unplug and play the app after 1-2 times the <code>viewport.Height</code> becomes the devices width, and the <code>viewport.Width</code> becomes the device height, which completely makes the game unplayable. </p>

<p>Its very hard to find the solution, since this is never happening when i debug and got the cable in from pc to the device.</p>

<p>Anyone got any ideas what it can be?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>I can now confirm that it is because of the samsung update</strong></p>

<p>I made worlds simplest android app to test it, just got a mainframe with a background image called ""bg"" and a spritefront printing out the viewport.Width and viewport.Height.</p>

<p>When deploying from VS everything is good, the viewport.width is the actual device width and the viewport.height is the actual device height. But when trying to deploy it from the Samsung Galaxy S4 active (sometimes you need to try 2-3 times) then all of a sudden Viewport.Height is the device Width and the other way around, which makes the background picture just cover a bit of the screen.</p>

<p>For example, an order might contain a collection of order items in a single POST requested that is used to create an order. Both, order and order-item do exist as a resource. However, I would very much like to have only one request that would create order and order item entities. Handling that in the resource is not a problem, but I wonder how you would configure that resource (let´s call it order-place) using the apigiliy UI - or, if at all impossible, using the configuration. Applying validators and filters is one of the key features of apigility, and i´d like to keep using that, even for complex request data. </p>

<p>Here is my code.</p>

<pre><code>issue = Issue.new(

  :project_id =&gt; 1,
  :description =&gt; $description,
  :custom_field_values =&gt; {""6"" =&gt; ""Thomas""},
)
</code></pre>

<p>All the fields work fine, except for the last one named :custom_field_values. It won’t add the custom field when I run the script</p>

<p>When I check the server log the post request shows custom_field_values as a key of custom_field_values which prevents my import from working</p>

<p>This is the server log</p>

<pre><code>Parameters: {""issue""=&gt;{""assigned_to_id""=&gt;1, ""custom_field_values""=&gt;
{""custom_field_values""=&gt;{""6""=&gt;""Thomas""}}, ""description""=&gt;""placeholder text"", 
""project_id""=&gt;1, ""subject""=&gt;"" Feedback""}}

<p>When I created a ticket though the redmine interface the correct JSON looks like this.</p>

<p>As far as I understood, I just proceed this way:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Derive a custom TLC from the grt.tlc file using the ""Custom Target"" example in the RTW Embedded Coder documentation, which does NOT require RTWEC, only RTW.</p></li>
<li><p>Derive a custom TMF from the grt_vc.tmf file. </p></li>
<li><p>Finally derive a C file.</p></li>

struct Car {
  shared_ptr&lt;Engine&gt; engine;
  int car_data;

<p>For performance reasons, I want to make them tightly packed in memory (but I don't want to lose the flexibility of the design). So, I can create a ""packed"" structure, and a factory that will transparently return a new B instance:</p>

<pre><code>struct PackedCarAndEngine {
    Engine engine;
    Car car;
};

shared_ptr&lt;Car&gt; new_Car() {
    shared_ptr&lt;PackedCarAndEngine&gt; packed = make_shared&lt;PackedCarAndEngine&gt;();

    // uses aliasing shared_ptr constructor
    packed-&gt;car.engine = shared_ptr&lt;Engine&gt;(packed, &amp;packed-&gt;engine);

    // again
    shared_ptr&lt;Car&gt; car = shared_ptr&lt;Car&gt;(packed, &amp;packed-&gt;car);

    return car;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that this ""car"" instance will never be destroyed, because it have a reference count of two. When it dies, it will have a reference count of one, forever. Do you know a better way to keep using the internal shared_ptr's (so that I can attribute an ""unpacked"" reference if I want), and still make this packed structure?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I could use a no-op deleter, but then it would be very dangerous if I decide to keep the <code>engine</code> but not the <code>car</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    // ...
    packed-&gt;car.engine = shared_ptr&lt;Engine&gt;(&amp;packed-&gt;engine, do_nothing_deleter);
    // ...

shared_ptr&lt;Car&gt; my_car = new_Car();
shared_ptr&lt;Engine&gt; my_engine = my_car-&gt;engine;
my_car.reset(); // Danger: engine was destroyed here!!!
cout &lt;&lt; my_engine-&gt;engine_data; // Crash!

<p>It seems that on initialization the master and workers (separate processes) <em>sometimes</em> get out of sync if I start them up using a shell script.  However, I've never seen this if I start them up in any order manually (in separate console windows).  I'm beginning to consider adding a sleep() after each process binds/connects to the sockets to avoid this apparent heisenbug -- but I'm also wondering if I'm just being stupid.  Any advice?</p>

<p>Here is what the shell script that occasionally fails looks like.  The master talks to the workers using both a PUB and a PUSH and also gets info back using a PULL socket.  I think the heisenbug is caused when a PUB message from the master sometimes is not seen by one of the workers.</p>

<pre><code>echo ""starting worker A in background""
python pWorkerA.py &gt; /tmp/A.out &amp;

We have a strange situation using CKEDITOR where we are getting back a dorked up string of html. This has happened 7 times out of about 1000 submissions and has always been inside tables.</p>

<p>The html returned by the CKEDITOR getData() method looks great for the first +-4000 characters (that length may be irrelevant, I just noticed they all seem to break down in the range of 3900 - 4100 characters).</p>

<p>Then at some point in the middle of a table we run into this situation (line breaks and indents are mine):</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;table&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
  ...Missing subsequent tr's in this table
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that a padding style got chopped off along with the rest of its corresponding attribute &amp; element. In fact, the entire rest of the table was cut out, all subsequent cells and rows.</p>

<p>The curious thing about all of this is that the user who submits the content does not see the corruption, it isn't noticed until the user who reviews it takes a look.</p>

<p>We've interviewed the users who have submitted the data, and they don't seem to be doing anything advanced: no copy/paste from word, they are not manipulating the tables (ie, we give them the table as part of a template, they just fill it out).</p>

<p>The worst part about this is that I have no instructions for reproducing.  It just seems to crop up once out of several dozen attempts.  I've tried everything: mashed buttons; pasted foreign characters; hooked it up to an automated test runner for 2 hours; tried insulting it. Cannot figure out how they are doing this.</p>

<p>The function looks like:</p>

<pre><code>Sub Advance(ByRef listRecords() As String)
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>Advance</code> I can print something like:</p>

<pre><code>UBound(listRecords)
</code></pre>

<p>And it returns a 6.</p>

<p>But when I try to print out the values like <code>listRecords(1)</code> or <code>listRecords(2)</code> etc, nothing gets printed out (blank).</p>

<p>Why is this? It doesn't crash, so it's not an invalid range in the array at all.</p>

<p>I can toss together a test but I imagine someone has already scoped out the performance and practical pitfalls of using this as a transition technique. I would be interested in hearing any details - for example, does the UIImageView animation restart or does it continue apace?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%=f.hidden_field 'user_id', :value =&gt; current_user.id %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, I now need to add a 'keyholder', who has read-only access to this folder. I have a list of links, which only appear if the user has added a folder, or the keyholder can set one up for them.</p>

<p>The keyholder is a regular user themselves, so the above code would only set up a folder with their own id, not that of the person whose account they are accessing. The keyholder has an 'access_id' that matches the user id of the the person whose account they can access. </p>

<p>How do I set it up so that the form is capturing the right user id?</p>

<p>What I'm trying to acheive is the following (this doesn't work, but might give a better idea of what I mean):</p>

(at least that's what I'm calling it here).</p>

<p>To understand what this means, take a look at the link. </p>

<p>Out of all the features in use in modern text editors, initial research seems to indicate that this is one feature that <em>both</em> Emacs and Vim do not actually support. If correct, this would be pretty exceptional since it's quite difficult to find a text editor feature that has not made its way into at least <em>one</em> of these two old-school editors.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Has anyone ever seen or implemented this feature in either Emacs, Vim, or both? If so, please point me to a link, script, reference or summary that explains the details.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> In response to the down-votes, please note <em>I didn't ask whether the feature was ""needed""</em>. I asked a simple yes/no question, whether it was <em>implemented</em>. I didn't invent the feature. I'm just researching it. <em>I don't give a rats ~~~ who does or doesn't like it</em>.</p>

<p>If you know an alternate way to do the same (or similar) thing, that's fine, but please try to save the soap-boxing and advocacy for people who seek out that kind of fluffy subjective response on SO. If you can't answer an objective question without putting on your editor-religious-warrior costume, <em>please kindly refrain from responding</em>.</p>

I've got a problem with my student project.My Tutor wants to grab frames from a Camera and save the grabbed frames into jpg. So first I used <code>""cvCreateCameraCapture，cvQueryFrame，cvSaveImage""</code> and it worded ok. But the frame is relative big,about 2500x2000,and it takes about 1 second to save one Frame. But my Tutor requires at least to save 10 Frames per second.</p>

<p>Then I came out the ideas to save raw data first and after grabbing process  I can save them into Jpg. So I wrote following test code.But the problem is that all the saved Images are the same and it seems they are just from the data of the last grabbed frame.I guess the problem is about my poor knowledge of c++ especially pointers.So I really hope to get help here.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Once packaged, the ear file looks like:</p>

<p>and the ejb.jar manifest is:</p>

<pre>
Manifest-Version: 1.0

</pre>

<p>Note that logging from the war package works (Servlet logging + EJB logging using the WEB-INF/lib directory) and according to what I found, logging in the EJB should work when deploying the ear (if the manifest is correct).</p>

"14858935","1","14859703","","2013-02-13 17:04:40","","1","515","<p>On the calling page, I bind my fancyBox using an href, like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a id=""myId"" href=""myContent.cfm""&gt;Click me&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $('a#myId').fancybox({
            // my initialization params 
        });
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In myContent.cfm, a default ""filter"" is built, which has add and delete buttons. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""fd_0"" class=""eachFilter blank""&gt;
    &lt;select name=""filterBy"" class=""fl filterBy""&gt;
        &lt;option selected=""selected""&gt;-- Add a Filter --&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;!--- add more options ---&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;button type=""button"" class=""addFilter default"" title=""Add a filter to the current filter set.""&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;button type=""button"" class=""deleteThisFilter default"" title=""Delete this filter from the current filter set.""&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When the addFilter button is clicked, a new ""default"" filter is added to the dom after the filter that was clicked, using consecutive ids. Conversely, clicking the deleteFilter button causes that filter to be deleted and all remaining filters to have their ids renumbered; with the exception that there must be one filter remaining. My original code used .live() to attach event handlers to the newly created elements, like so:</p>

<pre><code>$('.addFilter).live('click', function(){        
    // get number of existing filters
    // create new blank filter
    // add to the dom after the filter whose button was just clicked
});
$('.deleteThisFilter).live('click', function(){     
    // if there is more than one existing filter, use .remove() to remove the parent .eachFilter div
    // renumber the existing filter ids consecutively
});
</code></pre>

<p>After the user has created all the ""filters"" they need, they may either ""apply"" them, which closes the fancybox and reloads a grid with the new, filtered parameters, or simply cancel and close the fancybox.</p>

<p>This all works fine the first time, and on reopening the fancybox, the initial blank filter's add button works as expected. However, after adding a second filter, any filter that was added to the dom has multiple event handlers added to the addFilter and deleteFilter buttons. If I added one filter the first time, then return to the fancybox the second time, then add a filter by clicking on the default filter's add button, then click on the newly created filters add button, two more filters are added. If I close, reopen the fancybox a second time, add a filter, and click on that filters add button, three more filters are added.</p>

<p>So here's what I've tried so far:</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Changing the <em>.live(</em>) calls to </p>

<pre><code>$(document).on('click', 'addFilter', function(){ // add my filter code});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Putting the code to create the filters into a function, which at the end uses <em>.bind()</em> to add the event handlers to the newly created filters; followed by using </p>

<pre><code>$('.addFilter').unbind('click', fnCreateMyFilter()) 
</code></pre>

<p>on closing the fancybox.</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> Using <em>.live()</em> ONLY on the newly created filter elements, and a regular click handler on the default element</p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> Upgrading jQuery to 1.8.3 from our current version</p>

<p><strong>5)</strong> Calling <em>.remove()</em> on all elements inside the fancybox <em>.onClosed</em> function (although I was under the impression that closing fancybox does actually remove the elements from the dom).</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

help is much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
Here is the code:</p>

<p>I have a class that has 2 properties: DataA and DataB; it doesn't matter what they are, what is important is that each can be calculated from the other. I'm in a multithreaded environment and want DataA / DataB to be calculated when and if it is necessary (it's not always the case that both will be accessed). My first thought was something like... </p>

<pre><code>public SomeDataObject DataA
{
    get
    {
        if (dataAisAvailable)
        {
            return dataA;
        }
        else
        {
            if (dataBisAvailable)
            {
                lock (dataACalcLock)
                {
                    // Don't want other threads recalculating dataA
                    if (dataAisAvailable)
                    {
                        return dataA;
                    }

                    ////////////////////////////////
                    // Calculate dataA from dataB //
                    ////////////////////////////////

                    dataAisAvailable = true;
                    return dataA;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                return null;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>With this pattern, assuming that dataB is indeed available, the first thread arriving on the scene (let's call it thread1) goes in and calculates dataA, all good so far... However, any threads that have been waiting around for dataA to be calculated now have to access it one-by-one... not very efficient imho. I'd like to have these threads waiting for thread1 to finish calculating dataA, and then all go for it as though there is no lock.</p>

<p>I've had other thoughts with ManualResetEvents perhaps, but I'm not sure how I can safely ensure that one and exactly one thread passes through to do the calculation. </p>

<p>I hope I've explained that clearly, although I'm not convinced that I have. Happy to clarify though...</p>

Interestingly, the program crashes during normal execution and GDB, but not Valgrid. </p>

<p>To help you follow along with the code, heres the basic point of the program:
Communicate with a server via sockets and UDP to transfer a file, and handle some basic packet loss. </p>

<p>I won't share the server's code, because I know the issue isn't there. 
The point that might confuse some, is that I'm implementing packet loss myself, with a number generator. Right now it doesn't do anything really, besides make the program use another recvfrom. </p>

<p>To guide you throught the programs output, the client tells the server what file it wants, the server tells the client how big the file is it's going to send, and then sends it in chunks (of 10 characters at a time). </p>

<p>The output shows what chunk is sent, how many characters were received, and what the concatenated string is. </p>

<p>The file transfer succeeds from what i can tell, its just the fopen call that I use to write the received file that is giving me trouble. Not sure if it's to do with my malloc call or not. </p>

<pre><code>string = string .replace(/\)/, "" )""); //Removes the bracket
string = string .replace(/\s\)/, "" )""); //Removes the bracket and the space

When a query execution results in an empty dataset then the query execution time on on my local system is nearly the same for all the data access methods.</p>

<p>When the same tests are executed on a hosted ASP.NET and MS SQL environment then in the case of non-empty dataset returned there is no any significant difference in EF/LINQ performance. And when an empty dataset is returned then EF/LINQ is running ~10 slower than other data access methods from my tests.</p>

<p>Here is the list of all the data access methods I have tested:</p>

<ul>
<li>ADO      - ado.net typed records, stored procedure,</li>
<li>ODS      - ASP.NET ObjectDataSource, stored procedure,</li>
<li>EF/SP    - entity framework, stored procedure,</li>
<li>EF/LINQ  - pure LINQ for EF,</li>
<li>RDR      - SqlReader, text SQL command,</li>
<li>PetaPoco - PetaPoco, text SQL command</li>
</ul>

<p>The same stored procedure is used in tests with ADO, ODS, EF/SP.
Tests queries' parameters are getting changed.</p>

<p>Here are the tests' stats, time in seconds, an MS SQL database with a couple of millions records in the main production tables is queried, about 300 returned.</p>

<p>Local system:</p>

<ul>
<li>ADO:      0.4298s</li>
<li>ODS:      0.4828s </li>
<li>EF/SP:    0.4349s </li>
<li>EF/LINQ:  0.0178s  !!!</li>
<li>RDR:      0.4173s</li>
<li>PetaPoco: 0.4260s</li>
</ul>

<p>ASP.NET and MS SQL Hosting on virtual servers:</p>

<ul>
<li>ADO:      0.5290s</li>
<li>ODS:      0.6623s</li>

<li>RDR:      0.5194s</li>
<li>PetaPoco: 0.6204s</li>

<p>Here are test stats results for the case when query parameters define empty result set:</p>

<p>Questions:  </p>

<p>Have you observed such a phenomenon ever?<br>
Do you have any explanation for this phenomenon?<br>
It looks like ASP.NET Web application(?) + EF use direct access to the MS SQL memory when they are both running on the same system?</p>

For that I downloaded the JLayer 1.0.1 library and added it to my project. I also added the MP3 files to a package on my project -as well as some JPG images- so as to obtain them from there, and I'm using a hashmap (mapa) and this method to get them:</p>

<pre><code>public static String consiguePath (int i) {


return AppUtils.class.getClass().getResource(""/Movimiento/"" + mapa.get(i)).getPath();

}
</code></pre>

<p>so as to avoid absolute paths.</p>

<p>When I open an MP3 file I do this:</p>

<pre><code>try {
                            File archivo = new File(AppUtils.consiguePath(12));
                            FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(archivo);
                            BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis);

</code></pre>

<p>The whole thing runs perfectly in NetBeans, but when I build a .jar file and execute it it runs well but it won't open the MP3 files. What called my attention is that it doesn't have trouble in opening the JPG files that are on the same package.</p>

<p>After generating the .jar I checked the MyProject/build/classes/Movimiento folder and all of the MP3 files were actually there, so I don't know what may be happening.</p>

<pre><code>class SomeAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    class Media:

    			""/static/js/lib/jquery-1.3.2.min.js"",

            ...
            ..
            .
</code></pre>

<p>It seems the admin includes all the normal js files:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/media/js/core.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/media/js/admin/RelatedObjectLookups.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/media/js/getElementsBySelector.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/media/js/urlify.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then any custom ones you specify as above, and <em>then</em> if you have specified any filter_horizontal/vertical fields, the following</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""/media/js/SelectBox.js"" type=""text/javascript""/&gt;
&lt;script src=""/media/js/SelectFilter2.js"" type=""text/javascript""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which is a touch annoying as I would like to modify the resulting pair of select boxes.</p>

<p>Is it possible to change the order of the  tags in the django admin? </p>

<p>Failing that, is it possible in jquery to have some code run after <em>everything</em> else, I normally use $(document).ready(....), are there any events fired after this?</p>

<p><strong>extra info</strong></p>

<p>Quick update incase anyone wanted to the route alex vasi suggested spelt out, you can extend the admin templates by using a file like:</p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""admin/change_form.html"" %}

{% block extrahead %}{{ block.super }}
    &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/static/js/admin/app/model/somefile.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
{% endblock %}
</code></pre>

<p>I placed this in /path/to/project/templates/admin/app/model/change_form.html, and its done.</p>

As a user navigates between menu items, the content that was last shown for a given menu item is displayed, so that the user can go back and forth between two areas to compare information. This involves having a main display region with a separate region for each ""page"" (i.e. UserControl for displaying content for the menu selection) nested within it.</p>

<p>Each page contains at least one instance of a particular control, and that control has a <code>DependencyProperty</code> with a <code>PropertyChangedCallback</code> handler. What I've noticed is that, when the page is navigated to, all the controls on the page that have collections bound to them trigger the control's <code>PropertyChangedCallback</code> handler (which is what I want) but none of the non-collection bindings do.</p>

<p>I can see that navigating to a page triggers the <code>NavigatedTo</code> event on the main (outer) region. I don't want the NavigatedTo event on the page-specific (inner) region to be triggered, so that's fine. But what I don't get is why <em>any</em> of the controls or bindings in the inner region would be notified of a change when it's the outer region getting the event.</p>

<p>Each collection binding is a <code>ListCollectionView</code> over <code>ObservableCollection</code>, and each collection item implements <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code>.</p>

<p>My questions are these:</p>

<ol>
<li>What event is each collection handling that my non-collections are not, triggering the dependency property change?</li>
<li>Why does navigating to the outer region affect the controls in the inner region? What event must the inner region be receiving?</li>

        return (DataObject);
    })
</code></pre>

<p>That part works fine. The problem is, I also want to add angular accessor methods to allow me to get/set nested values like gender. something like:</p>

<pre><code>get gender(){ return this.phys.gender; }
</code></pre>

<p>I can not figure out how to use that syntax with my factory. The only way It will allow me to use accessor methods is to change </p>

<pre><code>function DataObject(data, valueBuilder) {}
return DataObject;
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>return { get gender(), set gender(val)};
</code></pre>

<p>which means I have no way to actually instantiate my factory with the data. I'm sure there must be some way to do this. What am I missing?</p>

<p>f(n) = O(g(n)) when there exists a constant c such that f(n) is always &lt;= c*g(n) for a some value of n > n0</p>

<p>This generally makes sense to me. We are only concerned with large enough values of n that the growth rates actually matter. But why multiply g(n) by c? It seem like I could choose a very large value for c, and make the whole thing arbitrary by blowing out the size of smaller g(n) values. </p>

<p>Secondary question: When choosing to classify an algorithm into a complexity class, is the general rule of thumb to just choose the lowest growth class that still holds according to the definition of Big O? According to the definition it seems valid to classify a constant time algorithm as O(n!), simply because f(n) will be &lt;= c*g(n). Off course this offers no value.  </p>

<p>I am switching the IDE to Eclipse Juno, I noticed that in eclipse templates are created differently. You have to go to preferences and create a template there.</p>

<p>I think also the syntax is different. what I have right now in my jtpl file is something like this: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;%-- tpl:insert attribute=""imports"" --%&gt;

&lt;%-- /tpl:insert --%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure if this will work with eclipse as is or not.</p>

<p>Rational was very good at managing templates. the second I add the import statement on the top of the jsp, rational inserts all the code from the templates for me (dimmed so I cannot change it in the jsp) and all I have to do is to fill the parts I need.</p>

<p>Also with Rational if I make one change to the template and save it, all the jsps using it are updated with the change.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>1) is there a way to use the current template without much changes when switching to eclipse?</p>

<p>2) this is very important too, is there a way to automatically update all the pages using a template when a change is made to it ?</p>

<p>3) any good examples of using, updating templates with eclipse?</p>

<p>On jsFiddle this code is there to close all menus when user resizes page. So my mobile and pc menu doesn't mess up while switching screens. The issue isn't that the menu closes when resizing a window and hiding menu content, but that after resizing the window, then clicking the menu causes to open and then closing the menu content. The content isn't staying open.</p>

<pre><code>$(window).resize(function () {
    // PC main menu items
    $(""#menu-content-1"").hide();
    $(""#menu-content-2"").hide();

So far it's going really well and I though I was almost there working purely on the localhost. Deployed it to nodejitsu and loaded the page up, but the server isn't sending the initial server data to the client. If (while the page is open, no refresh) I reset the server it then establishes connection and the whole thing works as expected, but a client visiting the server doesn't do it. </p>

<p>Server init code:</p>

<pre><code>    var express = require('express');
var app = require('express')()
  , server = require('http').createServer(app)
  , io = require('socket.io').listen(server);


server.listen(8080);

app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
app.get('/', function(req, res){

    res.sendfile(""index.html"");

});

app.get('/RTSwords', function(req, res){

    //res.sendfile(""public\\RTSwords.html"");
    res.sendfile(""RTSwords.html"");

});
</code></pre>

<p>Server socket.io code</p>

<pre><code>// define interactions with client
io.sockets.on('connection', function(socket){
    //send them board and first seven tiles.

    socket.emit('serverNews', {'game': JSON.stringify(gameBoard), 'newTiles': randomTileString(7)});
</code></pre>

<p>And client socket.io code</p>

<pre><code>var socket = io.connect('http://MYURLHERE');
.......
socket.on('serverNews', function(data){
            update(data);
        });
</code></pre>

<p>So yeah,in summary it works locally, works when page is loaded and server is restarted (I'm just ""jistu deploy""ing to do that) but not when server is running then page is loaded.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>An unhandled exception of type 'System.Net.Mail.SmtpException' occurred in System.dll Additional information: The operation has timed
  out.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what I have done is to find the server settings to which I want to send mails to. This is very popular in my country:</p>

<pre><code>Incoming settings

Protocol -&gt; POP
Email address -&gt; username@abv.bg
Username -&gt; username@abv.bg
Password -&gt; password
POP server -&gt; pop3.abv.bg
Security type -&gt; SSL
Server port -&gt; 995

Outgoing server settings

Username -&gt; username@abv.bg
Password -&gt; password
SMTP server -&gt; smtp.abv.bg
Security type -&gt; SSL
Server port -&gt; 465
</code></pre>

<p>then I created a <code>Console project</code> and in my main method I have this code:</p>

<pre><code>        SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient(""smtp.abv.bg"");
        client.Port = 465;
        client.EnableSsl = true;
        client.Timeout = 100000;
        client.DeliveryMethod = SmtpDeliveryMethod.Network;
        client.UseDefaultCredentials = false;
        client.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(
         ""username@abv.bg"", ""password"");

        MailMessage msg = new MailMessage();
        msg.To.Add(""username@abv.bg"");
        msg.From = new MailAddress(""username@abv.bg"");
        msg.Subject = ""Test subject"";
        msg.Body = ""Test test test..."";
        client.Send(msg);
</code></pre>

<p>Since I have no experience with this I just try the code as you see it. No additional settings anywhere. The only thing that I think should not be problem but I think worth mentioning that here:</p>

<pre><code>         client.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(
         ""username@abv.bg"", ""password"");
</code></pre>

<p>and here:</p>

<pre><code>         msg.To.Add(""username@abv.bg"");
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using the same e-mail. But I think this shouldn't be a problem. Any idea what am I doing wrong here?</p>

<p>Currently i am removing all ':' characters from the String, so for example ""11:23:23"" becomes ""112323"".</p>

<p>With the ""new"" String i can then convert it to a number representation for example:</p>

<p>int x = Integer.parseInt(""112323);</p>

<p>This will produce the integer value 112323.</p>

<p>Now, my problem is because it is a timer, sometimes the time represented in the String is quite low. If i had the time string ""00:00:01"" and removed the ':' characters it would produce the integer value 1.</p>

<p>This is because if am not mistaken, the integer value 000001 will be ""trimmed"" as the 0's do not change the value of the integer so the value 1 is returned.</p>

<p>Is there a way to specify that i want to display the full 6 digits regardless of the fact they maybe ""insignificant"" in terms of the number value?</p>

<p>my code:</p>

<pre><code>String timeTrimmed = pois.get(i).getTimeStamp().replaceAll("":"","""");
                int result = Integer.parseInt(timeTrimmed);

<p>is it possible to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>String timeTrimmed = pois.get(i).getTimeStamp().replaceAll("":"","""");
                int result = Integer.parseInt(######,timeTrimmed);
</code></pre>

<p>with the # representing the fact i want the integer to keep all the digits?</p>

<p>I hope you understand what i mean,</p>

They both have auto-incremented IDs, the only difference between the two is that they have different IDs for the same records.</p>

<p><strong>Among the columns, there is an IDENTIFIER column which is not unique</strong>, i.e. there are (very few) records with the same IDENTIFIER in both tables.</p>

<p>Now, in order to find a correspondence between the IDs of table A and the IDs of table B, <strong>I have to join these two tables</strong> (for all purposes it's a self-join) on the IDENTIFIER column, something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT A.ID, B.ID
FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.IDENTIFIER = B.IDENTIFIER
</code></pre>

<p><strong>But, being IDENTIFIER non-unique, this generates every possible combination of the repeating values of IDENTIFIER, I don't want that.</strong></p>

<p>Ideally, I would like to <strong>generate an one to one association between IDs that have repeating IDENTIFIER values</strong>, based on their order. For example, supposing that there are six records with different ID and the same IDENTIFIER value in table A (and thus in table B):</p>

<pre><code>A                                 B

IDENTIFIER:'ident105', ID:23  -&gt;  IDENTIFIER:'ident105', ID:420
IDENTIFIER:'ident105', ID:100 -&gt;  IDENTIFIER:'ident105', ID:512
IDENTIFIER:'ident105', ID:120 -&gt;  IDENTIFIER:'ident105', ID:513
IDENTIFIER:'ident105', ID:300 -&gt;  IDENTIFIER:'ident105', ID:798

<p>That would be ideal.
Anyway, a way to generate a one to one association regardless of the order of the IDs would still be ok (but not preferred).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>However when I check it, only the ext.list is displayed, no container above it. Note, I don't want a toolbar. There are also no errors in chrome.</p>

<p>Here is my dealerList card:</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> Here are the main config parameters for the list:</p>

<pre><code> flex:1,

"16310074","1","","","2013-04-30 22:35:56","","2","8089","<p>I am new to Python and working on a class for storing meaningful data pieces about books. I have started as follows:</p>

<pre><code> class BookDisplay: 

     def __init__(self, _name, _isbn, _price, _picture, _link):
      self.name =    _name
      self.isbn =    _isbn
      self.price =   _price
      self.picture = _picture
      self.link =    _link
      self.xmlString = MakeXMLString(_name, _isbn, _price, _picture, _link)                    

    name = """"
    isbn = """"
    price = 0.0
    picture = """"  #a URL
    link = """" 

    xmlString = """"
</code></pre>

<p>I thought this <code>__init__</code> method would just be able to call <code>MakeXMLString</code>, which I defined in the same file (bookdisplay.py), right below the <code>BookDisplay</code> class: </p>

<pre><code>  def MakeXMLString(_name, _isbn, _price, _picture, _link): #python multi-line syntax  
    xmlString = ""&lt;name&gt;"" + _name + ""&lt;/name&gt;"" \
                     + ""&lt;isbn&gt;"" + _isbn + ""&lt;/isbn&gt;"" \
                     + ""&lt;price&gt;"" + str(_price) + ""&lt;/price&gt;"" \
                     + ""&lt;picture&gt;"" + _picture + ""&lt;/picture&gt;"" \
                     + ""&lt;link&gt;"" + _link + ""&lt;/link&gt;"" 

    return xmlString 
</code></pre>

<p>Originally, I actually had <code>MakeXMLString</code> as a method within the class, like this:</p>

<pre><code> def MakeXMLString(self):  
    self.xmlString = ""&lt;name&gt;"" + self.name + ""&lt;/name&gt;"" \
                     + ""&lt;isbn&gt;"" + self.isbn + ""&lt;/isbn&gt;"" \
                     + ""&lt;price&gt;"" + str(self.price) + ""&lt;/price&gt;"" \
                     + ""&lt;picture&gt;"" + self.picture + ""&lt;/picture&gt;"" \
                     + ""&lt;link&gt;"" + self.link + ""&lt;/link&gt;"" 
</code></pre>

<p>In that case, <code>__init__</code> contained this call: </p>

<pre><code>self.xmlString = self.MakeXMLString()
</code></pre>

<p>In both cases, when trying to instantiate <code>BookDisplay</code> from another file:</p>

<pre><code>from bookdisplay import BookDisplay
...
...
thumbnails = []
...
thumbnails.append(BookDisplay(titleField, ""-1"", float(priceField), imgField, linkField))
</code></pre>

<p>...I get the following global name error (this traceback in particular for the not-within-class function):</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;

    self.xmlString = MakeXMLString(_name, _isbn, _price, _picture, _link)

</code></pre>

<p>What am I missing here? From what I can tell, <code>MakeXMLString</code> is perfectly accessible to the class. </p>

<p>If I can't then I can save these bytes to a file and have videoview play/read them even without metadata?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

  else {y &lt;- p + rexp(1, lambda)}

Unfortunately Facebook Login isn't the best way to log in to an app and our users want something different. So, we're trying to discuss a new way of logging into our app. We came up with a ""passwordless"" login solution which is basically a web-thing and not yet very common in smartphone apps.</p>

<p>One idea is to let the user enter his username and email on registration and save this to our web service. The user gets an email with his login credentials or a link with a token that identifies him within the app. The problem might be that email is the wrong medium for an app login confirmation.</p>

<p>A second idea is to generate a local token and use this as ""password"" which is synced across the users devices via e.g. iCloud. This way we have no clue if the user is actually ""real"".</p>

<p>Our third idea is a bit of a mix where the user only needs a password when he want's to login on an different device.</p>

<p>So, what do you think could be the best way to implement such a mechanism into a cross-platform smartphone app?</p>

<p>Have we completely missed something important?</p>

<p>I would appreciate productive suggestions.</p>

The way it works is that they login through the landing site and on there they choose which of the two sites to go to. All the sites have a machine key set. </p>

<p>I have the sites set as this way</p>

<ul>
<li>a.site.com - Landing page</li>
<li>b.site.com</li>
<li>c.site.com</li>
</ul>

<p>The .net 3.5 version of the app works, but I can not get the 4.5 version of the app to work. It logs me in on the landing page, but every time I go to site b or c, it redirects me back to the login page. I've checked the configurations in web config on all three apps and they are using the same machine key and form information. Here is the format config I am using. </p>

<pre><code>        &lt;machineKey validationKey=""ZZZ"" decryptionKey=""YYY"" validation=""SHA1"" decryption=""AES"" /&gt;

    &lt;authentication mode=""Forms""&gt;
        &lt;forms name="".FormName"" loginUrl=""http://a.site.com/login.htm"" defaultUrl=""default.aspx"" protection=""All"" timeout=""15"" path=""/"" requireSSL=""false"" slidingExpiration=""true"" enableCrossAppRedirects=""false"" cookieless=""UseDeviceProfile"" domain=""site.com"" /&gt;
    &lt;/authentication&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have read there are issues on this site with the machine key, but those seem to apply with different apps running different .net versions. The new apps I am using are running the same .net version and are hosted on Microsoft Server 2008. I am not sure what configuration/setting I'm missing that is causing this. Does anyone know what I could be doing wrong?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE :</strong></p>

<p>Here was the code i was using :</p>

<p>Dim MyGuid As Guid = Guid.NewGuid()</p>

<pre><code>            Dim sSSO_ID As String = Guests.AddSSOIDForDirectLogin(iGuestID, MyGuid.ToString)

            ' first write the authentication cookie to 
            ' the machine so we know the user is sSSO_ID
            'FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(sSSO_ID, False)

            Dim sPersistentCookie As Boolean = False

            Dim t As New FormsAuthenticationTicket(1, sSSO_ID, DateTime.Now, DateTime.Now.AddMonths(3), sPersistentCookie, sSSO_ID.ToString, FormsAuthentication.FormsCookiePath)
            Dim eTicket As String = FormsAuthentication.Encrypt(t)
            Dim c As New HttpCookie(FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName, eTicket)

            If sPersistentCookie = True Then
                c.Expires = DateTime.Now.AddMonths(3)
            End If


            Response.Cookies.Add(c)
</code></pre>

<p>Turns out I commented out SetAuthCookie of which set the domain. The forms authentication ticket I created was not setting the domain. Isn't SetAuthCookie similar to that of creating the forms authentication ticket, so would both be necessary? It would be simply just be adding c.Domain=""site.com"" before adding the cookie</p>

<p>But I am looking for something:</p>

<pre><code>// var allPeople = Ext.ComponentQuery.query('[name^=people_]');    // as we do jquery   
</code></pre>

<p>Or anything similar to it, which should work. Please clear what I am doing wrong in option[1,2,3] as most of the post says that using id[option 4] is bad. An how can we achieve using [name^=] ""which says any element starting with people_"". Is it possible in Ext? Is it possible through REGEX?(just for an idea)</p>

<p>Please add explanations for better understanding of selectors.</p>

<p>My setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>SQLite3 database, journal_mode=WAL, synchronous=NORMAL</li>
<li>Mulitple C++ processes (3 to be exact) use the database - Any method within these process open and close their own non-shared connection with <code>sqlite3_open_v2</code>.</li>
<li>Methods that are inserting data open the db in <code>SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE</code> mode</li>
<li>Methods that read from the database (i.e. only do select statements) open the db in <code>SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY</code> mode</li>

<p>In WAL mode I believe it should be possible to have concurrent readers whilst there is a write occuring.</p>

<p>Yet I am seeing ""database is locked"" when I am preparing a select statement using <code>sqlite3_prepare_v2</code></p>

<p>What would be best? To create a function <code>update_site(&lt;all the columns of table&gt;)</code> and a separate function <code>update_site(id integer, &lt;varchar column to update&gt;)</code>, or use the mode in one function to define the difference? Which option is more efficient? One unique function or different ones for each purpose?</p>

<pre><code>$('.sss').parent().parent().find(""&gt;div.childCollapsible&gt;div[data-onthemovecollapsible=true]"")
</code></pre>

<p>I can only use CSS selectors (this is part of Selenium thest). I expected to get only siblings of 'sss' however I am getting all the children of sub elements too.</p>

<p>How could I restrict it only to siblings?
or any other workaround that can get me from any element in the tree siblings only of any </p>

<pre><code>data-onthemovecollapsible=""true"" 
</code></pre>

<p>attribute holder.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Firstly I would like apologise for failing to express myself clearly. The structure that I am working with is 'infinite tree structure' that has unknown amount of nodes on each layer, mechanism I am looking for is ability to get siblings on the same level that I am starting search from is and only children of his parent (his brothers + himself). All levels of tree have identical HTML syntax, so looking at them relatively from element one starts from, each layer is identical, hence the CSS selector should be identical too. I cannot use any other Jquery method but 'find', and only can use CSS selectors, as mechanism is part of selenium test so only By.CssSelector(""..."") can be used. I can traverse up the elements by using element.FindElements(By.XPath("".."")) that gets me parent as I know how many levels up parent is, but from parent position I need to get all siblings without children (that have identical html syntax) in one go, so i would assume selector with only certain layer should do (like one in jsfiddle below), however it selects all the children nodes too - does not respect '>' for some reason. This would do nicely if I could use all JQuery functions.</p>

<pre><code>$('.sss').parent().parent().children().children()
</code></pre>

<p>what I need is same result but with CSS selector.</p>

"3153902","1","","","2010-06-30 22:33:14","","14","2627","<p>I need some help figuring out whether it'd be a good idea to use a CMS or portal solution for my latest project, which is (currently) an ASP.NET MVC application that must serve multiple customers (being a company or some other entity with a list of users) from a single installation (that is, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service"" rel=""nofollow"">SaaS</a> solution).</p>

<p>In addition to the core functionality, which includes document management/publishing, I also need to provide basic social features (such as blog, forum, gallery, polls, etc.). However, it is imperative that content is only visible for the customer to which it belongs, and my evaluation of a bunch of CMS and portal solutions has shed little light on whether they support this. They're pretty focused on single-user installations, and documentation on how to integrate with an existing MVC solution is pretty thin.</p>

<p>Essentially I'm looking for some guidance to help me discard dead-end options (the product does not meet requirements, imposes too many restrictions, is not mature, etc.) and find unexplored options before getting too far ahead with the project.</p>

<p>My requirements for the architecture include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multi-site support (using a single domain for hosting)
<ul>
<li>Watertight separation of content between customers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Full integration across components/features
<ul>
<li>SSO (single-sign-on)</li>
<li>Single-site experience (shared header/footer, unified navigation, unified tags, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ease of development and deployment
<ul>
<li>Custom logic will be written using C# and ASP.NET MVC and any products should support this</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I want to stay in control
<ul>
<li>Solution should offer features but otherwise stay out of the way (for example, not force stupid idioms on me, like insisting on GUIDs for primary keys)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Active development community
<ul>
<li>No single-man efforts</li>
<li>Recent source control activity</li>
<li>Reasonable levels of documentation and maturity</li>
<li>Does not have to be open source</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I have spent a fair amount of time evaluating products and components, which I'll briefly share here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbraco"" rel=""nofollow"">Umbraco</a>
<ul>
<li>Does not support ASP.NET MVC (yet, as someone is bound to otherwise comment)</li>
<li>Great community support, active development</li>
<li>Seems to be lots of work to get started</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href=""http://kooboo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Kooboo</a>
<ul>
<li>No source activity (no updates for almost two months)</li>
<li>GPL licensed? (need something that allows for closed source applications)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href=""http://n2cms.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">N2CMS</a>
<ul>
<li>Partial ASP.NET MVC support</li>
<li>Every customer must have a separate domain</li>
<li>Limited source activity (not dead but not vibrant either)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchard_Project"" rel=""nofollow"">Orchard</a>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft-sponsored (which means it's likely to be over-architected, code-bloated and slow, although it does have some well known and respected contributors/leads)</li>
<li>Built using ASP.NET MVC</li>
<li>Looks promising feature-wise (but is unlikely to be stable at this stage)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href=""http://atomsite.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">AtomSite</a>
<ul>
<li>Feels reasonably mature and has decent documentation, albeit with holes</li>
<li>Built using ASP.NET MVC</li>
<li>Limited source activity, single developer</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MojoPortal"" rel=""nofollow"">MojoPortal</a>
<ul>
<li>Looks good for a portal, but probably requires custom logic to be built as modules around the product (I was hoping to avoid that kind of lock-in if possible)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DotNetNuke"" rel=""nofollow"">DotNetNuke</a> (DNN), <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telligent_Community"" rel=""nofollow"">CommunityServer</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SharePoint"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft Office SharePoint Server</a> (MOSS)
<ul>
<li>Definitely not my cup of tea ;)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">BlogEngine.NET</a>
<ul>
<li>Mature and feature-complete</li>
<li>No ASP.NET MVC support</li>
<li>Integration possible but not without lots of Web.config voodoo</li>
<li>Not sure if it supports customer separation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Given the list above I'm leaning towards AtomSite, N2CMS, Orchard or BlogEngine.NET. If I go with the latter I'll be using jitbit AspNetForum, which is a great match for my needs.</p>

<p>I'd probably prefer to use a custom ASP.NET MVC solution and individual components as this is likely to give me the greatest amount of control, but on the other hand, it'll make site theming and integration harder. What combinations have you tried, what worked well and what didn't? Anything important I'm leaving out of my evaluation? Any other relevant advice?</p>

<p>I'd appreciate it if the answers were not simply endorsements of your favorite product or way of doing things, but something that would help me choose or eliminate solution candidates given the requirements outlined above.</p>

<p>I opened the entire solution with all libraries and test executables and built the entire solution without errors. I modified the fields (token id, cert file, ...) in the Program.cs in JdSoft.Apple.Apns.Notifications.Test to meet my specs.
After a few tries I managed to get my certificate file OK and the connection to Apple servers is now up. I see the message saying I'm connected in the output of the application.</p>

<p>Probleme comes now. Everytime the application tries to send a message to Apple I get the error ""A Type load exception has occured"". I tried a little debug and the error seems to come from the NotificationPayload constructor. </p>

<p>Doing step by step follow up, it appears the NotificationAlert is correctly instantiated inside the NotificationPayload constructor. The error appears when coming back to the Notification constructor where the Payload member appears in the debugger as ""A type load exception has occurred."" instead of an object.</p>

<p>From there the Notification object ends up with the same behavior.</p>

<p>From my research on the Internet this could come from the version of Newtonsoft.Json.Compact.dll but I have no idea what to do with this piece of information.</p>

<p>For information I can see the same error when running the compiled test on my CentOS server.</p>

<p>First, this is what I've done.</p>

<p>In Eclipse, I right-clicked my project that I'd like to create a test project for.
I selected AndroidTools -> New Test Project
I filled out the necessary information selecting a location of ../MyApp/tests for the new project and selected MyApp as the project to test.  Everything else was left as default.</p>

<p>While this was executing I received the below as an error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[2011-04-01 08:13:02 - WPMSTest] R.java was modified manually! Reverting to generated version!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But everything seemed okay.  I had a new source tree in my tests folder.</p>

<p>So I tried to execute it (first on hardware, then on the emulator) by RunAs -> Android jUnit test.</p>

<p>In both runs I received the below in my eclipse console:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[2011-04-01 08:23:04 - WPMSTest] Launching instrumentation android.test.InstrumentationTestRunner on device emulator-5554<br/>[2011-04-01 08:23:04 - WPMSTest] Failed to launch test</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My two manifest files:</p>

<p>WPMSTest:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;

<pre><code>(gdb) print test

<p>I now wonder if I use the new GtkStyleContext in a wrong way, or whether or the theme is broken. How can I narrow down the source of the problem?</p>

<p>I'd also appreciate it if someone can point my to a good introduction to GtkStyleContext. The official API documentation is not so helpful for understanding the fundamental concept.</p>

<p>The problem is: For some bitfield base classes, an uint8_t is not sufficient. BitfieldSmall does fit into a uint8_t, but BitfieldLarge does not. The data needs to be packed as tightly as possible (it will be handled by SSE instructions later), so always using uint16_t is out of question. Is there a way to declare the ""all"" field with an integral type, whose size is the same as the bitfield? Or another way to access bits as a whole?</p>

<p>I can of course forego the use of the template and declare every kind of bitfield explicitly, but I would like to avoid code repetition (there is quite a list of operators und member functions).</p>

<p>For example, if I want to make Apple class a picture(MovieClip) that can be dragged, create any number of apples, up to a million, I can't possibly add <em>apples[0].addEventListener, apples[1].addEventListener ... apples[1000000].addEventListener</em> to the code. <strong>How do I make it global?</strong></p>

<p>I'm asking cause when I'm directly coding for a specific instance, it has a name and I know exactly what am I addressing. And working with a class and making many objects I kinda don't... Sorry, I'm green</p>

<pre><code>var app = angular.module('ngMatch', []);
    app.directive('match', function () {
        return {
            require: 'ngModel',
            restrict: 'A',

                scope.$watch(function() {
                    var modelValue = ctrl.$modelValue || ctrl.$$invalidModelValue;
                    return (ctrl.$pristine &amp;&amp; angular.isUndefined(modelValue)) || scope.match === modelValue;

                });
            }
        };
    });
</code></pre>

<p>But addition of ui.bootstrap for tooltips on input:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id=""password"" type=""password""
                   tooltip=""Your password should contain at least one digit, one capital and special symbol, should have the length from 8 to 20 symbols""
                   tooltip-trigger=""focus""
                   tooltip-placement=""top""

&lt;input id=""confirm-password"" type=""password"" class=""form-control"" name=""confirm_password"" value="""" placeholder=""Confirm Password"" ng-model=""confirm_password"" data-match=""password"" required&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Results in scope.match become ""undefined"".
Already tried to rename the directive from ""match"" to something different, but this didn't work.
Also found the following issue: <a href=""https://github.com/interval-braining/angular-input-match/issues/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/interval-braining/angular-input-match/issues/1</a>, which corresponds to my issue but not showing any errors.</p>

<p>I'd also like to clarify: The issue shows up ONLY when we add 'ui.bootstrap' to the list of dependencies: </p>

<pre><code>angular.module('ModuleName', [
        'ui.router',
        ...
        'vcRecaptcha',
        'ui.bootstrap'
    ])
</code></pre>

<p>And it doesn't matter whether we actually use it or not, but when it's added we're getting some other 'scope' (without 'match' variable) for unknown reason.</p>

<p>What we can do to make our scopes even more isolated?
Any help is appreciated, I have spent more than 7 hours, trying to resolve this conflict...</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/7nlvp.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Which is fine. (Here i've entered the formula for the part of the sRGB color space gamma conversion)</p>

<p>But now i don't seem to be able to <em>do</em> anything with it.</p>

<p>There is an <strong>Insert</strong> button. i would assume that clicking <strong>Insert</strong> would insert it into the application that is active behind it (much like the On-Screen Keyboard works):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/jY1XX.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Except i assume it would operate as a Paste operation.</p>

<p>i can find no information in the help on what is required by an application to make it work. There is no mention of any special API some software must support. </p>

<p>Nor can i find any information on MSDN about what special API is required to accept the insertion of an equation.</p>

<p>What API, registration, callback, listener, message, COM Object do i have to implement so that i will receive MathPanel input?</p>

<p>The only reason i mention <strong>MathML</strong> is because an answer on <a href=""http://superuser.com/a/42146/8169"">SuperUser mentioned MathML</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Theoretically, any app that supports <strong>MathML</strong> (Mathematical Markup Language) can be used with the Windows 7 Math Input Panel. The Math Input Panel <strong>only works</strong> with programs that support MathML. Here are a few such apps: StarOffice, OpenOffice, Opera and Maple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well how do i make <em>my</em> program support MathML?</p>

<p>As far as i know MathML is a markup language; not a Windows API. It would be like saying, ""How do i make my program support HTML?"" Html is text, and you can paste it anywhere.</p>

<p>MathPad refuses to paste unless i ""support"" MathML?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Inspecting the <code>IDataObject</code> on the clipboard after clicking <strong>Insert</strong>, i see two formats available (neither of which are text, which explains why i do not get any markup):</p>

<p>Format 1: </p>

<pre><code>     CLIPFORMAT cfFormat: ""MathML Presentation"" (49839)
PDVTargetDevice ptd:      0x00000000
          DWORD dwAspect: DVASPECT_CONTENT
          DWORD lindex:   -1
          DWORD tymed:    1  (TYMED_HGLOBAL)
</code></pre>

<p>Format 2: </p>

<pre><code>     CLIPFORMAT cfFormat:""MathML"" (49838)
PDVTargetDevice ptd:      0x00000000
          DWORD dwAspect: DVASPECT_CONTENT
          DWORD lindex:   -1
          DWORD tymed:    1  (TYMED_HGLOBAL)
</code></pre>

<p>So at least now i have some clipboard formats:</p>

<ul>
<li>""MathML Presentation""</li>
<li>""MathML""</li>
</ul>

<p>i still cannot find anything on MSDN about either clipboard format.</p>

<p>I finally managed to make the code work on web on jsfiddle or in the ripple emulator but when I try to test it on the device it's all messed up. No pulsating effect appears or it appears but not in 0.5s interval as mentioned in the css or it flickers randomly or it fades out but not fully, just half of it....its like the effect happens but very fast or in contradiction to a similar effect... But I tried removing all the content from that page and still no luck...</p>

<p>Is it possible to make it work also on the mobile device? </p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>It's something with the pulsating effect because I tried to add the pulsating effect to all the elements on the page: the progress bar, the frame div, and to the 3 buttons and to the slider and the effect was very interesting: The frame, the <code>progressBar</code> and 2 of those 3 buttons were not really pulsating, just flickering. The other button wasn't doing anything, not even flickering, and the slider from the bottom was pulsating correctly (from 0 to 100% opacity and with 500ms delay).. What's the thing here? Why aren't other divs pulsating? Has it something with the position (fixed, absolute, relative)?? Is there a way to fix this or it's a bug? This all happens on the phone. On fiddle or on ripple emulator it works as it should! Why?</p>

<p>Could somebody please take a look at it... I'm having this problem for a few days so far and I cannot pass it. 
Thank you very much!</p>

"6754390","1","6759190","","2011-07-19 21:27:06","","2","61","<p>I have defined some complex data types, for instance:</p>

<pre><code>type drawer =
  { ...
    box: boxes list }
type table =
  { ...
    drawers: drawer list }
type room =
  { ...
    tables: table list }
</code></pre>

<p>And I want to define some functions of similar purposes but with different types of arguments, for exemple:</p>

<pre><code>val compare_size_rooms: room -&gt; room -&gt; bool (* true: bigger, false: smaller *)
val compare_size_tables: table -&gt; table -&gt; bool
val compare_size_boxes: box -&gt; box -&gt; bool
</code></pre>

<p>One thing is that sometimes, due to different structures, 2 rooms/tables/boxes may be not comparable, therefore I hope the comparison could give me some extra information, besides just true or false.</p>

<p>My question is, whether it is a common way to define a type <code>info</code>:</p>

<pre><code>type info =
  | Incomparable_Tables_One_foldable_Another_non_foldable
  | Incomparable_Tables_One_rectangle_Another_triangle
  | Incomparable_Boxes_One_in_paper_Another_in_metal
  | ...
</code></pre>

<p>And I make the functions as following:</p>

<pre><code>val compare_size_rooms: room -&gt; room -&gt; bool * info (* true: bigger, false: smaller *)
val compare_size_tables: table -&gt; table -&gt; bool * info
val compare_size_boxes: box -&gt; box -&gt; bool * info
</code></pre>

<p>So that in those functions, I analyse 2 values, if they are comparable, the <code>bool</code> returns which is bigger or smaller, otherwise, <code>info</code> returns useful information of analysis.</p>

<p>This structure seems me not very common, could anyone tell me if it is usual, or to realize the same thing if there is a better way?</p>

<p>Thank you very much</p>

I was thinking of using any memoization technique but unable to figure out as shortest path may change altogether if particular edge is removed from graph.<br>

The script will be applied on a Windows 2008 R2 server.
Original statement
reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa"" /v RestrictAnonymous /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f</p>

<p>What I want to accomplish before applying this script is:
1. Query each key to check if key exists with the correct data
2. If key and correct data exists, no action needed
3. If key nor data exists, redirect output to file
  a. I would like for the result to be displayed along with the registry key                          that does not match
The redirected output for the non-matching registry keys will be the ones I will manually review.</p>

<p>The following represents my attemps to derive the data I am requesting. I have applied many different switches (/f /d | (pipe) with findstr) and redirections in many different ways all with no luck. I also reviewed the reg compare command but it is not applicable because I am not using another client to compare the registry against. For some reason, I cannot get any combinations of switches and commands to work as desired. If I get the desired output, the findstr is not validating correctly. Or, if the findstr validates correctly, the output does not show. The findstr results seems to be the logical statement but the results are not validating correctly ex. >> C:\Users\AIODUDE\Documents\results.csv reg query ""HKLM\Software_reg_test"" /v STIG_test | findstr /E ""0""
if %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 echo I match >> C:\Users\AIODUDE\Documents\results.csv
if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 echo No match >> C:\Users\AIODUDE\Documents\results2.csv</p>

<p>Remember, this script has about 200-300 registry add statements.</p>

<pre><code>::all reg add keys are only set to do not read during testing
::reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa"" /v RestrictAnonymous /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

reg query ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa"" /v RestrictAnonymous &gt; D:\results.csv
if %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 echo I match &gt;&gt; D:\results.csv
if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 echo No match &gt;&gt; D:\results.csv


::reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EventLog\Setup"" /v MaxSize /t REG_DWORD /d 32768 /f

reg query ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EventLog\Setup"" /v MaxSize &gt;&gt; D:\results.csv
if %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 echo I match &gt;&gt; D:\results.csv
if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 echo No match &gt;&gt; D:\results.csv


::reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer"" /v AlwaysInstallElevated /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

reg query ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer"" /v AlwaysInstallElevated &gt;&gt; D:\results.csv
if %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 echo I match &gt;&gt; D:\results.csv
if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 echo No match &gt;&gt; D:\results.csv

<p>Endoro--I answered here because of the comments limitation.
Your statement gives me most of the data I need thus far--thanks for that!. I have tried dozens of various constructs! The findstr matches the exact data that I need. The below examples work with the exception of redirecting the output if the key is not found. I decided to use set statements to make editing the hundreds of lines a lot easier:</p>

<pre><code>set _results=C:\Users\AIODUDE\Documents\xresultsd.txt

set _NEQ=%_results% 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; echo success || echo FAIL &gt;&gt; %_results%

set _EQU=%_results% 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; echo success || echo FAIL &gt;&gt; %_results%
</code></pre>

<p><em><strong>THIS EXAMPLE IS GOOD</em></strong> If it matches, the output states (I match--so this key is good and no further action).</p>

<pre><code>reg query ""HKLM\Software\_reg_test"" /f STIG_test /e &gt;&gt;%_results%
reg query ""HKLM\Software\_reg_test"" /v STIG_test | findstr ""0""
if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 echo No match &gt;&gt;%_NEQ%
if %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 echo I match &gt;&gt;%_EQU%
</code></pre>

<p><em><strong>THIS EXAMPLE HAS A NON-MATCHING DATA VLAUE</em></strong> Action is needed.</p>

<pre><code>REG Query ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa"" /f RestrictAnonymous /e &gt;&gt;%_results%
reg query ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa"" /v RestrictAnonymous | findstr ""1""
if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 echo No match &gt;&gt;%_NEQ%
if %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 echo I match &gt;&gt;%_EQU%
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the first reg query statement searches only the specific key and prints out the key and data value.  However, it does not ID what the correct value should be hence...
The second reg query statement does ID the correct value but does not print out what that value should be (this statement will need action--in this case this case data value should be 0.</p>

<p><em><strong>THIS EXAMPLE REGISTRY KEY IS NOT FOUND</em></strong> Action is needed.</p>

<pre><code>reg query ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa"" /f LmCompatibilityLevel /e &gt;&gt;%_results%
reg query ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa"" /v LmCompatibilityLevel | findstr ""5""
if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 echo No match &gt;&gt;%_NEQ%
if %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 echo I match &gt;&gt;%_EQU%
</code></pre>

<p>So the findstr (shows me the specific data I need to add or modify), if it could print from all statements would be the ideal and limit my search and editing to only the value data that does not match and if the key is not already present.</p>

This may seem really silly but I don't know what I'm missing!!! I am quite new to Java and have had a look at other examples on stack but to no avail :s I need to declare 3 interfaces. Each interface needs to declare a method with the same name as its interface. Then the abstract class is extended by 3 classes which implement the aforementioned interfaces.Each class needs to be instantiated. If anyone could explain the procedure to this I would be eternally grateful.</p>

As we know, homography matrix is define as H=A.[R t] , where A is the intrinsic camera matrix, R is rotation matrix and t is translation vector.
I want to estimate the view side of camera using pictures, also the orientation of camera in 3d room.</p>

<p>Homography matrix can I estimate with opencv function: findHomography, and I think it works!!!
Here how I do it:</p>

<pre><code>static Mat mFindHomography(MatOfKeyPoint keypoints1, MatOfKeyPoint keypoints2, MatOfDMatch matches){
    List&lt;Point&gt; lp1 = new ArrayList&lt;Point&gt;(500);
    List&lt;Point&gt; lp2 = new ArrayList&lt;Point&gt;(500);

    KeyPoint[] k1 = keypoints1.toArray();
    KeyPoint[] k2 = keypoints2.toArray();

    List&lt;DMatch&gt; matchesList = matches.toList();

    if (matchesList.size() &lt; 4){
        MatOfDMatch mat = new MatOfDMatch();
        return mat;
    }

    // Add matches keypoints to new list to apply homography
    for(DMatch match : matchesList){
        Point kk1 = k1[match.queryIdx].pt;
        Point kk2 = k2[match.trainIdx].pt;
        lp1.add(kk1);
        lp2.add(kk2);
    }

    MatOfPoint2f srcPoints = new MatOfPoint2f(lp1.toArray(new Point[0]));
    MatOfPoint2f dstPoints  = new MatOfPoint2f(lp2.toArray(new Point[0]));

    Mat mask = new Mat();

    Mat homography = Calib3d.findHomography(srcPoints, dstPoints, Calib3d.RANSAC, 10, mask); // Finds a perspective transformation between two planes. ---Calib3d.LMEDS Least-Median robust method 

    List&lt;DMatch&gt; matches_homo = new ArrayList&lt;DMatch&gt;();
    int size = (int) mask.size().height;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++){          
        if ( mask.get(i, 0)[0] == 1){
            DMatch d = matchesList.get(i);
            matches_homo.add(d);
        }
    }

    MatOfDMatch mat = new MatOfDMatch();
    mat.fromList(matches_homo);

    matchesFilterdByRansac = (int) mat.size().height;
    return homography;
}
</code></pre>

<p>After that, I want to decompose this homography matrix and compute euler angles. As we know H=A.[R t], I multiply homography matrix with inverse of camera intrinsic matrix:  H.A^{-1} = [R t]. So, I want to decompose [R t] in rotation and translation and compute euler angles from rotation matrix. But it didn't work. What is wrong there?!!</p>

<p>Note that opencv 3.0 has a homogeraphy decomposition function (<a href=""http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/calib3d/doc/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html#decomposehomographymat"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>), but I'm using opencv 2.4.4 for android!!! Is there a wrapper for it in java? </p>

<p>Second problem is with decomposing of rotation matrix in euler angels. Is there any problem with:</p>

<pre><code>    float[] eulerOrientation = new float[3];
SensorManager.getOrientation(rotationMatrix, eulerOrientation); 
</code></pre>

<p>I used this <a href=""http://nghiaho.com/?page_id=846"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a> too, but not better result!</p>

<pre><code>double pitch = Math.atan2(pose.get(2, 1)[0], pose.get(2, 2)[0]);
double roll = Math.atan2(-1*pose.get(2, 0)[0], Math.sqrt( Math.pow(pose.get(2, 1)[0], 2) + Math.pow(pose.get(2, 2)[0], 2)) );
double yaw = Math.atan2(pose.get(1, 0)[0], pose.get(0, 0)[0]);

<p>1) I want to have a double stop criterium that either leaves a fixed number of features or leaves fewer features than that fixed number if the those features still explain a fixed portion of the model, I do not want to cut the least significant feature and then have to run ridge regression again (I think lasso could help here but I don't want multiple small features to be thrown out automatically, like lasso does)</p>

<p>2) ridge regression requires a penalty parameter, which introduces subjectivity into the algorithm.</p>

<p>So I thought about stepwise regression which should be lighter in a computational sense and doesn't need spooky parameters. The only problem is that stepwise regression is said to be unable to deal with correlation between features, introducing errors when there are correlated features (which, from the context of the problem I'm working on, I expect there to be). I fully understand how such errors can come about using forward stepwise regression but I'm not sure what happens with backward stepwise regression. </p>

<p>Since you start out with all p features how could the algorithm, during the first iteration, ever choose to remove a feature that is strongly correlated with another feature (all other p-1 features are present so the correlation effect will always be felt by the algorithm)? And if it doesn't remove such a feature wouldn't that mean the next set, with p-1 features is the best possible p-1 set there is, and then using induction wouldn't the same thing hold for the next iteration and the one after that, and so on? What am I missing here?</p>

<p>P.S. I know backward stepwise regression has a flaw in that it always requires more obervations than features, but that condition is always met in the problem I'm working on.</p>

He said that our first goal should crash the server (assuming that server will get up in 1 min), we can sync our generator with server and then rand (timestamp) generated by the webserver could be same with our generator.</p>

<p>I am confuse, if we have a function rand (timestamp) would not it be depend on system timestamp or on server ""up time"" stamp?</p>

<p>P.S:
Asking a general question - its not dependent if it is in JAVA/PHP/ASP. Just asking how webserver/compiler work for such code?</p>

<p>The class in question currently takes four parameters in the constructor, each representing an algorithm.</p>

<p>How using Ninject (or a generalised approach) could I still use IOC but use the strategy pattern?</p>

<p>The current limitation is that my kernel (container) is aware of each algorithm interface, but that can only be bound to one concrete class. The only way around this I can see at the moment is pass in all eight algorithms at construction, but use different interfaces, but this seems totally uncessary. I wouldn't do this if I was not using an IOC container, so there must be some way around this.</p>

<p>Code example:</p>

<pre><code>class MyModule : NinjectModule 
{
    public override void Load() 
    {
        Bind&lt;Person&gt;().ToSelf();
        Bind&lt;IAlgorithm&gt;().To&lt;TestAlgorithm&gt;();
        Bind&lt;IAlgorithm&gt;().To&lt;ProductionAlgorithm&gt;();
    }
}

<p>Person needs to make use of both algorithms so I can switch at run time. But only TestAlgorithm is bound, as it's the first one in the container.</p>

<p>In English, each product is made up of several items of different quantities. These items are grouped by item code and are packs into smallpacks. These smallpacks are shipped together as a unit product. There are many different products. A single item can be used in different product.</p>

<p>I now have a list of products and the quantity required for each for shipment. I want a LINQ statement to consolidate a flat list of items and their quantities.</p>

<p>I have gotten this far, but it looks like it does not work:</p>

<pre><code>var packsQuery = from product in Products
                 from smallpack in product.ItemPacks
                 select new {Item = smallpack.Item, Quantity = smallpack.Quantity * product.Quantity};

foreach (var pack in packsQuery)
{
    consolidated.Add(pack.Item.ItemCode, new ItemPack(pack.Item, pack.Quantity));
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I group first, then I cannot select item for its quantity. If I select first, then I lose the grouping. Chicken and egg story?</p>

<p>EDIT:
Useful note: smallpack is of type ItemPack which looks like this</p>

<pre><code>public class ItemPack
{
     Item { get; } // The item in this pack, which *must* be a shared reference across all objects that uses this Item. So that change in Item properties are updated everywhere it is used. e.g. Price.
     ItemCode { get; } // The item code
     Quantity { get; } // The number of such Item in this pack.

The intention is to create a desktop/tablet UI and a separate mobile UI for the app, backend functionality would be implemented in Java. In principle, the components are mostly there; HTML5 offline seems to have wide support and works well while Web SQL has enough support (Chrome, Opera, iPhone &amp; Android) that we could work with it for offline storage. </p>

<p>As regards creating the UI, it would be nice to use some of the nice JSF libraries out there (Primefaces looks quite nice for example although I've never used it in production). So far, I can't think of any way (and I can't see anything mentioned) of using either HTML5 offline or web SQL in a JSF app. Has this been tried? Is there any methodology/framework that might help here? </p>

<p>I'm also not averse to using client side frameworks. I was very impressed by Dojo for example but then found that it didn't render well on Android with webkit so that ruled it out of use for the tablet scenario. I can probably make jQuery work but I find it to be very fragmented (for example, getting an accordion to handle resizing inside a layout frame just put me off). Finally, I looked at GWT; I wasn't keen on the complexity of getting offline to work and the support for web sql seemed to be a work in progress (no slight intended to the developers, it just seemed to be at an early stage). </p>

<p>So, given the requirement for a web app that runs on desktop/tablet (android) and also on mobile (Android &amp; iPhone) and which handles offline, how would you approach things? </p>

<p>The styles defined are this:</p>

<pre><code>a.transition {

One issue I am having is how to make my static helpers work again. Simplified my code looked like that</p>

<pre><code>// FooService.h
class FooService {
public:
    Foo* getSomeFoo(int x);
}

// BarUtils.h
class BarUtils {
public:
    static double calcSomething(int x, int a, int b);
}

// BarUtils.cpp
extern FooService* fooService;

double BarUtils::calcSomething(int x, int a, int b) {
    // need a Foo, so I call the globally available service
    Foo* foo = fooService-&gt;getSomeFoo(x);
    return doMagic(foo, a, b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>With wallaroo <code>fooService</code> no longer is global. How can I get it into the <code>BarUtils</code>? <code>BarUtils</code> is never being instanciated but has only static methods.</p>

<p>I am trying to give <code>calcSomething()</code> the <code>FooService</code> as a parameter but I'm failing because the <code>Collaborator</code> cannot be cast to a normal pointer.</p>

<p>If I pass the parameter the <code>Collaborator</code> itself it would be problematic in case I already have a normal pointer to something. I saw this case when in a service. There the pointer I would have to pass is the <code>this</code> pointer and I cannot cast it to a <code>Collaborator</code>.<br>
Having the caller to get the <code>Foo</code> and give it to <code>calcSomething()</code> would also not be an option because the logic to get the object is not always that easy and would duplicate logic.</p>

<p>Has anyone experience in wallaroo how to do this?</p>

<p>This happened to me before with the above version, when my various websites inside <em>htdocs</em> folder would pull a particular website's CSS file. When checked as 'Live View' I could locate all the external .css and .js files, but there was no way of finding out the location of these files and HOW it was pulled as dependent files.</p>

<p>This all happened, probably by accident, when I was setting up the 'Manage Sites' and its Server so the site could be viewed on localhost.  </p>

<p>1- Make sure, when you set up your 'Local Site Folder' address, do NOT leave your path on htdocs, but choose the website folder you are working on.</p>

<p>2- Even if by accident you have left your path as 'htdocs' once, what it does is create a copy of your website inside htdocs.  Meaning, while you still work with files inside your website folder, it pulls .css and .js files from htdocs level as well.  If you left your path as XAMPP, it will create those copied website folders on XAMPP level, and will keep pulling those older versions together with your updated files and drive you bonkers.</p>

<p>Not sure if I am clear about this problem with the above Dreamweaver version, but it cost me a delayed start on a customer's website.  I lost 3 days plus an amount of frustration and a gazillion testings. Unfortunately, I had not kept notes on how I resolved it before.  I couldn't find anywhere on the internet a similar post.</p>

<p>I'm trying to use user-defined methods for the first time and (as you can see) I'm having some trouble.</p>

<p>The assignment:
Write a java class with the following two user-defined methods:
Write a value-returning method named isVowel, that returns the boolean value true if a given character is a vowel, and otherwise returns the boolean value false.
Write a value-returning method named reverseDigit, that takes an int (integer) as a parameter and returns the number with its digits reversed. For example, calling reverseDigit(12345) returns the int value of 54321.
Write the main method for this class to test the above two user-defined methods.
Some things to think about:
What is the data type of the parameter passed to the isVowel method?
The isVowel method needs some conditional logic to make this decision, first pass at implementing this might be to write to test for an explicit vowel.
For the reverseDigit method, there's a couple of different ways you might want to think about doing this. One might be to convert the passed int value to a String first and then build the reverse of that String which can then be converted to an int. Look at Integer and String class API. Another means to do this could be using a purely mathematical approach.</p>

<p>Any tips or assistance in getting these methods to work and compile would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Background: I have one repository which contains three independent applications. It didn't start out this way. There was originally just one app in the repo. Over time, however, business needs have changed. One app became two (a legacy version and a re-write.) A web service was added. Separate branches were used to contain the three projects. However, they don't share any code. And so it'd be simpler to have them split out into their own repos.</p>

For example if a person is facing 270 and their compass is 280 there are 10 degrees between those 2 points.  I'd also like a negative number if it's to the left and positive to the right, relative to the 1st heading.</p>

<p>The problem comes when the to headings are 350 and 020 for example.  These two points are 30 degrees apart but would give a result of -330.</p>

<p>Below is an example of my code:</p>

<pre><code>function ConvertToRadians(_var)

function ConvertToDegrees(_var)

<pre><code>import Control.Monad
import Control.Monad.Error

newtype FSM m = FSM { unFSM :: String -&gt; m (String, FSM m) } 

fsm f []     = return []
fsm f (r:rs) = do
    (xs, f') &lt;- unFSM f r  
    liftM (xs:) (fsm f' rs) 
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this compiles fine:</p>

<pre><code>exclaim :: (Monad m) =&gt; FSM m
exclaim = FSM exclaim'
exclaim' xs = return (xs ++ ""!"", exclaim)
</code></pre>

<p>But this doesn't, because of the type declaration:</p>

<pre><code>question :: (MonadError String m) =&gt; FSM m
question = FSM question'
question' xs 
    | last xs == '?' = throwError ""Already a question""
    | otherwise      = return (xs ++ ""?"", question)
</code></pre>

<p>The error is <code>Non type-variable argument</code>, which I think is referring to the <code>String</code> after <code>MonadError</code>. If I remove the type declaration, I get <code>Could not deduce</code> instead. I understand enabling FlexibleContexts just ""fixes"" this but is there something simpler I could be doing to allow me to throw errors? I'd rather not be enabling all sorts of compiler extensions.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that the popovers do not fire when the trigger button is inside the template from the directive, but they work fine if the button is outside of the directive as illustrated in the Plunk below. </p>

<p>I was just wondering if these values are always correct, as in, if you have a column with 500k rows with value 1, 500k rows with value of 5 and 1 row with a value of 1000, the LOW_VALUE should be 1 (after you convert the raw figure) and HIGH_VALUE should be 1000 (after you convert the raw figure). However, are there any circumstances where Oracle would 'miss' this outlier value and instead have 5 for HIGH_VALUE?</p>

<p>Also, what is the purpose of these 2 values? </p>

<p>When in run time, everything works ok. But when I change the property value in VS2010 designer there are some problems. When I completely remove value or insert it instead of empty VS' designer successfully refreshes display of my control. But when I add or remove collection items one at a time there's no change. When I build project the display updates (in fact, the designer reloads).</p>

<p>When I looked under debugger I saw that when in design mode it successfully calls my callback function when the collection is totally removed or inserted but does not fire <code>CollectionChanges</code> event when it is changed partially.</p>

<p>How should I force VS designer to track collection changes and fire events?</p>

<p>Another option is tp use ""Aspect fill"" mode, but it doesn't show the whole picture:</p>

However, when I actually try to call something like</p>

<pre><code>notifyItemChanged(0, new Object())
</code></pre>

<p>Android Studio informs me that I have an extra argument - it wants me to use just <code>notifyItemChanged(0)</code>. And looking at the <a href=""https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/refs/heads/master/v7/recyclerview/src/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.java"" rel=""nofollow"">source of RecyclerView</a> it indeed seems like no such method exists.</p>

<p>Is there actually a way to pass in a payload (do I have an old version of the lib or something), or is the documentation wrong?</p>

<p>Based on the code below... I need a PHP script which uses Regex or some other way to extract the name of the div class which contains the text: <strong>TEXT1</strong>.
In this case, return of the script should be: <strong>CLASSNAME_3</strong></p>

<pre><code> &lt;div class=""CLASSNAME_1""&gt;
  &lt;span class=""CLASSNAME_2""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;div class=""CLASSNAME_3""&gt;
   TEXT1
   &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Reason for the script is, that the name of the class (CLASSNAME_3) is constantly changing, while the content of the class (TEXT1) is not. </p>

<p>I've researched this all over the web and also on stackoverflow, but I am unable to find the answer, nor any similar question which could help me to do this.</p>
